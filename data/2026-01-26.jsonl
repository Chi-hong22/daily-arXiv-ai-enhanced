The proposed approach systematically constructs screw-theoretic PDE models for individual flexible links and rigorously enforces holonomic joint constraints through interaction forces. The dynamics of each link are formulated using a set of dual screws expressed in body-fixed coordinates: one describing the motion of the body-fixed frame relative to the inertial frame, a second relating the body-fixed frame to the undeformed configuration, and a third capturing elastic deformations. By expressing the system energy and applying variational principles, the governing dynamics of each link had been previously derived in a unified manner. Synthesizing the individual link models yields an infinitely scalable multibody representation capable of capturing both local (subsystem-level) and global (system-level) dynamics. The framework explicitly recovers all dynamic states, including the motion of each body-fixed frame and the distributed deformation fields of the flexible links. For computational tractability and mathematical rigor, the resulting governing equations are formulated as a semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic system. Furthermore, by applying separation of variables, the PDE model is recast as an abstract Cauchy problem, and well-posedness of the resulting system is established."}

The system was implemented as an application of the Distributed Multi-Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA) for synchronized multi-host execution. Most existing simulation approaches rely on centralized or non-distributed designs that constrain scalability and limit fully autonomous control. This work introduces two modules built on top of the DMAVA: 1) a Multi-Vehicle AVP Node that performs state-based coordination, queuing, and reservation management across multiple vehicles, and 2) a Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with the DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh-based communication layer that ensures low-latency topic synchronization and coordinated behavior across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909).

We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%).

We present an interview study with 16 victims of online dating romance scams in Iran who were minors when scammed. Findings show that, with westernized dating apps banned in Iran, scammers find teenage victims through messaging platforms tethered to local neighborhoods, offering relief for parental pressures around finding a marital partner and academic performance. Using threats, lies, and exploitation of emotional attachment lacking from their families, scammers pressured minors into financial and sexual favors.

Modeling, control, and optimization of such multi-domain systems play a critical role in achieving building-sector decarbonization. However, most existing tools lack scalability and physical consistency for addressing these complex, multi-scale ecosystem problems. To bridge this gap, this study presents BESTOpt, a modular, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework that unifies building applications, including benchmarking, evaluation, diagnostics, control, optimization, and performance simulation. The framework adopts a cluster-domain-system/building-component hierarchy and a standardized state-action-disturbance-observation data typology. By embedding physics priors into data-driven modules, BESTOpt improves model accuracy and physical consistency under unseen conditions. Case studies on single-building and cluster scenarios demonstrate its capability for multi-level centralized and decentralized control.

In practice, however, different agents may rely on different game-theoretic models to design their strategies. As a result, when these heterogeneous models interact, the realized outcome can deviate substantially from the outcome each agent expects based on its own local model. In this work, we introduce the game-to-real gap, a new metric that quantifies the impact of such model misspecification in multi-agent environments. The game-to-real gap is defined as the difference between the utility an agent actually obtains in the multi-agent environment (where other agents may have misspecified models) and the utility it expects under its own game model. Focusing on quadratic network games, we show that misspecifications in either (i) the external shock or (ii) the player interaction network can lead to arbitrarily large game-to-real gaps. We further develop novel network centrality measures that allow exact evaluation of this gap in quadratic network games. Our analysis reveals that standard network centrality measures fail to capture the effects of model misspecification, underscoring the need for new structural metrics that account for this limitation. Finally, through illustrative numerical experiments, we show that existing centrality measures in network games may provide a counterintuitive understanding of the impact of model misspecification."}

We analyze six complementary attack objectives that target different stages of multimodal processing, including audio encoder representations, cross-modal attention, hidden states, and output likelihoods. Across three state-of-the-art models and multiple benchmarks, we show that audio-only perturbations can induce severe multimodal failures, achieving up to 96% attack success rate. We further show that attacks can be successful at low perceptual distortions (LPIPS <= 0.08, SI-SNR >= 0) and benefit more from extended optimization than increased data scale. Transferability across models and encoders remains limited, while speech recognition systems such as Whisper primarily respond to perturbation magnitude, achieving >97% attack success under severe distortion. These results expose a previously overlooked single-modality attack surface in multimodal systems and motivate defenses that enforce cross-modal consistency."}

Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes.

In this work, we investigate how both explicit and implicit user preferences, as well as the underlying user values, influence agent decision-making and action trajectories. We built a controlled testbed of 14 common interactive web tasks, spanning shopping, travel, dining, and housing, each replicated from real websites and integrated with a low-fidelity LLM-based recommender system. We injected 12 human preferences and values as personas into four state-of-the-art agents and systematically analyzed their task behaviors. Our results show that preference and value-infused prompts consistently guided agents toward outcomes that reflected these preferences and values. While the absence of user preference or value guidance led agents to exhibit a strong efficiency bias and employ shortest-path strategies, their presence steered agents' behavior trajectories through the greater use of corresponding filters and interactive web features. Despite their influence, dominant interface cues, such as discounts and advertisements, frequently overrode these effects, shortening the agents' action trajectories and inducing rationalizations that masked rather than reflected value-consistent reasoning. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) an open-source testbed for studying the influence of values in agent behaviors, and (2) an empirical investigation of how user preferences and values shape web agent behaviors."}

Wearable technology provides unobtrusive sensor data that can be used for the early detection of mental illness. However, current research is limited concerning the variety of psychological instruments administered, physiological modalities, and time series parameters. In this research, we collect the Student Mental and Environmental Health (StudentMEH) Fitbit dataset from students at our institution during the pandemic. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the ability of predictive machine learning models to screen for depression, anxiety, and stress using different Fitbit modalities. Our findings indicate potential in physiological modalities such as heart rate and sleep to screen for mental illness with the F1 scores as high as 0.79 for anxiety, the former modality reaching 0.77 for stress screening, and the latter modality achieving 0.78 for depression. This research highlights the potential of wearable devices to support continuous mental health monitoring, the importance of identifying best data aggregation levels and appropriate modalities for screening for different mental ailments."}

However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline.

FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification.

Conventional uninterruptible power supply (UPS) based AC distribution chains involve multiple conversion stages and line-frequency transformers, which compound losses and are less compatible with dynamic AI power profiles. Although solid-state transformers (SSTs) and 800 VDC distribution architecture are widely discussed, implementable topology/control details, and long-horizon validation with realistic operating profiles remain limited. This paper develops an SST-driven 800 VDC architecture that converts 10 kV MVAC to an 800V LVDC bus using a three-phase H-bridge AC/DC stage cascaded with a dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC/DC stage. A coordinated closed-loop control scheme, combining rectifier voltage/current regulation and DAB phase-shift control, is designed to maintain DC-bus voltage stability. The proposed system is implemented on the real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform and evaluated via sequential simulations using real-world day- and month-scale operating profiles of data centers, benchmarked against a UPS supply chain. Numerical studies demonstrate tight 800 VDC regulation, reduced input-side energy consumption compared with the UPS baseline, and satisfactory power-quality performance. A capacitance sensitivity test quantifies tradeoffs between DC-bus ripple and low-frequency input-power oscillations, yielding a practical capacitance range for design.

Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an \"expert bottleneck\" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy."}

Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods."}

However, these typically require individual, specialized experiments with separate models and identification procedures. This article presents a unified approach to the static calibration of industrial robots that identifies a robot model, including geometric and non-geometric effects (compliant bending, thermal deformation, gear transmission errors), using only a single, straightforward experiment for data collection. The model augments the kinematic chain with virtual joints for each modeled effect and realizes the identification using Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients. Fisher information spectra show that the estimation is well-conditioned and the parameterization near-minimal, whereas systematic temporal cross-validation and model ablations demonstrate robustness of the model identification. The resulting model is very accurate and its identification robust, achieving a mean position error of 26.8 $μm$ on a KUKA KR30 industrial robot compared to 102.3 $μm$ for purely geometric calibration."}

While trust is likely to play a central role in enabling these informal and unsupervised interactions, we still lack an understanding of how people develop and experience it in this context. Seeking to fill this gap, we recruited 24 frequent users of generative AI for emotional support and conducted a qualitative study consisting of diary entries about interactions, transcripts of chats with AI, and in-depth interviews. Our results suggest important novel drivers of trust in this context: familiarity emerging from personalisation, nuanced mental models of generative AI, and awareness of people's control over conversations. Notably, generative AI's homogeneous use of personalised, positive, and persuasive language appears to promote some of these trust-building factors. However, this also seems to discourage other trust-related behaviours, such as remembering that generative AI is a machine trained to converse in human language. We present implications for future research that are likely to become critical as the use of generative AI for emotional support increasingly overlaps with therapeutic work."}

In such scenarios, autonomous task execution at the network edge demands holistic coordination among sensing, communication, computing, and control (SC3) processes. Agentic Artificially Intelligent Radio Access Networks (Agentic AI-RAN) offer a promising paradigm by enabling the edge network to function as an autonomous decision-making entity for low-altitude agents with limited onboard resources. In this article, we propose and design a task-oriented Agentic AI-RAN architecture that enables SC3 task execution within a single edge node.

Furthermore, a representative low-altitude embodied intelligence system is prototyped based on a general-purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform to demonstrate autonomous drone navigation in realistic settings. By leveraging the Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) partitioning technique and the containerized deployment, the demonstration system achieves physical resource isolation while supporting tightly coupled coordination between real-time communication and multimodal inference under a unified task framework.

Ex-ante fairness (proportionality) can trivially be obtained by giving all goods to a random agent. Yet, such an allocation is very unfair ex-post. This has motivated the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) approach, seeking a randomized allocation that is ex-ante proportional and is supported only on ex-post fair allocations (e.g., on allocations that are envy-free-up-to-one-good (EF1), or give some constant fraction of the maximin share (MMS)). It is commonly pointed out that the distribution that allocates all goods to one agent at random fails to be ex-post fair as it ignores the variances of the values of the agents. We examine the approach of trying to mitigate this problem by minimizing the sum-of-variances of the values of the agents, subject to ex-ante proportionality. We study the ex-post fairness properties of the resulting distributions. In support of this approach, observe that such an optimization will indeed deterministically output a proportional allocation if such exists. We show that when valuations are identical, this approach indeed guarantees fairness ex-post: all allocations in the support are envy-free-up-to-any-good (EFX), and thus guarantee every agent at least 4/7 of her maximin share (but not her full MMS). On the negative side, we show that this approach completely fails when valuations are not identical: even in the simplest setting of only two agents and two goods, when the additive valuations are not identical, there is positive probability of allocating both goods to the same agent. Thus, the supporting ex-post allocation might not even be EF1, and might not give an agent any constant fraction of her MMS. Finally, we present similar negative results for other natural minimization objectives that are based on variances."}

Despite being built upon text-based large language models (LLMs), LALMs frequently exhibit a degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize that this limitation stems from the failure of current training paradigms to effectively bridge the acoustic-semantic gap within the feature representation space. To address this challenge, we propose CORD, a unified alignment framework that performs online cross-modal self-distillation. Specifically, it aligns audio-conditioned reasoning with its text-conditioned counterpart within a unified model. Leveraging the text modality as an internal teacher, CORD performs multi-granularity alignment throughout the audio rollout process. At the token level, it employs on-policy reverse KL divergence with importance-aware weighting to prioritize early and semantically critical tokens. At the sequence level, CORD introduces a judge-based global reward to optimize complete reasoning trajectories via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CORD consistently enhances audio-conditioned reasoning and substantially bridges the audio-text performance gap with only 80k synthetic training samples, validating the efficacy and data efficiency of our on-policy, multi-level cross-modal alignment approach."}

The upper-level decision variable parameterizes the reward of the lower-level MDP, and the upper-level objective depends on the optimal induced policy. Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition.

For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods."}

However, previous methods fuse proprioceptive signals directly with VLM-encoded vision-language features, resulting in state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures. We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations."}

At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update.

How Intimate Partners Navigate Boundary-Setting in Mobile Phone Without Words", "comment": "18 pages, 4 tables, CHI2026 Conference", "summary": "Mobile phones, as simultaneously personal and shared technologies, complicate how partners manage digital privacy in intimate relationships. While prior research has examined device-access practices, explicit privacy-rule negotiation, and toxic practices such as surveillance, little is known about how couples manage digital privacy without direct discussion in everyday relationships. To address this gap, we ask: How is digital privacy managed nonverbally and across different media on mobile phones? Drawing on 20 semi-structured interviews, we find that partners often regulate privacy practices through privacy silence -- the intentional avoidance of privacy-related conversations. We identify five motivations for leaving boundaries unspoken: perceiving privacy as unnecessary in intimacy, assuming implicit respect for boundaries, signaling trust and closeness, avoiding potential conflict or harm, and responding to broader societal and cultural expectations that discourage explicit privacy talk. We also identify a hierarchical grouping of content-specific privacy sensitivities, ranging from highly private domains such as financial data to lower-risk domains such as streaming accounts, and show how these priorities shift across relationship stages. These findings show how silence, culture, and content sensitivity shape everyday boundary-setting and underscore the relational and emotional dynamics underpinning mobile phone privacy management."}

We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option.

Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning."}

Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\\% for most workspace regions.

Musicians often struggle to observe the patterns in their playing and interpret them with respect to their goals. Our premise is that these patterns can be made visible with interactive visualization: we can make the unhearable visible. However, understanding the design of such visualizations is challenging: the diversity of needs, including different instruments, skills, musical attributes, and genres, means that any single use case is unlikely to illustrate the broad potential and opportunities. To address this challenge, we conducted a design exploration study where we created and iterated on 33 designs, each focusing on a subset of needs, for example, only one musical skill. Our designs are grounded in our own experience as musicians and the ideas and feedback of 18 musicians with various musical backgrounds and we evaluated them with 13 music learners and teachers. This paper presents the results of our exploration, focusing on a few example designs as instances of possible instrument practice visualizations. From our work, we draw design considerations that contribute to future research and products for visual instrument education."}

While existing engineering solutions rely almost exclusively on instrumental learning, neuroscience shows that humans use Pavlovian associations to leverage predictive cues to bias behavior before outcomes occur. We translate this dual-system mechanism into a cue-guided RL framework in which radio-frequency (RF) stimuli act as conditioned (Pavlovian) cues that modulate action selection. The proposed architecture combines Pavlovian values with instrumental policy optimization, improving navigation efficiency and cooperative behavior in unknown, partially observable environments. Simulation results demonstrate that cue-driven agents adapt faster, achieving superior performance compared to traditional instrumental-solo agents. This work highlights the potential of human learning principles to reshape digital agents intelligence."}

Prior research has mostly focused on maximizing the principal's utility, often resulting in highly disparate payments among agents. Such disparities among agents may be undesirable in practice, for example, in standardized public contracting or worker cooperatives where fairness concerns are essential. Motivated by these considerations, our objective is to quantify the tradeoff between maximizing the principal's utility and equalizing payments among agents, which we call the price of non-discrimination. Our first result is an almost tight bound on the price of non-discrimination, which scales logarithmically with the number of agents. This bound can be improved to a constant by allowing some relaxation of the non-discrimination requirement. We then provide a comprehensive characterization of the tradeoff between the level of non-discrimination and the loss in the optimal utility."}

Hence audio classifiers are easy to manipulate or confuse, resulting in wrong classifications. While inducing a misclassification is not hard, until now the set of features that the classifiers rely on was not well understood.\n  In this paper we introduce a new method that uses causal reasoning to discover features of the frequency space that are sufficient and necessary for a given classification. We describe an implementation of this algorithm in the tool FreqReX and provide experimental results on a number of standard benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that causally sufficient and necessary subsets allow us to manipulate the outputs of the models in a variety of ways by changing the input very slightly. Namely, a change to one out of 240,000 frequencies results in a change in classification 58% of the time, and the change can be so small that it is practically inaudible. These results show that causal analysis is useful for understanding the reasoning process of audio classifiers and can be used to successfully manipulate their outputs."}

In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model. Our work sheds light on the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments to guide the future efforts in the development of AI agents and language models."}

While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios."}

We introduce Adaptive Reinforcement and Model Predictive Control Switching (ARMS), a hybrid learning-control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning follower trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an analytical one-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulated as a quadratic program safety filter. To enable robust perception under partial observability and non-stationary human motion, ARMS employs a decoupled sensing architecture with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) temporal encoder for the human-robot relative state and a spatial encoder for 360-degree LiDAR scans. The core contribution is a learned adaptive neural switcher that performs context-aware soft action fusion between the two controllers, favoring conservative, constraint-aware QP-based control in low-risk regions while progressively shifting control authority to the learned follower in highly cluttered or constrained scenarios where maneuverability is critical, and reverting to the follower action when the QP becomes infeasible. Extensive evaluations against Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), and an RL-only baseline demonstrate that ARMS achieves an 82.5 percent success rate in highly cluttered environments, outperforming DWA and RL-only approaches by 7.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, while reducing average computational latency by 33 percent to 5.2 milliseconds compared to a multi-step MPC baseline. Additional simulation transfer in Gazebo and initial real-world deployment results further indicate the practicality and robustness of ARMS for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration.

Yet little is known about how these displays affect user perceptions in help-seeking contexts. We conducted a 3 x 2 mixed design experiment examining the impact of 'Thinking Content' (None, Emotionally-Supportive, Expertise-Supportive) and 'Conversation Context' (Habit-related vs. Feelings-related problems) on users' perceptions of empathy, warmth, competence, and engagement.

However, how leg crouching enhances sensing is poorly understood, because measuring system vibrations in behaving animals is difficult. We use robophysical modeling to study this problem. Our previous spider robot had only four legs, simplified leg morphology, and a shallow crouching range of motion. Here, we developed a new spider robot, with eight legs, each with four joints that better approximated spider leg morphology. Leg exoskeletons were 3-D printed and joint stiffness was tuned using integrated silicone molding with variable materials and geometry. Tendon-driven actuation allowed a motor in the body to crouch all eight legs deeply as spiders do, while accelerometers at leg joints record leg vibrations. Experiments showed that our new spider robot reproduced key vibration features observed in the previous robot while improving biological accuracy. Our new robot provides a biologically more accurate robophysical model for studying how leg behaviors modulate vibration sensing on a web."}

We present a reflective multi-case analysis of four lab-based user studies with GenAI-integrated prototypes, spanning conversational in-car assistant systems and image generation tools for design workflows. Through cross-case reflection and thematic analysis across all study phases, we identify five methodological challenges and propose eighteen practice-oriented recommendations, organized into five guidelines.

Our guidelines address these challenges through strategies such as reframing onboarding to help participants manage unpredictability, extending evaluation with constructs such as trust and intent alignment, and logging system events, including hallucinations and latency, to support transparent analysis.

LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training.

However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution."}

However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies.

Prior work has mainly focused on mitigating protocol vulnerabilities, with limited attention to how users perceive and interpret what they are authorizing. To examine this usability-security gap, we conducted two formative studies investigating how users interpret authentic signing requests and what cues they rely on to assess risk. Findings reveal that users often misread critical parameters, underestimate high-risk signatures, and rely on superficial familiarity rather than understanding transaction intent. Building on these insights, we designed the Signature Semantic Decoder -- a prototype framework that reconstructs and visualizes the intent behind wallet signatures prior to confirmation. Through structured parsing and semantic labeling, it demonstrates how signing data can be transformed into plain-language explanations with contextual risk cues. In a between-subjects user study (N = 128), participants using the prototype achieved higher accuracy in identifying risky signatures, improved clarity and decision confidence, and lower cognitive workload compared with the baseline wallet interface. Our study reframes wallet signing as a problem of interpretability within secure interaction design and offers design implications for more transparent and trustworthy cryptocurrency wallet interfaces."}

After the stability analysis of equilibria, both in the presence and absence of adopters, we introduce a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that optimizes interventions by shaping opinions rather than directly enforcing adoption. This nudge-based control strategy allows policymakers to influence diffusion indirectly, making interventions more effective and scalable. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, in the absence of control, adoption stagnates, whereas MPC-driven interventions sustain and enhance adoption across communities."}

While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications."}

To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module.

Notice and consent, the standard for collecting consent online, has been criticized. While other individualized solutions have been proposed, this paper argues that a collective approach to consent is worth exploring for several reasons. First, the data of different users is often interlinked, and individual data governance decisions may impact others. Second, harms resulting from data processing are often communal in nature. Finally, having every individual sufficiently informed about data collection practices to ensure truly informed consent has proven impractical.\n  We propose collective consent, operationalized through consent assemblies, as one alternative framework. We establish the theoretical foundations of collective consent and employ speculative design to envision how consent assemblies could function by leveraging deliberative mini-publics. We present two vignettes: i) replacing notice and consent, and ii) collecting consent for GenAI model training, to demonstrate its wide application. Our paper employs future backcasting to identify the requirements for realizing collective consent and explores its potential applications in contexts where individual consent is infeasible."}

In this work, we propose a projection-based method to enforce hard constraints and establish a state-dependent Lipschitz continuity property for the optimal MPC cost function, which enables sharp convergence analysis of the closed-loop system. For the first time, we derive explicit bounds on ReLU network width and depth for approximating MPC policies with guaranteed closed-loop performance.

This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks.

Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs."}

To address this gap, we propose a multimodal data collection framework that employs a dialogue-based interaction protocol and a two-room Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup to simulate robot autonomy while eliciting natural user behavior. The framework records five synchronized modalities: RGB-D video, conversational audio, inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals, end-effector Cartesian pose, and whole-body joint states across five assistive tasks.

Recently, UMH has been shown to present not only conventional vibrotactile sensations but also static pressure sensations by locally rotating an ultrasound focus at several hertz. With these pressure and vibration sensations, UMH covers three mechanoreceptors on which tactile perception relies: SA-I, FA-I, and FA-II. This study proposes a texture rendering method in UMH based on these receptor characteristics. Three basic ultrasonic stimuli corresponding to each mechanoreceptor are designed, and tactile textures are rendered through their combinations. For SA-I, a pressure stimuli were employed. For FA-I and FA-II, vibration stimuli at 30 Hz and 150 Hz, respectively, are employed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can render at least six discriminable textures with different roughness and friction sensations. Notably, through comparisons with real physical objects, we found that the pressure-only stimulus was perceived as slippery and smooth. Its smoothness was similar to a glass-marble. When vibration stimuli were synthesized, the perceived roughness and friction increased significantly. The roughness level reached that of a 100-grit sandpaper."}

Within this class, port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations (pH-DAEs) offer a structured, energy-based representation that preserves interconnection and passivity properties. This work introduces a data-driven identification method that combines port-Hamiltonian neural networks (pHNNs) with a differential-algebraic solver to model such constrained systems directly from noisy input-output data. The approach preserves the passivity and interconnection structure of port-Hamiltonian systems while employing a backward Euler discretization with Newton's method to solve the coupled differential and algebraic equations consistently.

In collector cables connecting wind turbines to offshore MMC, both ends are supplied by Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), which modify the magnitude and characteristics of fault currents. In this context, this paper investigates the limitations of conventional differential protection schemes under such conditions and compares them with enhanced strategies that account for sequence components. Using electromagnetic transient simulations of a representative offshore wind farm modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC software, internal and external fault scenarios are assessed, varying fault types and resistances. The comparative evaluation provides insights into the sensitivity and selectivity of differential protection and guides a deeper conceptual understanding of the evolving protection challenges inherent to future converter-dominated grids."}

A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods."}

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization.

We found that these relationships took varied forms, from one-to-one to one-to-many, and were shaped by multiple actors, including creators, platforms, and moderators. AI partners were perceived as having agency, actively negotiating privacy boundaries with participants and sometimes encouraging disclosure of personal details. As intimacy deepened, these boundaries became more permeable, though some participants voiced concerns such as conversation exposure and sought to preserve anonymity.

We analyze the computational characteristics of both paradigms, present the architectural design of AMBER including its core abstractions, spatial environments, experiment management, and optimization capabilities. Empirical evaluation on three canonical benchmarks demonstrates that AMBER achieves speedups of 1.2x to 93x depending on workload characteristics, with the greatest advantages for models dominated by population-wide attribute operations.

In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable.

In this work, we investigate the representability of floating-point transformers that use floating-point parameters and floating-point operations. Unlike existing results under exact operations, we first show that floating-point transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. Furthermore, we prove that floating-point transformers can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is bounded, but they cannot when the sequence length is large.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks."}

In practice, however, different agents may rely on different game-theoretic models to design their strategies. As a result, when these heterogeneous models interact, the realized outcome can deviate substantially from the outcome each agent expects based on its own local model. In this work, we introduce the game-to-real gap, a new metric that quantifies the impact of such model misspecification in multi-agent environments. The game-to-real gap is defined as the difference between the utility an agent actually obtains in the multi-agent environment (where other agents may have misspecified models) and the utility it expects under its own game model. Focusing on quadratic network games, we show that misspecifications in either (i) the external shock or (ii) the player interaction network can lead to arbitrarily large game-to-real gaps. We further develop novel network centrality measures that allow exact evaluation of this gap in quadratic network games. Our analysis reveals that standard network centrality measures fail to capture the effects of model misspecification, underscoring the need for new structural metrics that account for this limitation. Finally, through illustrative numerical experiments, we show that existing centrality measures in network games may provide a counterintuitive understanding of the impact of model misspecification."}

AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints.

Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability. Despite the tradeoff that persists in many cases, overlooking the role of feature separability may lead to misleading conclusions about robustness."}

VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images.

Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories.

This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions.

Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art counterparts on various real public data sets."}

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains."}

Existing methods predominantly focus on designing complex architectures to fit local data distributions. However, they often overlook the long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity inherent in limited data, thereby struggling to distinguish between few-shot or confusing categories. In the process of knowledge dissemination in the human world, individuals will actively seek expert assistance to transcend the limitations of local thinking. Inspired by this, we introduce an external \"Domain Expert\" and propose an Expert Knowledge-Guided Classification Decision Calibration Network (EKDC-Net) to overcome these challenges. Our framework addresses two core issues: expert knowledge extraction and utilization. Specifically, we first develop a Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM). By leveraging Class Activation Map (CAM) analysis, LPKEM guides the domain expert to focus exclusively on discriminative features essential for classification. Subsequently, to effectively integrate this knowledge, we design an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM). This module dynamically corrects the local model's decisions by considering both overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, we present a large-scale classification dataset covering 102 tree species, named CU-Tree102 to address the issue of scarce diversity in current benchmarks. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We analyze six complementary attack objectives that target different stages of multimodal processing, including audio encoder representations, cross-modal attention, hidden states, and output likelihoods. Across three state-of-the-art models and multiple benchmarks, we show that audio-only perturbations can induce severe multimodal failures, achieving up to 96% attack success rate. We further show that attacks can be successful at low perceptual distortions (LPIPS <= 0.08, SI-SNR >= 0) and benefit more from extended optimization than increased data scale. Transferability across models and encoders remains limited, while speech recognition systems such as Whisper primarily respond to perturbation magnitude, achieving >97% attack success under severe distortion.

Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy.

This work investigates two key components underlying the success of LLMs for TSM: the time series encoder and the multimodal alignment strategy. To this end, we establish a systematic testbed to evaluate their impact across various state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on benchmark ICU datasets against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. Results reveal that the encoder design is more critical than the alignment strategy.

However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \\textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \\textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \\textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model. To enhance \\textbf{interpretability}, DANCE preserves provenance by storing locally inspectable evidence packs that trace predictions to selected neighbors and source text spans. Across 8 TAG datasets, DANCE improves accuracy by \\textbf{2.33\\%} at an \\textbf{8\\%} condensation ratio, with \\textbf{33.42\\%} fewer tokens than baselines."}

However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets.

The system was implemented as an application of the Distributed Multi-Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA) for synchronized multi-host execution. Most existing simulation approaches rely on centralized or non-distributed designs that constrain scalability and limit fully autonomous control. This work introduces two modules built on top of the DMAVA: 1) a Multi-Vehicle AVP Node that performs state-based coordination, queuing, and reservation management across multiple vehicles, and 2) a Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with the DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh-based communication layer that ensures low-latency topic synchronization and coordinated behavior across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARE significantly outperforms baselines in erasure efficacy while preserving general generation quality. Crucially, it maintains persistent hallucination suppression against relearning and parameter updates, validating the effectiveness of geometric stabilization."}

To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources.

Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.\n  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent \"hot-to-cold advantage flip\" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.\n  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated."}

Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM).

To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency.

Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video.

Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning."}

This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments."}

The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion.

While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format.

We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration.

However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization.

Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we refine outputs from the FunSearch algorithm [Romera-Paredes et al., Nature 2023] to derive state-of-the-art lower bounds for standard heuristics. Specifically, we target the generation of adversarial instances where these heuristics perform poorly. By iterating on FunSearch's outputs, we identify improved constructions for hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, the knapsack problem, and a generalization of Lovász's gasoline problem - some of these have not seen much improvement for over a decade, despite intermittent attention.

To demonstrate the framework's real-world applicability, a Swiss Relative Highway Crack Density (RHCD) index was calculated to inform nationwide highway maintenance. The crack classification model achieved an F1-score of $0.84$ for the positive class (crack) and $0.97$ for the negative class (no crack). The Swiss RHCD index exhibited weak correlations with Long-term Land Surface Temperature Amplitudes (LT-LST-A) (Pearson's $r\\ = -0.05$) and Traffic Volume (TV) (Pearson's $r\\ = 0.17$), underlining the added value of this novel index for guiding maintenance over other data. Significantly high RHCD values were observed near urban centers and intersections, providing contextual validation for the predictions.

To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.\n  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent \"hot-to-cold advantage flip\" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.\n  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated."}

In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \\ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map.

Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows.

Despite being built upon text-based large language models (LLMs), LALMs frequently exhibit a degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize that this limitation stems from the failure of current training paradigms to effectively bridge the acoustic-semantic gap within the feature representation space. To address this challenge, we propose CORD, a unified alignment framework that performs online cross-modal self-distillation. Specifically, it aligns audio-conditioned reasoning with its text-conditioned counterpart within a unified model. Leveraging the text modality as an internal teacher, CORD performs multi-granularity alignment throughout the audio rollout process. At the token level, it employs on-policy reverse KL divergence with importance-aware weighting to prioritize early and semantically critical tokens. At the sequence level, CORD introduces a judge-based global reward to optimize complete reasoning trajectories via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CORD consistently enhances audio-conditioned reasoning and substantially bridges the audio-text performance gap with only 80k synthetic training samples, validating the efficacy and data efficiency of our on-policy, multi-level cross-modal alignment approach."}

In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantee that grade-wise training yields provable vanishing approximation error in deep networks.

Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BrepARG validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation."}

Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead."}

The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature.

Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion.

We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs."}

We first propose \\textbf{E}quivariant \\textbf{A}xis-\\textbf{A}ligned \\textbf{S}parsification (EAAS). EAAS builds on Wigner-$6j$ convolution by exploiting an $\\mathrm{SO}(3) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SO}(2)$ change of basis to transform computationally expensive dense tensor contractions into efficient, sparse parity re-indexing operations. Building on this representation, we introduce \\textbf{On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention}, a fully node-centric mechanism implemented via a custom fused Triton kernel. By eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, our kernel achieves a \\textbf{20$\\times$ improvement in TFLOPS} compared to standard implementations.

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains."}

We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design."}

While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks."}

Seeking to fill this gap, we recruited 24 frequent users of generative AI for emotional support and conducted a qualitative study consisting of diary entries about interactions, transcripts of chats with AI, and in-depth interviews. Our results suggest important novel drivers of trust in this context: familiarity emerging from personalisation, nuanced mental models of generative AI, and awareness of people's control over conversations. Notably, generative AI's homogeneous use of personalised, positive, and persuasive language appears to promote some of these trust-building factors. However, this also seems to discourage other trust-related behaviours, such as remembering that generative AI is a machine trained to converse in human language.

Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor.

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization.

Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}~cubes and a mug.

Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding.

In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding."}

While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation."}

To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space.

In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures.

While agents replicate patterns, such as modal split by socioeconomic status, they show systematic biases in trip length and mode preference. GTA offers new opportunities for modeling how future innovations, from bike lanes to transit apps, shape mobility decisions."}

The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training."}

In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation."}

To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction. SMMF aims to ensure the diversity of fusion for different panoramic image regions and reduce the breakage of cylinder side surface expansion in ERP projection, which uses different fusion strategies to match the different regions in panoramic images. Experimental results show that REL-SF4PASS considerably improves performance and robustness on popular benchmark, Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets. It gains 2.35% average mIoU improvement on all 3 folds and reduces the performance variance by approximately 70% when facing 3D disturbance."}

We analyze six complementary attack objectives that target different stages of multimodal processing, including audio encoder representations, cross-modal attention, hidden states, and output likelihoods. Across three state-of-the-art models and multiple benchmarks, we show that audio-only perturbations can induce severe multimodal failures, achieving up to 96% attack success rate.

Transferability across models and encoders remains limited, while speech recognition systems such as Whisper primarily respond to perturbation magnitude, achieving >97% attack success under severe distortion. These results expose a previously overlooked single-modality attack surface in multimodal systems and motivate defenses that enforce cross-modal consistency."}

We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design."}

In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing.

SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step.

To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts.

We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations."}

Kelly", "Hana Chockler"], "title": "I Guess That's Why They Call it the Blues: Causal Analysis for Audio Classifiers", "comment": null, "summary": "It is well-known that audio classifiers often rely on non-musically relevant features and spurious correlations to classify audio. Hence audio classifiers are easy to manipulate or confuse, resulting in wrong classifications. While inducing a misclassification is not hard, until now the set of features that the classifiers rely on was not well understood.\n  In this paper we introduce a new method that uses causal reasoning to discover features of the frequency space that are sufficient and necessary for a given classification. We describe an implementation of this algorithm in the tool FreqReX and provide experimental results on a number of standard benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that causally sufficient and necessary subsets allow us to manipulate the outputs of the models in a variety of ways by changing the input very slightly. Namely, a change to one out of 240,000 frequencies results in a change in classification 58% of the time, and the change can be so small that it is practically inaudible. These results show that causal analysis is useful for understanding the reasoning process of audio classifiers and can be used to successfully manipulate their outputs."}

While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.\n  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation."}

We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs."}

However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies. This finding is particularly relevant for applications with limited training data, a common scenario patient care."}

We find that the TESSERA -based approach to land cover and crop type mapping fulfills the selection criteria best, and in one temporal transfer example shows 28% higher accuracy compared to the next best method.

While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation."}

However, determining the required network complexity to ensure closed-loop performance remains a fundamental open problem. This involves a critical precision-complexity trade-off: undersized networks may fail to capture the MPC policy, while oversized ones may outweigh the benefits of ReLU network approximation. In this work, we propose a projection-based method to enforce hard constraints and establish a state-dependent Lipschitz continuity property for the optimal MPC cost function, which enables sharp convergence analysis of the closed-loop system. For the first time, we derive explicit bounds on ReLU network width and depth for approximating MPC policies with guaranteed closed-loop performance. To further reduce network complexity and enhance closed-loop performance, we propose a non-uniform error framework with a state-aware scaling function to adaptively adjust both the input and output of the ReLU network. Our contributions provide a foundational step toward certifiable ReLU NN-based MPC."}

The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training."}

In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BrepARG validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation."}

Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier. Furthermore, testing on the DarkBench safety suite reveals intrinsic alignment properties, with peer-mediated correction reducing sycophancy scores below that of any individual agent."}

However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation."}
