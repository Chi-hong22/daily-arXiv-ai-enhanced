### [1] [WD-DETR: Wavelet Denoising-Enhanced Real-Time Object Detection Transformer for Robot Perception with Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09098)
*Yangjie Cui,Boyang Gao,Yiwei Zhang,Xin Dong,Jinwu Xiang,Daochun Li,Zhan Tu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波去噪的检测变换器（WD-DETR）网络，用于解决事件相机中密集事件表示的噪声问题，提升检测性能并实现实时处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集事件表示中的累积噪声会降低表示质量并增加漏检概率，现有研究对此关注不足。

Method: 提出密集事件表示并设计小波变换去噪方法，将其集成到特征提取主干网络中，随后通过变换器网络进行目标预测，并引入动态重组卷积块（DRCB）以减少推理时间。

Result: 在DSEC、Gen1和1Mpx数据集上，WD-DETR优于现有方法，并在NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX上实现约35 FPS的高帧率。

Conclusion: WD-DETR有效解决了事件相机中的噪声问题，提升了检测性能，并适用于实时机器人感知。

Abstract: Previous studies on event camera sensing have demonstrated certain detection
performance using dense event representations. However, the accumulated noise
in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which
degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed
detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet
Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event
cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which
enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet
transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such
a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted
features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object
prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic
Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid
encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object
detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that
WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement
our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin
NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16,
which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic
systems.

*Yuemin Mao,Bardienus P. Duisterhof,Moonyoung Lee,Jeffrey Ichnowski*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过声学传感学习摩擦模型的方法，优化非抓取式物体运输任务，显著减少物体位移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于库仑摩擦模型的约束在快速运动时不够精确，导致物体滑动或掉落，需要更准确的动态摩擦模型。

Method: 利用声学传感学习动态摩擦系数，结合优化运动规划器调整每一步的摩擦约束。

Result: 实验显示，学习模型比标准库仑模型减少物体位移达86.0%。

Conclusion: 声学传感能有效学习真实摩擦约束，提升非抓取式运输的效率和安全性。

Abstract: Object transport tasks are fundamental in robotic automation, emphasizing the
importance of efficient and secure methods for moving objects. Non-prehensile
transport can significantly improve transport efficiency, as it enables
handling multiple objects simultaneously and accommodating objects unsuitable
for parallel-jaw or suction grasps. Existing approaches incorporate constraints
based on the Coulomb friction model, which is imprecise during fast motions
where inherent mechanical vibrations occur. Imprecise constraints can cause
transported objects to slide or even fall off the tray. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel method to learn a friction model using acoustic
sensing that maps a tray's motion profile to a dynamically conditioned friction
coefficient. This learned model enables an optimization-based motion planner to
adjust the friction constraint at each control step according to the planned
motion at that step. In experiments, we generate time-optimized trajectories
for a UR5e robot to transport various objects with constraints using both the
standard Coulomb friction model and the learned friction model. Results suggest
that the learned friction model reduces object displacement by up to 86.0%
compared to the baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of acoustic sensing in
learning real-world friction constraints.

### [3] [Towards Full-Scenario Safety Evaluation of Automated Vehicles: A Volume-Based Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09182)
*Hang Zhou,Chengyuan Ma,Shiyu Shen,Xiaopeng Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的全场景自动驾驶车辆（AV）安全评估框架，解决了现有方法在复杂环境中评估高自动化功能的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AV安全评估方法主要针对简单操作（如跟车和变道），难以适用于复杂环境中的高自动化功能评估，且依赖高质量自然驾驶数据，计算复杂度高。

Method: 提出统一模型标准化驾驶场景表示，将场景维度限制为常规高速公路设置；引入基于体积的评估方法，量化风险场景比例。

Result: 实验验证了基于体积的方法的有效性，使用文献中的AV行为模型和实际测试数据校准的AV模型。

Conclusion: 新框架显著降低了评估维度，避免了概率方法的局限性，为AV安全评估提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: With the rapid development of automated vehicles (AVs) in recent years,
commercially available AVs are increasingly demonstrating high-level automation
capabilities. However, most existing AV safety evaluation methods are primarily
designed for simple maneuvers such as car-following and lane-changing. While
suitable for basic tests, these methods are insufficient for assessing
high-level automation functions deployed in more complex environments. First,
these methods typically use crash rate as the evaluation metric, whose accuracy
heavily depends on the quality and completeness of naturalistic driving
environment data used to estimate scenario probabilities. Such data is often
difficult and expensive to collect. Second, when applied to diverse scenarios,
these methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, making large-scale
evaluation computationally intractable. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a novel framework for full-scenario AV safety evaluation. A unified
model is first introduced to standardize the representation of diverse driving
scenarios. This modeling approach constrains the dimension of most scenarios to
a regular highway setting with three lanes and six surrounding background
vehicles, significantly reducing dimensionality. To further avoid the
limitations of probability-based method, we propose a volume-based evaluation
method that quantifies the proportion of risky scenarios within the entire
scenario space. For car-following scenarios, we prove that the set of safe
scenarios is convex under specific settings, enabling exact volume computation.
Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed volume-based
method using both AV behavior models from existing literature and six
production AV models calibrated from field-test trajectory data in the Ultra-AV
dataset. Code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this
paper.

### [4] [Perception Characteristics Distance: Measuring Stability and Robustness of Perception System in Dynamic Conditions under a Certain Decision Rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09217)
*Boyu Jiang,Liang Shi,Zhengzhi Lin,Loren Stowe,Feng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的感知评估指标PCD，用于量化物体可靠检测的最远距离，并结合模型输出的不确定性。同时发布了SensorRainFall数据集，用于评估不同天气条件下的感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感知评估指标是静态的，无法捕捉模型输出置信度的动态变化，尤其是在不同距离和天气条件下。

Method: 提出了PCD指标，结合SensorRainFall数据集（包含晴天和雨天场景的传感器数据），通过统计分析检测置信度方差的变化点。

Result: PCD能够有效捕捉不同天气条件下感知系统的可靠性差异，而传统静态指标无法做到。

Conclusion: PCD为感知性能提供了分布感知的评估方法，支持更安全的自动驾驶系统运行；SensorRainFall数据集为评估提供了基准。

Abstract: The performance of perception systems in autonomous driving systems (ADS) is
strongly influenced by object distance, scene dynamics, and environmental
conditions such as weather. AI-based perception outputs are inherently
stochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while
traditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to
capture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the
Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that
quantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected,
incorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the
SensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a
sensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear
and daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target
objects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the
variance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD
values across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic
thresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall
perception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance.
Applying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful
reliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that
static metrics overlook. PCD provides a principled, distribution-aware measure
of perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation,
while the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation.
The SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datadrivenwheels/sensorrainfall, and the
evaluation code is open-sourced at

### [5] [UAD: Unsupervised Affordance Distillation for Generalization in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09284)
*Yihe Tang,Wenlong Huang,Yingke Wang,Chengshu Li,Roy Yuan,Ruohan Zhang,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UAD是一种无监督方法，通过从基础模型中提取知识，无需手动标注即可训练任务条件化的视觉功能模型，并在机器人场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉功能预测方法依赖手动标注或预定义任务集，限制了其在开放任务指令下的应用。

Method: UAD利用大型视觉模型和视觉语言模型的互补优势，自动标注大规模数据集，并训练轻量级任务条件化解码器。

Result: UAD在仿真环境中训练，但在真实机器人场景和人类活动中表现出泛化能力，模仿学习策略在少量演示后能泛化到新对象和任务。

Conclusion: UAD为无监督视觉功能学习提供了有效方法，展示了在开放任务指令下的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to
manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task
instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often
rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of
tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for
distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned
affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD
automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction,
visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned
decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to
in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being
trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as
the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates
promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and
even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10
demonstrations. Project website: https://unsup-affordance.github.io/

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold significant potential in accomplishing daily tasks
across diverse environments thanks to their flexibility and human-like
morphology. Recent works have made significant progress in humanoid whole-body
control and loco-manipulation leveraging optimal control or reinforcement
learning. However, these methods require tedious task-specific tuning for each
task to achieve satisfactory behaviors, limiting their versatility and
scalability to diverse tasks in daily scenarios. To that end, we introduce
SkillBlender, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
versatile humanoid loco-manipulation. SkillBlender first pretrains
goal-conditioned task-agnostic primitive skills, and then dynamically blends
these skills to accomplish complex loco-manipulation tasks with minimal
task-specific reward engineering. We also introduce SkillBench, a parallel,
cross-embodiment, and diverse simulated benchmark containing three embodiments,
four primitive skills, and eight challenging loco-manipulation tasks,
accompanied by a set of scientific evaluation metrics balancing accuracy and
feasibility. Extensive simulated experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms all baselines, while naturally regularizing behaviors to avoid
reward hacking, resulting in more accurate and feasible movements for diverse
loco-manipulation tasks in our daily scenarios. Our code and benchmark will be
open-sourced to the community to facilitate future research. Project page:

Conclusion: 该研究提供了难以通过实验获取的肌肉级平衡动态见解，为平衡障碍干预和人形机器人发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While
dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention,
quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This
work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via
a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal
dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle
injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned
with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance
demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under
perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance
dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a
foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance
impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人手与机器人手之间的机械差异，完全复现人手运动是不可能的。现有研究缺乏对这些重定向目标的实验比较，因此其重要性和有效性尚不明确。

Result: 实验结果表明，综合目标公式在运动姿势重定向和实际遥操作任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更准确有效的重定向算法提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Kinematic retargeting from human hands to robot hands is essential for
transferring dexterity from humans to robots in manipulation teleoperation and
imitation learning. However, due to mechanical differences between human and
robot hands, completely reproducing human motions on robot hands is impossible.
Existing works on retargeting incorporate various optimization objectives,
focusing on different aspects of hand configuration. However, the lack of
experimental comparative studies leaves the significance and effectiveness of
these objectives unclear. This work aims to analyze these retargeting
objectives for dexterous manipulation through extensive real-world comparative
experiments. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive retargeting objective
formulation that integrates intuitively crucial factors appearing in recent
approaches. The significance of each factor is evaluated through experimental
ablation studies on the full objective in kinematic posture retargeting and
real-world teleoperated manipulation tasks. Experimental results and
conclusions provide valuable insights for designing more accurate and effective
retargeting algorithms for real-world dexterous manipulation.

Conclusion: 扩展了四足机器人腿部的功能，证明了其在动态任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Quadruped robots have made significant advances in locomotion, extending
their capabilities from controlled environments to real-world applications.
Beyond movement, recent work has explored loco-manipulation using the legs to
perform tasks such as pressing buttons or opening doors. While these efforts
demonstrate the feasibility of leg-based manipulation, most have focused on
relatively static tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that enables
quadruped robots to collect objects without additional actuators by leveraging
the agility of their legs. By attaching a simple scoop-like add-on to one leg,
the robot can scoop objects and toss them into a collection tray mounted on its
back. Our method employs a hierarchical policy structure comprising two expert
policies-one for scooping and tossing, and one for approaching object
positions-and a meta-policy that dynamically switches between them. The expert
policies are trained separately, followed by meta-policy training for
coordinated multi-object collection. This approach demonstrates how quadruped
legs can be effectively utilized for dynamic object manipulation, expanding
their role beyond locomotion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adv-BMT框架通过双向运动变换器生成多样且真实的对抗性交互，解决了自动驾驶测试中长尾安全关键场景数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集中长尾安全关键场景稀缺，限制了自动驾驶系统的测试效果。

Method: Adv-BMT框架采用双向运动变换器（BMT）进行逆向交通运动预测，无需碰撞数据预训练，生成多样且真实的碰撞交互。

Result: 实验表明，使用Adv-BMT生成的数据训练可将碰撞率降低20%。

Conclusion: Adv-BMT有效提升了自动驾驶测试场景的多样性和真实性。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of
autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the
scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets
collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT
framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic
adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional
motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions,
which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input,
and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the
initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first
conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions.
Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for
pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision
interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated
collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce
episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种时间统一的扩散策略（TUDP），通过动作识别能力构建时间统一的去噪过程，提高了机器人动作生成的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在机器人模仿学习中表现良好，但现有方法存在实时性差和动作精度低的问题。

Method: TUDP构建了时间统一的速度场，并引入动作判别分支提供额外信息，通过动作级训练提高去噪精度。

Result: 在RLBench上取得最高成功率（多视图82.6%，单视图83.8%），尤其在较少去噪迭代时表现更优。

Conclusion: TUDP显著提升了机器人动作生成的效率和准确性，适用于广泛的实际任务。

Abstract: In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models
to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion
model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs
well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However,
the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to
iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic
manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action
denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model
training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions
efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy
(TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified
denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in
action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all
timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of
policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose
an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination
branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through
action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern
successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6%
on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when
using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement
in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide
range of real-world tasks.

Abstract: Esophageal cancer remains a highly aggressive malignancy with low survival
rates, requiring advanced surgical interventions like esophagectomy.
Traditional manual techniques, including circular staplers, face challenges
such as limited precision, prolonged recovery times, and complications like

stapler designed to enhance the dexterity in confined spaces, improve tissue
alignment, and reduce post-operative risks. Integrated with a cognitive robot
that serves as a surgeon's assistant, the surgical stapler uses three actuators
to perform anvil motion, cutter/stapler motion and allows a 75-degree bending
of the cartridge (distal tip). Kinematic analysis is used to compute the
stapler tip's position, ensuring synchronization with a robotic system.

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优异，抓取成功率提升44%。

Conclusion: DCIRNet有效解决了透明和反射物体的深度估计问题，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects in everyday environments pose significant
challenges for depth sensors due to their unique visual properties, such as
specular reflections and light transmission. These characteristics often lead
to incomplete or inaccurate depth estimation, which severely impacts downstream
geometry-based vision tasks, including object recognition, scene
reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. To address the issue of missing depth
information in transparent and reflective objects, we propose DCIRNet, a novel
multimodal depth completion network that effectively integrates RGB images and
depth maps to enhance depth estimation quality. Our approach incorporates an
innovative multimodal feature fusion module designed to extract complementary
information between RGB images and incomplete depth maps. Furthermore, we
introduce a multi-stage supervision and depth refinement strategy that
progressively improves depth completion and effectively mitigates the issue of
blurred object boundaries. We integrate our depth completion model into
dexterous grasping frameworks and achieve a $44\%$ improvement in the grasp
success rate for transparent and reflective objects. We conduct extensive
experiments on public datasets, where DCIRNet demonstrates superior
performance. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach and confirm its strong generalization capability across various
transparent and reflective objects.

Abstract: In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is
robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and
deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model
named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information
(foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between
robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its
adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or
transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural
adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg
kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of
this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to
retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real
experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy
beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain,

Abstract: The robust interpretation of 3D environments is crucial for human-robot
collaboration (HRC) applications, where safety and operational efficiency are
paramount. Semantic segmentation plays a key role in this context by enabling a
precise and detailed understanding of the environment. Considering the intense
data hunger for real-world industrial annotated data essential for effective

Abstract: This paper introduces an underwater multi-robot platform, named Aucamp,
characterized by cost-effective monocular-camera-based sensing, distributed
protocol and robust orientation control for localization. We utilize the
clarity feature to measure the distance, present the monocular imaging model,
and estimate the position of the target object. We achieve global positioning
in our platform by designing a distributed update protocol. The distributed
algorithm enables the perception process to simultaneously cover a broader
range, and greatly improves the accuracy and robustness of the positioning.
Moreover, the explicit dynamics model of the robot in our platform is obtained,
based on which, we propose a robust orientation control framework. The control
system ensures that the platform maintains a balanced posture for each robot,
thereby ensuring the stability of the localization system. The platform can
swiftly recover from an forced unstable state to a stable horizontal posture.
Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments and application scenarios to
evaluate the performance of our platform. The proposed new platform may provide
support for extensive marine exploration by underwater sensor networks.

Abstract: Localization plays a crucial role in the navigation capabilities of

present unique challenges that necessitate real-time localization and

Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to generate reliable 3D odometry. To further
enhance the localization accuracy, Visual SLAM (VSLAM) is employed, resulting
in the creation of a comprehensive 3D point cloud map. By leveraging these
sensor technologies and advanced algorithms, the prototype offers a
comprehensive solution for outdoor localization in autonomous mobile robots,
enabling them to navigate and map their surroundings with confidence and

Abstract: Dynamic locomotion of legged robots is a critical yet challenging topic in
expanding the operational range of mobile robots. It requires precise planning
when possible footholds are sparse, robustness against uncertainties and
disturbances, and generalizability across diverse terrains. While traditional
model-based controllers excel at planning on complex terrains, they struggle
with real-world uncertainties. Learning-based controllers offer robustness to
such uncertainties but often lack precision on terrains with sparse steppable
areas. Hybrid methods achieve enhanced robustness on sparse terrains by
combining both methods but are computationally demanding and constrained by the
inherent limitations of model-based planners. To achieve generalized legged
locomotion on diverse terrains while preserving the robustness of
learning-based controllers, this paper proposes to learn an attention-based map
encoding conditioned on robot proprioception, which is trained as part of the
end-to-end controller using reinforcement learning. We show that the network
learns to focus on steppable areas for future footholds when the robot
dynamically navigates diverse and challenging terrains. We synthesize behaviors
that exhibit robustness against uncertainties while enabling precise and agile
traversal of sparse terrains. Additionally, our method offers a way to
interpret the topographical perception of a neural network. We have trained two
controllers for a 12-DoF quadrupedal robot and a 23-DoF humanoid robot
respectively and tested the resulting controllers in the real world under
various challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios, including ones unseen during
training.

Abstract: Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as
proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and
generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong
generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant
challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously
learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this
issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for
continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a
task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a
single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares
(RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific
models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model
selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The
scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics
(autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant
learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a
real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to
forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight
ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning
in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our
code will be available at

Abstract: Autonomous racing has emerged as a crucial testbed for autonomous driving
algorithms, necessitating a simulation environment for both vehicle dynamics
and sensor behavior. Striking the right balance between vehicle dynamics and
sensor accuracy is crucial for pushing vehicles to their performance limits.
However, autonomous racing developers often face a trade-off between accurate
vehicle dynamics and high-fidelity sensor simulations. This paper introduces
R-CARLA, an enhancement of the CARLA simulator that supports holistic
full-stack testing, from perception to control, using a single system. By
seamlessly integrating accurate vehicle dynamics with sensor simulations,
opponents simulation as NPCs, and a pipeline for creating digital twins from
real-world robotic data, R-CARLA empowers researchers to push the boundaries of
autonomous racing development. Furthermore, it is developed using CARLA's rich
suite of sensor simulations. Our results indicate that incorporating the
proposed digital-twin framework into R-CARLA enables more realistic full-stack
testing, demonstrating a significant reduction in the Sim-to-Real gap of car
dynamics simulation by 42% and by 82% in the case of sensor simulation across
various testing scenarios.

Abstract: Nowadays, industries are showing a growing interest in human-robot

findings, showcasing the advantages of DMPs in enhancing human-robot
interaction and improving user experience.

Abstract: Warehouse automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing operational
efficiency, minimizing costs, and improving resilience to workforce
variability. While prior research has demonstrated the potential of machine
learning (ML) models to increase picking success rates in large-scale robotic
fleets by prioritizing high-probability picks and packages, these efforts
primarily focused on predicting success probabilities for picks sampled using
heuristic methods. Limited attention has been given, however, to leveraging
data-driven approaches to directly optimize sampled picks for better
performance at scale. In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that
predicts transform adjustments as well as improving the selection of suction
cups for multi-suction end effectors for sampled picks to enhance their success
probabilities. The framework was integrated and evaluated in test workcells
that resemble the operations of Amazon Robotics' Robot Induction (Robin) fleet,
which is used for package manipulation. Evaluated on over 2 million picks, the
proposed method achieves a 20\% reduction in pick failure rates compared to a
heuristic-based pick sampling baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in
large-scale warehouse automation scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for
directly mapping sensor inputs to planning maneuvers using learning-based
modular integrations. However, existing imitation learning (IL)-based models
suffer from generalization to hard cases, and a lack of corrective feedback
loop under post-deployment. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
potential solution to tackle hard cases with optimality, it is often hindered
by overfitting to specific driving cases, resulting in catastrophic forgetting
of generalizable knowledge and sample inefficiency. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Reinforced Refinement with Self-aware Expansion (R2SE),
a novel learning pipeline that constantly refines hard domain while keeping
generalizable driving policy for model-agnostic end-to-end driving systems.
Through reinforcement fine-tuning and policy expansion that facilitates
continuous improvement, R2SE features three key components: 1) Generalist
Pretraining with hard-case allocation trains a generalist imitation learning
(IL) driving system while dynamically identifying failure-prone cases for
targeted refinement; 2) Residual Reinforced Specialist Fine-tuning optimizes
residual corrections using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance
in hard case domain while preserving global driving knowledge; 3) Self-aware
Adapter Expansion dynamically integrates specialist policies back into the
generalist model, enhancing continuous performance improvement. Experimental
results in closed-loop simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate
improvements in generalization, safety, and long-horizon policy robustness over
state-of-the-art E2E systems, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforce
refinement for scalable autonomous driving.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for robot navigation
in dynamic environments with heterogeneous constraints. Our approach leverages
a graph neural network trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently
estimate the robot's cost-to-go, formulated as local goal recommendations. A
spatio-temporal path-searching module, which accounts for kinematic
constraints, is then employed to generate a reference trajectory to facilitate
solving the non-convex optimization problem used for explicit constraint
enforcement. More importantly, we introduce an incremental action-masking
mechanism and a privileged learning strategy, enabling end-to-end training of
the proposed planner. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively addresses local planning in complex
dynamic environments, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared
with existing learning-optimization hybrid methods, our approach eliminates the
dependency on high-fidelity simulation environments, offering significant
advantages in computational efficiency and training scalability. The code will
be released as open-source upon acceptance of the paper.

  This dissertation introduces scalable MRPP methods with provable guarantees

m_2}{2}$ robots, solving large instances efficiently and setting a new
theoretical benchmark.
  Next, we address real-world MRPP. We design optimal layouts for structured
environments (e.g., warehouses, parking systems) and propose a puzzle-based
system for dense, deadlock-free autonomous vehicle parking. We also extend MRPP
to Reeds-Shepp robots, introducing motion primitives and smoothing techniques
to ensure feasible, efficient paths under nonholonomic constraints. Simulations
and real-world tests validate the approach in urban driving and robotic
transport scenarios.

Abstract: One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional
imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization
capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile,
"generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain
insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to
the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that
incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend
to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization
capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies
on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,
which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this
gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across
10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We
systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this
suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that
while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high
level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably
translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution
observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action
execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's
generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code
to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on
closing the perception-to-action gap. More information, including the source
code, can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/INT-ACT/

Abstract: Safe navigation of steerable and robotic catheters in the cerebral
vasculature requires awareness of the catheters shape and pose. Currently, a
significant perception burden is placed on interventionalists to mentally
reconstruct and predict catheter motions from biplane fluoroscopy images.
Efforts to track these catheters are limited to planar segmentation or bulky
sensing instrumentation, which are incompatible with microcatheters used in
neurointervention. In this work, a catheter is equipped with custom radiopaque
markers arranged to enable simultaneous shape and pose estimation under biplane
fluoroscopy. A design measure is proposed to guide the arrangement of these
markers to minimize sensitivity to marker tracking uncertainty. This approach
was deployed for microcatheters smaller than 2mm OD navigating phantom
vasculature with shape tracking errors less than 1mm and catheter roll errors
below 40 degrees. This work can enable steerable catheters to autonomously
navigate under biplane imaging.

Abstract: While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic
behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited
success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these
policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector
that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for
help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or
a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect
failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we
introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure
detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature
space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task
success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this
insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a
single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on
both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is
compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$,
and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We
compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves
state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between
accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction. More qualitative
results can be found at https://vla-safe.github.io/.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层架构，结合梯度无关和梯度方法，解决腿式机器人实时控制中的非线性、混合和高维问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腿式机器人的非线性、混合和高维特性导致实时稳定和最优控制困难。

Method: 采用分层架构，分离离散变量选择和光滑MPC，结合采样和梯度方法。

Result: 在四足和双足机器人上验证，比启发式方法更优、比纯采样方法更快。

Conclusion: 分层架构在实时性和最优性上表现优异。

Abstract: Computing stabilizing and optimal control actions for legged locomotion in
real time is difficult due to the nonlinear, hybrid, and high dimensional
nature of these robots. The hybrid nature of the system introduces a
combination of discrete and continuous variables which causes issues for
numerical optimal control. To address these challenges, we propose a layered
architecture that separates the choice of discrete variables and a smooth Model
Predictive Controller (MPC). The layered formulation allows for online
flexibility and optimality without sacrificing real-time performance through a
combination of gradient-free and gradient-based methods. The architecture
leverages a sampling-based method for determining discrete variables, and a
classical smooth MPC formulation using these fixed discrete variables. We
demonstrate the results on a quadrupedal robot stepping over gaps and onto
terrain with varying heights. In simulation, we demonstrate the controller on a
humanoid robot for gap traversal. The layered approach is shown to be more
optimal and reliable than common heuristic-based approaches and faster to
compute than pure sampling methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Chain-of-Action (CoA) 是一种基于轨迹自回归建模的新型视觉运动策略范式，通过反向推理生成完整轨迹，实现了任务目标的全局约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅预测下一步动作，缺乏全局目标约束。CoA 旨在通过反向推理和任务目标驱动的动作链（CoT）过程，提升策略的全局性和空间泛化能力。

Method: CoA 采用自回归结构：首动作标记为关键帧动作，编码任务目标；后续动作标记基于关键帧和先前动作生成。设计包括连续动作标记表示、动态停止、反向时间集成和多标记预测。

Result: CoA 在 60 个 RLBench 任务和 8 个真实世界操作任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CoA 通过反向推理和全局约束设计，显著提升了视觉运动策略的空间泛化能力和任务性能。

Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built
upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that
predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by
explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single
autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe
action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens
are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and
previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a
global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained
by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA
incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token
representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;
reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk
modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial
generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of
a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: eFlesh是一种低成本、易定制、基于磁力的触觉传感器，用于机器人操作，填补了现有触觉传感器的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需要在非结构化环境中感知物理交互的力，但现有触觉传感器缺乏通用性和可定制性，导致解决方案分散或完全忽略力的感知。

Method: eFlesh传感器由3D打印的微结构、磁铁和磁力计电路板组成，通过开源设计工具实现几何和机械响应的定制。

Result: 实验显示，eFlesh在接触定位和力预测上表现优异，并显著提升了机器人操作的精度和成功率。

Conclusion: eFlesh为机器人触觉感知提供了低成本、高定制化的解决方案，推动了非结构化环境中的机器人操作能力。

Abstract: If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured
environments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces
during physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and
easily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific
solutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware,
sensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a
magnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly
customizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a
hobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired
shape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled,
parameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and
its mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts
convex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular
design framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to
adjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization
experiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE
of 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for
shear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to
unseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that
improve manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving
91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy
for successful completion. All design files, code and the CAD-to-eFlesh STL
conversion tool are open-sourced and available on https://e-flesh.com.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReStNet提出了一种可重用和可拼接的网络，通过动态拼接两个预训练模型来适应异构设备资源，实现灵活的效率-精度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在异构设备上部署的挑战，传统压缩方法无法适应动态资源约束。

Method: 通过CKA计算层间相似度选择拼接点，保留大模型早期层和小模型深层，仅微调拼接层。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现灵活的效率-精度权衡，显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ReStNet为异构设备部署提供了一种高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained
models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in
real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess
heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to
deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression
methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve
efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing
resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable
and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by
stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires
addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal
stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,
and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these
challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the
stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers
from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To
facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This
design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging
available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,
Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,
allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training
cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对生成式医学视觉语言模型（Med-VLMs）的安全防御策略，旨在解决其可能面临的恶意查询问题，同时避免过度防御影响正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-VLMs在生成复杂医学文本信息时存在安全漏洞，可能被用于恶意目的（如保险欺诈），但现有研究对此关注不足。同时，过度防御可能导致模型拒绝正常临床查询。

Method: 提出了一种基于合成临床示例的推理时防御策略，通过多样化的医学影像数据集验证其有效性，并引入混合示例策略以平衡安全性和性能。

Result: 实验表明，该策略能有效防御视觉和文本攻击，且增加示例预算可缓解过度防御问题。混合策略在少样本预算下实现了安全与性能的平衡。

Conclusion: 该防御策略为Med-VLMs的安全性和实用性提供了可行的解决方案，尤其在资源受限的场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed
to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from
multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language
modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities
remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries,
such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for
insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the
risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general
performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper,
we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries,
enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse
medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that
our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model
safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find
that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We
then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for
balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget
constraints.

Motivation: 建筑数字化发展中，墙窗自动分割是提升建筑信息模型和CAD效率的关键步骤。

Method: 结合多模态语义协作特征提取机制和端到端训练框架，融合文本描述与图像特征。

Result: 在多个立面数据集上，SAAF的分割结果在mIoU指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAAF在墙窗分割任务的精度和泛化能力上取得进展，为建筑计算机视觉技术和多模态学习应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic
segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of
building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an
automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on
multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF).
First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction
mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the
semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the
semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an
end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the
mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the
influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the
automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive
experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF
outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF
model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse
datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and
generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected
to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision
technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application
of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

Motivation: 视频推理领域因缺乏高质量数据和有效训练方法而发展不足，需填补这一空白。

Method: 通过DarkEventInfer和MixVidQA数据集训练模型，结合强化学习，开发VersaVid-R1模型。

Result: VersaVid-R1在多项任务中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: VersaVid-R1是首个多功能视频理解与推理模型，填补了领域空白并表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully
extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet
video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the
scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training
methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA,
two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced
video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos
with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content
based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents
interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models
to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these
carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided
by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video
understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm
capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well
as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1
significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of
benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and
captioning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVA-Bench是一个新的基准测试，旨在通过解耦14种原子视觉能力（AVAs）来系统评估视觉基础模型（VFMs），解决了现有VQA基准测试的数据分布不对齐和多能力混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估协议存在两个盲点：指令调优数据与VQA测试分布不匹配，以及VQA基准测试需要多种视觉能力，难以定位错误来源。

Method: 引入AVA-Bench，明确解耦14种AVAs（如定位、深度估计等），并在每种能力内匹配训练和测试分布，以精确评估VFMs。

Result: AVA-Bench揭示了VFMs的独特“能力指纹”，并发现0.5B参数的LLM与7B参数的LLM在VFM排名上表现相似，但GPU时间减少8倍。

Conclusion: AVA-Bench为下一代VFMs提供了全面透明的评估基准，使VFM选择从猜测变为有原则的工程。

Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation.
A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question
Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i)
the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning
a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual
shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities,
making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities
or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench,
the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities
(AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial
understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By
decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each,
AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench
to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM
selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find
that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours
by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and
transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next
generation of VFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅能全局控制单一主体，无法处理多概念交互场景。

Method: 利用掩码预测器自动推断布局信息，并通过迭代方式注入局部音频条件。

Result: 实验验证了显式布局控制对多模态条件的有效性。

Conclusion: 新框架实现了高质量、可控的多概念人类中心视频生成。

Abstract: End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text,
image and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However,
most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions
in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in
the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object
interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control
of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders
applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and
introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of
conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given
reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer
layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues
between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we
inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure
layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the
high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos.
Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our
explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit
counterparts and other existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模计算机视觉任务中手动标注耗时且易出错的问题。

Method: 结合可调节放大镜、交互式数据增强、标签传播和基于改进YOLOE框架的自动标注模块。

Result: BakuFlow显著提升了标注效率，适用于动态数据集和工业场景。

Conclusion: BakuFlow为计算机视觉任务提供了一种高效、灵活的标注解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer
vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is
time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the
labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each
image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic
label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for
pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive
data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation
for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly
accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module
powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension
supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class
during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic,
real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for
object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and
improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成AI模型的广泛应用引发对偏见和歧视性结果的担忧，但偏见机制尤其是无条件生成中的偏见仍未明确。

Method: 训练无条件图像生成模型，采用常用偏见评估框架分析训练与生成分布间的偏见偏移。

Result: 实验显示偏见偏移较小，但属性分类器对结果影响显著，尤其在连续属性上。

Conclusion: 需改进标签实践、深入评估框架，并考虑属性的社会复杂性以更准确评估偏见。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns
about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite
growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges -
especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the
bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence
in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference
distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative
models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift
between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the
detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are
sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the
evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in
high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier
sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as
opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more
representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through
greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex
nature of attributes when evaluating bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在多元文化背景下的公平性能需求迫切，但现有方法存在性能损失、事实错误或冒犯性输出等问题，且缺乏可靠的偏见测量工具。

Method: 提出CAIRe框架，通过将图像中的实体和概念与知识库关联，利用事实信息对每个文化标签进行独立分级评估。

Result: CAIRe在手动构建的文化显著但罕见的数据集上优于基线28% F1分数，并在两个文化通用概念数据集上与人类评分的相关性达到0.56和0.66。

Conclusion: CAIRe能有效衡量图像的文化相关性，与人类判断高度一致，适用于多样化的图像来源。

Abstract: As text-to-image models become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their
equitable performance across diverse cultural contexts is critical. Efforts to
mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a
loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite
widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure
these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, a
novel evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an
image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and
concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give
independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated
dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe
surpasses all baselines by 28% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two
datasets for culturally universal concept, one comprising of T2I-generated
outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves
Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based
on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong
alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.

in video generation, yet current foundational model still face critical
challenges in simultaneously balancing prompt following, motion plausibility,
and visual quality. In this report, we introduce Seedance 1.0, a
high-performance and inference-efficient video foundation generation model that
integrates several core technical improvements: (i) multi-source data curation
augmented with precision and meaningful video captioning, enabling
comprehensive learning across diverse scenarios; (ii) an efficient architecture
design with proposed training paradigm, which allows for natively supporting
multi-shot generation and jointly learning of both text-to-video and
image-to-video tasks. (iii) carefully-optimized post-training approaches
leveraging fine-grained supervised fine-tuning, and video-specific RLHF with
multi-dimensional reward mechanisms for comprehensive performance improvements;
(iv) excellent model acceleration achieving ~10x inference speedup through
multi-stage distillation strategies and system-level optimizations. Seedance
1.0 can generate a 5-second video at 1080p resolution only with 41.4 seconds
(NVIDIA-L20). Compared to state-of-the-art video generation models, Seedance
1.0 stands out with high-quality and fast video generation having superior
spatiotemporal fluidity with structural stability, precise instruction
adherence in complex multi-subject contexts, native multi-shot narrative
coherence with consistent subject representation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CREPA的新方法，用于改进视频扩散模型（VDMs）的微调，通过跨帧表示对齐提升视觉保真度和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户级微调VDMs以生成反映特定训练数据属性的视频具有实际重要性，但现有方法在保持帧间语义一致性方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出CREPA方法，通过将帧的隐藏状态与相邻帧的外部特征对齐，优化VDMs的微调效果。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Hunyuan Video等大规模VDMs上，CREPA显著提升了视觉质量和帧间语义一致性。

Conclusion: CREPA是一种广泛适用的正则化技术，有效解决了VDMs微调中的语义一致性问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate
videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable
challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance.
Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown
promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion
models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external
pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In
this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and
empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in
preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we
introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization
technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from
neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including
CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual
fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with
parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across
diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability.

TL;DR: PatchGuard是一种基于Vision Transformer的对抗鲁棒异常检测与定位方法，通过引入伪异常样本和定位掩码，显著提升了对抗攻击下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前异常检测与定位方法因训练数据限制（仅包含正常样本）易受对抗攻击影响，需开发更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出Foreground-Aware Pseudo-Anomalies，结合ViT架构和对抗训练，使用新损失函数增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在工业和医学数据集上，PatchGuard在对抗环境下AD性能提升53.2%，AL提升68.5%，且在非对抗环境下仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: PatchGuard通过伪异常样本和理论指导的对抗训练，显著提升了异常检测与定位的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields
that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial
monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to
adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically
include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an
adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with
localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to
address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties
of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the
attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and
AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware
Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware
methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a
ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function
designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis.
Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets
demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in
adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and
$68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial
settings. The code repository is available at

TL;DR: UFM模型通过统一训练在光流和宽基线匹配任务中表现优异，准确率提升28%，误差减少62%，速度提升6.7倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在光流估计和宽基线匹配中分离处理的问题，探索统一训练的可能性。

Method: 使用简单的通用Transformer架构，直接回归(u,v)流，避免传统的粗到细成本体积方法。

Result: UFM在光流任务中比Unimatch准确率高28%，在宽基线匹配中比RoMa误差少62%且快6.7倍。

Conclusion: 统一训练可以超越专门化方法，为多模态、长距离和实时对应任务开辟新方向。

Abstract: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual
odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification.
Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for
wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of
matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow &
Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are
co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic
transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier
to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical
coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than
state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and
6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to
demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across
both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and
opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence
tasks.

Conclusion: 量化YOLOv4-Tiny模型适合在低功耗边缘设备上实现实时应急检测。

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight and energy-efficient object detection
solution for aerial imagery captured during emergency response situations. We
focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural
network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The
model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of
10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior
works that rely on publicly available datasets, we created this dataset
ourselves due to the lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery,
making the dataset itself a key contribution of this work. The quantized model
is evaluated against YOLOv5-small across multiple metrics, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), F1 score, inference time, and model size. Experimental
results demonstrate that the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny achieves comparable
detection performance while reducing the model size from 22.5 MB to 6.4 MB and
improving inference speed by 44\%. With a 71\% reduction in model size and a
44\% increase in inference speed, the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model proves highly
suitable for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.

Abstract: Remote sensing image interpretation plays a critical role in environmental
monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, acquiring
high-quality labeled data is often costly and time-consuming. To address this
challenge, we proposes a multi-modal self-supervised learning framework that
leverages high-resolution RGB images, multi-spectral data, and digital surface
models (DSM) for pre-training. By designing an information-aware adaptive
masking strategy, cross-modal masking mechanism, and multi-task self-supervised
objectives, the framework effectively captures both the correlations across
different modalities and the unique feature structures within each modality. We
evaluated the proposed method on multiple downstream tasks, covering typical
remote sensing applications such as scene classification, semantic
segmentation, change detection, object detection, and depth estimation.
Experiments are conducted on 15 remote sensing datasets, encompassing 26 tasks.
The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
pretraining approaches in most tasks. Specifically, on the Potsdam and
Vaihingen semantic segmentation tasks, our method achieved mIoU scores of
78.30\% and 76.50\%, with only 50\% train-set. For the US3D depth estimation
task, the RMSE error is reduced to 0.182, and for the binary change detection
task in SECOND dataset, our method achieved mIoU scores of 47.51\%, surpassing
the second CS-MAE by 3 percentage points. Our pretrain code, checkpoints, and
HR-Pairs dataset can be found in https://github.com/CVEO/MSSDF.

Abstract: Correct use of electrical appliances has significantly improved human life
quality. Unlike simple tools that can be manipulated with common sense,
different parts of electrical appliances have specific functions defined by
manufacturers. If we want the robot to heat bread by microwave, we should
enable them to review the microwave manual first. From the manual, it can learn
about component functions, interaction methods, and representative task steps
about appliances. However, previous manual-related works remain limited to
question-answering tasks while existing manipulation researchers ignore the
manual's important role and fail to comprehend multi-page manuals. In this
paper, we propose the first manual-based appliance manipulation benchmark
CheckManual. Specifically, we design a large model-assisted human-revised data
generation pipeline to create manuals based on CAD appliance models. With these
manuals, we establish novel manual-based manipulation challenges, metrics, and
simulator environments for model performance evaluation. Furthermore, we
propose the first manual-based manipulation planning model ManualPlan to set up
a group of baselines for the CheckManual benchmark.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal tasks have strongly advanced the field of action
recognition with their rich multimodal information. However, due to the
scarcity of tri-modal data, research on tri-modal action recognition tasks
faces many challenges. To this end, we have proposed a comprehensive multimodal
action recognition solution that effectively utilizes multimodal information.
First, the existing data are transformed and expanded by optimizing data
enhancement techniques to enlarge the training scale. At the same time, more
RGB datasets are used to pre-train the backbone network, which is better
adapted to the new task by means of transfer learning. Secondly, multimodal
spatial features are extracted with the help of 2D CNNs and combined with the
Temporal Shift Module (TSM) to achieve multimodal spatial-temporal feature
extraction comparable to 3D CNNs and improve the computational efficiency. In
addition, common prediction enhancement methods, such as Stochastic Weight
Averaging (SWA), Ensemble and Test-Time augmentation (TTA), are used to
integrate the knowledge of models from different training periods of the same
architecture and different architectures, so as to predict the actions from
different perspectives and fully exploit the target information. Ultimately, we
achieved the Top-1 accuracy of 99% and the Top-5 accuracy of 100% on the
competition leaderboard, demonstrating the superiority of our solution.

Conclusion: AAPT方法通过对抗训练和高效架构设计，显著提升了视频生成的实时性和交互能力。

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive,
preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we
propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a
pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video
generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using
a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to
the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate
the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores
adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.
This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for
one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables
training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in
reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments
demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video
generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to
a minute long (1440 frames). Visit our research website at

Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision aimed at
delineating object boundaries within images. Traditional approaches, such as
edge detection and variational methods, have been widely explored, while recent
advances in deep learning have shown promising results but often require
extensive training data. In this work, we propose a novel variational framework
for 2D image segmentation that integrates concepts from shape analysis and
diffeomorphic transformations. Our method models segmentation as the
deformation of a template curve via a diffeomorphic transformation of the image
domain, using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)
framework. The curve evolution is guided by a loss function that compares the
deformed curve to the image gradient field, formulated through the varifold
representation of geometric shapes. The approach is implemented in Python with
GPU acceleration using the PyKeops library. This framework allows for accurate
segmentation with a flexible and theoretically grounded methodology that does
not rely on large datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image
generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during
pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and
copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn
undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However,
existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it,
trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized
concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment
erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by
the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns
the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial
relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional
preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of
irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the
global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic
relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively
expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our
method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive
superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of Line Segment Detection (LSD) for the
characterization of line geometry in images, with the aim of learning a
domain-agnostic robust LSD model that works well for any natural images. With
the focus of scalable self-supervised learning of LSD, we revisit and
streamline the fundamental designs of (deep and non-deep) LSD approaches to
have a high-performing and efficient LSD learner, dubbed as ScaleLSD, for the
curation of line geometry at scale from over 10M unlabeled real-world images.
Our ScaleLSD works very well to detect much more number of line segments from
any natural images even than the pioneered non-deep LSD approach, having a more
complete and accurate geometric characterization of images using line segments.
Experimentally, our proposed ScaleLSD is comprehensively testified under
zero-shot protocols in detection performance, single-view 3D geometry
estimation, two-view line segment matching, and multiview 3D line mapping, all
with excellent performance obtained. Based on the thorough evaluation, our
ScaleLSD is observed to be the first deep approach that outperforms the
pioneered non-deep LSD in all aspects we have tested, significantly expanding
and reinforcing the versatility of the line geometry of images. Code and Models

Conclusion: UniForward在3D场景与语义场统一重建中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that unifies 3D scene and
semantic field reconstruction. Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields
facilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment.
However, key challenges include embedding semantics into 3D representations,
achieving generalizable real-time reconstruction, and ensuring practical
applicability by using only images as input without camera parameters or ground
truth depth. To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to
predict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated
and unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D
scene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and
predict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we
propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard,
eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous
methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained
end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages
semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage,
our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields
in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve
high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the
rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can
be further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner.
Experiments on novel view synthesis and novel view segmentation demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances for unifying 3D scene
and semantic field reconstruction.

Abstract: In real-word scenarios, person re-identification (ReID) expects to identify a
person-of-interest via the descriptive query, regardless of whether the query
is a single modality or a combination of multiple modalities. However, existing
methods and datasets remain constrained to limited modalities, failing to meet

Omni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve
effective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries. To address dataset
scarcity, we construct ORBench, the first high-quality multi-modal dataset
comprising 1,000 unique identities across five modalities: RGB, infrared, color
pencil, sketch, and textual description. This dataset also has significant
superiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and
textual information. It could serve as an ideal platform for follow-up
investigations in OM-ReID. Moreover, we propose ReID5o, a novel multi-modal
learning framework for person ReID. It enables synergistic fusion and
cross-modal alignment of arbitrary modality combinations in a single model,
with a unified encoding and multi-expert routing mechanism proposed. Extensive
experiments verify the advancement and practicality of our ORBench. A wide
range of possible models have been evaluated and compared on it, and our
proposed ReID5o model gives the best performance. The dataset and code will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/Zplusdragon/ReID5o_ORBench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态调整先验几何的方法，通过实时更新协方差矩阵改进OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子空间的方法因静态提取信息几何而无法处理分布不良样本导致的几何扭曲。

Method: 动态更新先验协方差矩阵，沿实时输入特征方向减少协方差，并在残差空间约束调整。

Result: 在CIFAR和ImageNet-1k数据集上显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 动态调整先验几何能有效纠正分布不良样本的影响，提升OOD检测效果。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the trustworthiness of
AI systems. Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have
shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD
data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to
address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the
limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training
distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed
samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in
response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that
dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,
refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the
direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual
space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on
unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two
pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for
ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across
various models. The code is released at https://github.com/workerbcd/ooddcc.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Segment Anything Model（SAM）的源自由域适应方法（SRPL-SFDA），通过增强伪标签质量和可靠性，显著提升了医学图像分割在目标域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决源自由域适应（SFDA）中目标域无标签数据监督不足的问题，同时应对隐私和数据访问限制的挑战。

Method: 1）测试时三分支强度增强（T3IE）提升伪标签质量；2）基于多SAM输出一致性（CMSO）的可靠伪标签选择模块；3）可靠性感知训练，结合熵最小化。

Result: 在两个医学图像分割数据集上，SRPL-SFDA性能优于现有SFDA方法，接近目标域有监督训练的效果。

Conclusion: SRPL-SFDA通过SAM引导的可靠伪标签方法，有效提升了SFDA的性能，为医学图像分割的域适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) is crucial for robust deployment of medical image
segmentation models when applied to new clinical centers with significant
domain shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal
with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during
adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as
insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this
work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels
method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch
Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw
pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs
with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for
refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that
rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs
(CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training
procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used
for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization.
Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets
for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA
effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and
improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2)
SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is
close to that of supervised training in the target domain. The code of this
work is available online: https://github.com/HiLab-git/SRPL-SFDA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在人类动作视频理解任务中常因不自然特征而效果受限，影响了其在手势识别、自动驾驶等领域的应用潜力。

Method: 使用可控3D高斯虚拟人模型进行姿态迁移，生成合成人类动作视频数据。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了合成数据的实用性，还开源了相关数据集和工具，为后续研究提供了支持。

Abstract: In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion,
synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its
effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture
recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus
been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper
proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose
transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate
this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it
improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups
underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We
open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and
avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the
internet.

Motivation: 探索如何高效地将扩散模型蒸馏为生成去噪器，同时保留快速生成和高质量样本的能力。

Method: 将无条件评分函数的洞察整合到VSD框架中，学习能够近似不同噪声水平下后验分布的生成去噪器。

Conclusion: NCVSD通过灵活的测试时计算扩展，实现了快速生成与高质量样本的平衡，并在逆问题中创下LPIPS记录。

Abstract: We propose Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation (NCVSD), a novel
method for distilling pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers. We
achieve this by revealing that the unconditional score function implicitly
characterizes the score function of denoising posterior distributions. By
integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD)
framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of
approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide
range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable
properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative
refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian
noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the
test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic
inference for flexible and controllable sampling. We evaluate NCVSD through
extensive experiments, including class-conditional image generation and inverse
problem solving. By scaling the test-time compute, our method outperforms
teacher diffusion models and is on par with consistency models of larger sizes.
Additionally, with significantly fewer NFEs than diffusion-based methods, we
achieve record-breaking LPIPS on inverse problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D占用预测方法在计算成本、小物体信息丢失或平坦表面建模效率上存在不足，需要一种更高效且全面的解决方案。

Method: 采用双分支设计：基于查询的稀疏点分支和BEV分支，通过交叉注意力共享信息，最终融合输出预测的3D占用。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和Occ3D-Waymo基准测试中表现优越，同时推理速度与最新高效方法相当。

Conclusion: ODG结合了BEV和稀疏点的优势，显著提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, ODG, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ODG. Moreover, ODG
also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest efficient
approaches.

Conclusion: InterSyn和SynJudge为多模态系统的进步提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly
improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still
struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to
the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training
datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal
dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR)
method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly
interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous
automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training
next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of
reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs,
we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively
assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content,
image quality, and image-text synergy.
  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher
dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.
  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across
all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal
systems.

Conclusion: 轻量级架构和边缘感知策略有效提升了遥感图像描述的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved strong performance in remote sensing
image captioning by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual
information. However, their practical deployment is hindered by high
computational costs, especially in multi-modal frameworks that employ separate
transformer-based encoders and decoders. In addition, existing remote sensing
image captioning models primarily focus on high-level semantic extraction while
often overlooking fine-grained structural features such as edges, contours, and
object boundaries. To address these challenges, a lightweight transformer
architecture is proposed by reducing the dimensionality of the encoder layers
and employing a distilled version of GPT-2 as the decoder. A knowledge
distillation strategy is used to transfer knowledge from a more complex teacher
model to improve the performance of the lightweight network. Furthermore, an
edge-aware enhancement strategy is incorporated to enhance image representation
and object boundary understanding, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
spatial details in remote sensing images. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves caption quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal
grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given
a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the
start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for
Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune
TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a
weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not
available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the
validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the
question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question
referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the
answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well
as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For
grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate
weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider
the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.

Conclusion: HAM通过协调和合并源模型，显著提升了领域泛化能力。

Abstract: CLIP-based domain generalization aims to improve model generalization to
unseen domains by leveraging the powerful zero-shot classification capabilities
of CLIP and multiple source datasets. Existing methods typically train a single
model across multiple source domains to capture domain-shared information.
However, this paradigm inherently suffers from two types of conflicts: 1)
sample conflicts, arising from noisy samples and extreme domain shifts among
sources; and 2) optimization conflicts, stemming from competition and
trade-offs during multi-source training. Both hinder the generalization and
lead to suboptimal solutions. Recent studies have shown that model merging can
effectively mitigate the competition of multi-objective optimization and
improve generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose
Harmonizing and Merging (HAM), a novel source model merging framework for
CLIP-based domain generalization. During the training process of the source
models, HAM enriches the source samples without conflicting samples, and
harmonizes the update directions of all models. Then, a redundancy-aware
historical model merging method is introduced to effectively integrate
knowledge across all source models. HAM comprehensively consolidates source
domain information while enabling mutual enhancement among source models,
ultimately yielding a final model with optimal generalization capabilities.
Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了开放集域泛化问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Open-set domain generalization(OSDG) for hyperspectral image classification
presents significant challenges due to the presence of unknown classes in
target domains and the need for models to generalize across multiple unseen
domains without target-specific adaptation. Existing domain adaptation methods
assume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the
fundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to
negative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that
combines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement
(SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network
(DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning
(EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty
Disentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module
extracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through
attention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while
DCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel
pathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation
using Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable
open-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive
rejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral
classification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the
target domain during training. The implementation will be made available at
https://github.com/amir-khb/SSUDOSDG upon acceptance.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding,
aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from
a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person
activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In
this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in
multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person
for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action
Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137
fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions
for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133
using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor
aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a
holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF,
leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance
holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to
introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation
generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse
evaluation settings. The code is available at

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving
systems, as it lays the foundations for advanced perception and precise path
planning modules. Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing
surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration
of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the
environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking
objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware
optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles.
By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding
boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to
smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In
that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent
detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two
stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive
evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset,
where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks,
including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various
testing sequences.

Abstract: Absolute localization, aiming to determine an agent's location with respect
to a global reference, is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
various applications, but it becomes challenging when global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based absolute
localization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference
satellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied
scenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level
image matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences
introduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome
these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source
image matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates
a semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a
lightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching
module, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first
establish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural
constraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine
features and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV
absolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on
relative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module
before the proposed hierarchical image matching modules. Experimental
evaluations on public benchmark datasets and a newly introduced CS-UAV dataset
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under
various challenging conditions, confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), a predominant trend in instruction learning, aims
at enhancing the performance of large language models by providing clear task
guidance and examples, improving their capability in task understanding and
execution. This paper investigates ICL on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
and explores the policies of multi-modal demonstration selection. Existing
research efforts in ICL face significant challenges: First, they rely on
pre-defined demonstrations or heuristic selecting strategies based on human
intuition, which are usually inadequate for covering diverse task requirements,
leading to sub-optimal solutions; Second, individually selecting each
demonstration fails in modeling the interactions between them, resulting in
information redundancy. Unlike these prevailing efforts, we propose a new
exploration-exploitation reinforcement learning framework, which explores
policies to fuse multi-modal information and adaptively select adequate
demonstrations as an integrated whole. The framework allows LVLMs to optimize
themselves by continually refining their demonstrations through
self-exploration, enabling the ability to autonomously identify and generate
the most effective selection policies for in-context learning. Experimental
results verify the superior performance of our approach on four Visual
Question-Answering (VQA) datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing

Motivation: 现有导航研究分散于不同任务/能力（如ObjNav、ImgNav和VLN），缺乏通用性。本文旨在开发能处理多模态和多能力自由指令的通用导航代理。

Method: 提出OctoNav-Bench基准和TBA-CoT数据集，构建基于MLLMs的OctoNav-R1模型，采用混合训练范式（HTP）分三阶段训练：Action-/TBA-SFT、Nav-GPRO和Online RL。

Result: OctoNav-R1在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过TBA-CoT数据集和HTP训练范式，实现了通用导航代理的推理能力提升，为多模态导航研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit
of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different
tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task
objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed
individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,
which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of
multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale
benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.
Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed
via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory
pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and
capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within
OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,
we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce
low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a
Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,
Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains
specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT
and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which
show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to
investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation
field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically,
we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a
cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.
Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Urban1960SatBench数据集和Urban1960SatUSM框架，用于解决历史卫星图像的语义分割问题，填补了早期城市发展研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史卫星图像（如20世纪中叶的Keyhole数据）因质量退化（失真、错位、光谱稀缺）和缺乏标注，难以进行语义分割。研究旨在通过新数据集和框架提升对城市发展的理解。

Method: 1. 构建Urban1960SatBench数据集，覆盖1240平方公里，标注关键城市类别；2. 提出Urban1960SatUSM框架，采用置信对齐机制和焦点置信损失，实现无监督分割。

Result: Urban1960SatUSM在历史城市场景分割中显著优于现有无监督方法，为长期城市变化的定量研究提供了可能。

Conclusion: Urban1960SatBench和Urban1960SatUSM为历史卫星图像的语义分割提供了新工具，推动了城市发展研究的进展。

Abstract: Historical satellite imagery, such as mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole data,
offers rare insights into understanding early urban development and long-term
transformation. However, severe quality degradation (e.g., distortion,
misalignment, and spectral scarcity) and annotation absence have long hindered
semantic segmentation on such historical RS imagery. To bridge this gap and
enhance understanding of urban development, we introduce
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$, an annotated segmentation dataset based on
historical satellite imagery with the earliest observation time among all
existing segmentation datasets, along with a benchmark framework for
unsupervised segmentation tasks, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$. First,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$ serves as a novel, expertly annotated semantic
segmentation dataset built on mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole imagery, covering
1,240 km$^2$ and key urban classes (buildings, roads, farmland, water). As the
earliest segmentation dataset of its kind, it provides a pioneering benchmark
for historical urban understanding. Second,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$(Unsupervised Segmentation Model) is a novel
unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for historical RS imagery. It
employs a confidence-aware alignment mechanism and focal-confidence loss based
on a self-supervised learning architecture, which generates robust
pseudo-labels and adaptively prioritizes prediction difficulty and label
reliability to improve unsupervised segmentation on noisy historical data
without manual supervision. Experiments show Urban1960SatUSM significantly
outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods on Urban1960SatSeg for
segmenting historical urban scenes, promising in paving the way for
quantitative studies of long-term urban change using modern computer vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型仅基于真实世界的安全专家轨迹数据，难以模拟罕见但重要的危险或非专家行为，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 通过整合真实人类驾驶数据和模拟器（如CARLA）收集的非专家数据，构建了一个可控世界模型，并采用扩散变换器架构的视频生成器，结合多种策略提高预测可控性和保真度。

Result: 提出的ReSim模型在视觉保真度上提高了44%，对专家和非专家行为的可控性提升超过50%，并在NAVSIM上分别提高了规划和策略选择性能2%和25%。

Conclusion: ReSim方法通过结合真实和模拟数据，显著提升了驾驶场景模拟的多样性和可靠性，为政策评估等任务提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: How can we reliably simulate future driving scenarios under a wide range of
ego driving behaviors? Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on
real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle
to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This
limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In
this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human
demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator
(e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this
heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion
transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate
conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The
resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world
driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones.
To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require
reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module
that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm
achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both
expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy
selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.

TL;DR: TinySplat提出了一种无需训练的压缩框架，通过消除几何、感知和空间冗余，显著减少了3D高斯数据的存储成本，同时保持高质量和高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯重建方法虽然速度快，但存储成本高，且传统压缩方法因架构不兼容无法适用。

Method: TinySplat结合了View-Projection Transformation（VPT）减少几何冗余，Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction（VABR）减少感知冗余，以及视频编解码器减少空间冗余。

Result: 实验表明，TinySplat实现了100倍以上的压缩比，存储大小仅为现有方法的6%，编码时间减少75%，解码时间减少99%。

Conclusion: TinySplat为3D高斯数据提供了一种高效、高质量的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: The recent development of feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents a
new paradigm to reconstruct 3D scenes. Using neural networks trained on
large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations
from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high
reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D
Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization
are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for
generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward
3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that
systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce
View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by
projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present
Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy
by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis
transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an
off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression
for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the
state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only
6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25%
of the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合自回归Transformer和扩散模型的优势，提升图像生成的质量和效率。

Method: TransDiff通过联合建模框架编码标签和图像语义特征，利用扩散模型估计图像样本分布，并引入MRAR实现多参考生成。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，FID为1.61，IS为293.4，推理速度显著优于现有方法；MRAR进一步将FID降至1.42。

Conclusion: TransDiff为图像生成领域开辟了新方向，结合MRAR进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries
Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling
framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic
features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image
samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms
other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion
models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID)
of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster
inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer
and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore,
building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm
called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive
generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference
multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more
diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in
subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is
improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open
up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

Motivation: 当前方法中熵参数估计未充分利用信息，且固定似然区间限制了模型性能。

Method: 引入广义高斯熵模型控制尾部形状，并提出MED动态调整似然区间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了三种VAE模型的率失真性能，并适用于其他压缩任务。

Conclusion: 广义高斯熵模型和MED方法有效提升了压缩性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Gaussian and Laplacian entropy models are proved effective in learned point
cloud attribute compression, as they assist in arithmetic coding of latents.
However, we demonstrate through experiments that there is still unutilized
information in entropy parameters estimated by neural networks in current
methods, which can be used for more accurate probability estimation. Thus we
introduce generalized Gaussian entropy model, which controls the tail shape
through shape parameter to more accurately estimate the probability of latents.
Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, existing methods use fixed likelihood
intervals for each integer during arithmetic coding, which limits model
performance. We propose Mean Error Discriminator (MED) to determine whether the
entropy parameter estimation is accurate and then dynamically adjust likelihood
intervals. Experiments show that our method significantly improves
rate-distortion (RD) performance on three VAE-based models for point cloud
attribute compression, and our method can be applied to other compression
tasks, such as image and video compression.

Motivation: 单目视频动态3D场景重建是3D视觉的基础挑战，现有3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）方法在动态场景中存在冗余更新、运动监督不足和非刚性变形建模弱的问题。

Method: HAIF-GS通过锚点过滤器识别运动相关区域，利用自监督流引导变形模块和多级锚点传播机制实现高效动态建模。

Result: 实验表明，HAIF-GS在渲染质量、时间一致性和重建效率上显著优于现有动态3DGS方法。

Conclusion: HAIF-GS为动态3D场景重建提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos remains a fundamental
challenge in 3D vision. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time
rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due
to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion
representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in
existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision,
and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively
hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these
limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured
and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It
first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses
redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided
Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation,
eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained
deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor
resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level
transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in
rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.

Motivation: 传统解码策略未能充分利用视觉信息，导致视觉无关的响应。现有方法通常需要额外训练或多步推理，ReVisiT旨在以低计算成本解决这一问题。

Method: ReVisiT通过将视觉标记投影到文本标记分布空间，并动态选择最相关的视觉标记来优化输出分布，从而更好地融入视觉语义。

Result: 在三个LVLM幻觉基准测试中，ReVisiT显著提升了视觉相关性，计算成本降低至2倍。

Conclusion: ReVisiT在提升视觉相关性的同时，以较低计算成本实现了与现有最佳方法相当或更优的结果。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language
understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to
successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded
responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this
limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference
procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a
simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the
text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic
information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text
token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision
token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This
selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better
incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination
benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances
visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method
achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines
while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.

Motivation: 传统3D高斯分布渲染技术存在大量冗余高斯基元，占用过多内存和渲染资源，现有压缩方法缺乏全局保真度保证。

Method: 通过最优传输视角将3D高斯分布压缩建模为全局高斯混合缩减，利用KD树分区最小化复合传输散度，并解耦几何与外观属性进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需10%的高斯基元即可实现与原始方法相当的渲染质量（PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS），且优于现有压缩技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为轻量级神经渲染提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于任何3D高斯分布渲染流程。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for radiance
field rendering, but it typically requires millions of redundant Gaussian
primitives, overwhelming memory and rendering budgets. Existing compaction
approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance
scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a
novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global
Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite
transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric
representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color
and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering
quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians;
and (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques.
Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS
pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural
rendering.

Conclusion: 本研究深化了对物理视角鲁棒性补丁的理解，揭示了文本概念与T2I生成内容物理属性之间的关系。

Abstract: Cutting-edge works have demonstrated that text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models can generate adversarial patches that mislead state-of-the-art object
detectors in the physical world, revealing detectors' vulnerabilities and
risks. However, these methods neglect the T2I patches' attack effectiveness
when observed from different views in the physical world (i.e., angle
robustness of the T2I adversarial patches). In this paper, we study the angle
robustness of T2I adversarial patches comprehensively, revealing their
angle-robust issues, demonstrating that texts affect the angle robustness of
generated patches significantly, and task-specific linguistic instructions fail
to enhance the angle robustness. Motivated by the studies, we introduce
Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL), a simple and flexible approach that
learns a generalizable concept (i.e., text embeddings in implementation)
representing the capability of generating angle-robust patches. The learned
concept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to
generate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to
viewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world
experiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that
AngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial
patches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success
rates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative
improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research
advances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides
insights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties
in T2I-generated contents.

Conclusion: 3DGeoDet通过几何表示显著提升性能，适用于多种环境和视角。

Abstract: This paper proposes 3DGeoDet, a novel geometry-aware 3D object detection
approach that effectively handles single- and multi-view RGB images in indoor
and outdoor environments, showcasing its general-purpose applicability. The key
challenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric
cues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images
and 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D
geometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on
predicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to
learn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly
through the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D
awareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation,
the truncated signed distance function (TSDF). Without requiring supervision
from 3D signals, we significantly improve the model's comprehension of 3D
geometry by leveraging intermediate 3D representations and achieve end-to-end
training. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art
image-based methods on both single- and multi-view benchmark datasets across
diverse environments, achieving a 9.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the SUN RGB-D
dataset, a 3.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the ScanNetV2 dataset, and a 0.19

Conclusion: AD^2-Bench为自动驾驶中的MLLMs推理提供了标准化评测平台，推动了研究进展。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal
Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with
adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing
benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT
processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical
gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically
designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes.
AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria:
comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained
annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation
framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of
AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually
annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations
is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented
fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level,
point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting
the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable
end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized
evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in
autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.

Abstract: Holistic 3D scene understanding, which jointly models geometry, appearance,
and semantics, is crucial for applications like augmented reality and robotic
interaction. Existing feed-forward 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., LSM)
are limited to extracting language-based semantics from scenes, failing to
achieve holistic scene comprehension. Additionally, they suffer from
low-quality geometry reconstruction and noisy artifacts. In contrast, per-scene
optimization methods rely on dense input views, which reduces practicality and
increases complexity during deployment. In this paper, we propose
SemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which
unifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint
geometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic
Gaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a
cost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities,
enhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage
distillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal
semantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable
and open-vocabulary segmentation. Video results are available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成连贯且一致的视觉故事方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉故事生成提供了一种高效且无需训练的一致性增强方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing
high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle
with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental
requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this
by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which
is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share
information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this
paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag
Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject
consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling
mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject
characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across
generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based
on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and
consistent visual stories. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法常忽略环境影响，导致碰撞问题，需改进环境避障能力。

Result: 在ETH/UCY数据集上验证，碰撞率降低40-50%。

Conclusion: ECAM有效提升轨迹预测的环境避障能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting is crucial in applications such as autonomous
driving, robotics and surveillance. Accurate forecasting requires models to
consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal
predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing
methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the
environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces
ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based
module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The
proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models,
improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our
method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate
its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when
integrated with the proposed module. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型主要针对2D医学图像，难以捕捉复杂3D解剖结构，导致误诊和诊断幻觉。

Method: HSENet采用双3D视觉编码器感知全局和细节信息，并结合空间打包器压缩高分辨率3D区域为视觉标记。

Result: 在3D语言-视觉检索、医学报告生成和视觉问答任务中，HSENet均取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: HSENet通过高效视觉感知和投影，显著提升了3D医学图像与语言理解的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based
decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in
visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical
images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D
anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of
subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we
present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits
enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection
for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet
employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and
fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment
with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient
multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a
compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By
assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly
perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space,
facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report
generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering
(73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GAN导致的训练不稳定问题，并优化高压缩比下的性能退化，同时最小化潜在空间维度。

Method: 提出DGAE，利用扩散模型引导解码器恢复潜在表示中未完全解码的信息信号。

Result: DGAE在高空间压缩率下有效缓解性能退化，潜在空间缩小2倍，与扩散模型结合在ImageNet-1K图像生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: DGAE通过改进解码器表达力，实现了更高效的潜在表示，并加速扩散模型的收敛。

Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by
compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although
recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders
under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by
GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim
to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and
compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the
decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a
diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are
not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE
effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial
compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance
with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE
demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and
shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of
the diffusion model.

Conclusion: DeGSS为多部件物体提供了一种紧凑且连续的表示，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in everyday life, and accurate 3D
representations of their geometry and motion are critical for numerous
applications. However, in the absence of human annotation, existing approaches
still struggle to build a unified representation for objects that contain
multiple movable parts. We introduce DeGSS, a unified framework that encodes
articulated objects as deformable 3D Gaussian fields, embedding geometry,
appearance, and motion in one compact representation. Each interaction state is
modeled as a smooth deformation of a shared field, and the resulting
deformation trajectories guide a progressive coarse-to-fine part segmentation
that identifies distinct rigid components, all in an unsupervised manner. The
refined field provides a spatially continuous, fully decoupled description of
every part, supporting part-level reconstruction and precise modeling of their
kinematic relationships. To evaluate generalization and realism, we enlarge the
synthetic PartNet-Mobility benchmark and release RS-Art, a real-to-sim dataset
that pairs RGB captures with accurately reverse-engineered 3D models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: CINeMA为脑研究提供了强大工具，代码和图谱已开源。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid
neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within
days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore,
requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and
temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and
recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive
datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of
pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with
CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for
creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable
for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent
space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas
construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible
conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies
like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA
supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction
whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and
anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for
advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric models promise improved robustness
through mechanisms such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling.
However, their ability to withstand misleading user input remains
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of three
state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet
and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and
CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average)
following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning
models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback.
Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this
vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend
their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and
curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks,
GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops
exceeding 53% on average. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in the
robustness of reasoning models, highlighting the gap between step-by-step
reasoning and belief persistence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在推理时通过结构化图像和文本来提升视觉语言模型（VLM）组合性的方法，无需额外训练即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双编码器视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在组合性任务上表现不佳，推理时技术研究较少。

Method: 在推理时，将图像分割为小块，提取文本片段（对象、属性和关系），利用VLM匹配图像块与文本片段，并聚合相似度得分。

Result: 方法在多个数据集上显著提升了VLM的组合性性能，尤其在属性-对象绑定任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 推理时结构化处理图像和文本是提升组合性的有效方法，未来可进一步优化推理时技术。

Abstract: Dual encoder Vision-Language Models (VLM) such as CLIP are widely used for
image-text retrieval tasks. However, those models struggle with
compositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their
retrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to
improve the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In
comparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this
paper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image
and a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we
extract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using
a VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining
matches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the
individual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder
VLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL
compositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the
performance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential
of inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for
attribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an
extensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually
essential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific
areas to further improve inference-time approaches.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the
high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods
offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational
demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained
settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are
inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural
degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and
low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak
expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in
complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a
hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons
with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design
enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic
accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves
competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability,
supporting its potential for practical AD screening. Our source code is

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is
essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall
short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial
conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings,
while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups
with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm
in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs
captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique
challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe
occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811
RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the
robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP
using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across
different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show
substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by
the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring
of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional
health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring,
its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing
routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient
lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic
facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term
Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240
synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across
five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration,

video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological
monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate
estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance
across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously. Dataset and code are

Abstract: Cell instance segmentation is critical to analyzing biomedical images, yet
accurately distinguishing tightly touching cells remains a persistent
challenge. Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including
detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have
made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational
efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell
instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By
conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a
four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct
labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained
semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially
simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training
instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an
asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method. Extensive
experiments on various modes demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/FCIS.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER), a critical subfield of affective
computing, presents greater challenges than macro-expression recognition due to
its brief duration and low intensity. While incorporating prior knowledge has
been shown to enhance MER performance, existing methods predominantly rely on
simplistic, singular sources of prior knowledge, failing to fully exploit
multi-source information. This paper introduces the Multi-Prior Fusion Network
(MPFNet), leveraging a progressive training strategy to optimize MER tasks. We
propose two complementary encoders: the Generic Feature Encoder (GFE) and the
Advanced Feature Encoder (AFE), both based on Inflated 3D ConvNets (I3D) with
Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanisms, to improve the model's ability to capture
spatiotemporal and channel-specific features. Inspired by developmental
psychology, we present two variants of MPFNet--MPFNet-P and
MPFNet-C--corresponding to two fundamental modes of infant cognitive
development: parallel and hierarchical processing. These variants enable the
evaluation of different strategies for integrating prior knowledge. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MPFNet significantly improves MER accuracy while
maintaining balanced performance across categories, achieving accuracies of
0.811, 0.924, and 0.857 on the SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM datasets, respectively.
To the best of our knowledge, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SMIC and SAMM datasets.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet
revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when
provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance
than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may
generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them
during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation
framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic
modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three
targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup,
and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training
pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across
multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical
reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through
algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among
open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual
perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the
effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each
perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual
reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in
multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法假设扩散模型中文本与图像完美对齐，但实际并非如此，因此需要评估和校准对齐问题。

Method: 使用零样本参考图像分割作为代理任务，分析像素-文本不对齐问题，并提出基于ELBO的校准方法ELBO-T2IAlign。

Conclusion: ELBO-T2IAlign是一种无需训练且通用的方法，能有效校准扩散模型中的像素-文本对齐问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that
these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image
alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This
information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation,
text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current
methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in
diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using
zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the
pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models.
We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models
from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in
images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we
propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text
alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of
likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to
identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various
diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark
datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness
of our proposed calibration approach.

Motivation: 现实应用中，多模态数据的类别分布不一致，现有方法假设模态共享相同类别集，导致模型无法有效利用跨模态信息识别所有类别。

Method: CSCF将模态特征对齐到共享语义空间，通过不确定性估计选择最具判别性的模态进行决策融合，并基于类别相似性整合跨模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，CSCF在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，有效解决了MMHCL任务。

Conclusion: CSCF通过跨模态知识迁移和类别相似性融合，成功解决了多模态异构类别集学习问题。

Abstract: Existing multimodal methods typically assume that different modalities share
the same category set. However, in real-world applications, the category
distributions in multimodal data exhibit inconsistencies, which can hinder the
model's ability to effectively utilize cross-modal information for recognizing
all categories. In this work, we propose the practical setting termed
Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Category-set Learning (MMHCL), where models are
trained in heterogeneous category sets of multi-modal data and aim to recognize
complete classes set of all modalities during test. To effectively address this
task, we propose a Class Similarity-based Cross-modal Fusion model (CSCF).
Specifically, CSCF aligns modality-specific features to a shared semantic space
to enable knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes. It then selects
the most discriminative modality for decision fusion through uncertainty
estimation. Finally, it integrates cross-modal information based on class
similarity, where the auxiliary modality refines the prediction of the dominant
one. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple benchmark datasets,
effectively addressing the MMHCL task.

TL;DR: Q-SAM2是一种针对SAM2的低比特量化方法，通过线性层校准和量化感知训练提升效率，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2的计算和内存消耗高，限制了其在资源受限场景中的应用。

Method: 提出线性层校准方法和量化感知训练流程，优化权重分布并抑制异常值。

Result: Q-SAM2在超低2比特量化下表现优异，比未校准模型提升66% mIoU。

Conclusion: Q-SAM2显著提升了SAM2的效率，同时保持了高精度，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a
foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its
expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its
application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an
accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To
address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and
activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel
technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method
for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a
small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization.
We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies
clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization
thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving
efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses
existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for
ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training,
our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training
quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over
non-calibrated models.

Motivation: 解决现有方法需要大量任务特定训练数据的问题，探索是否可以通过预训练模型实现高效且准确的6D姿态估计。

Method: 提出稀疏特征提取策略、特征感知评分机制和模块化设计，支持实例分割模型集成。

Result: 在BOP Benchmark的七个核心数据集上达到新SOTA，速度提升8倍，精度提高5%。

Conclusion: FreeZeV2证明了无需任务特定训练即可实现高效准确的6D姿态估计，并在BOP Challenge 2024中获最佳方法奖。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in
computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key
challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen
during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training
on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial
computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for
accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we
introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method
that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric
and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves
both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a
sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation
without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that
improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final
ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles
of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks
errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark,
where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen
objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable
8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using
ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy
while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall
Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.

Conclusion: 通过3D-MeshPref和RewardCS，DreamCS有效解决了2D偏好偏差问题，提升了3D生成质量。

Abstract: While text-to-3D generation has attracted growing interest, existing methods
often struggle to produce 3D assets that align well with human preferences.
Current preference alignment techniques for 3D content typically rely on
hardly-collected preference-paired multi-view 2D images to train 2D reward
models, when then guide 3D generation -- leading to geometric artifacts due to
their inherent 2D bias. To address these limitations, we construct 3D-MeshPref,
the first large-scale unpaired 3D preference dataset, featuring diverse 3D
meshes annotated by a large language model and refined by human evaluators. We
then develop RewardCS, the first reward model trained directly on unpaired
3D-MeshPref data using a novel Cauchy-Schwarz divergence objective, enabling
effective learning of human-aligned 3D geometric preferences without requiring
paired comparisons. Building on this, we propose DreamCS, a unified framework
that integrates RewardCS into text-to-3D pipelines -- enhancing both implicit
and explicit 3D generation with human preference feedback. Extensive
experiments show DreamCS outperforms prior methods, producing 3D assets that
are both geometrically faithful and human-preferred. Code and models will be
released publicly.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an
individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable
interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare,
criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME
research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional
information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME
recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs.
Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual
features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion
framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study
introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables
synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system
signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming
the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841
macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS,
establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and
conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the
dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating
that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting
performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME
dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data
support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the
visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME
research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset
will be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

Result: 在复杂数据集上表现优于现有方法，提供更准确、真实、紧凑且高效的动态场景重建。

Conclusion: DynaSplat为动态场景重建提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central
ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the
complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that
extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static
separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements
as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics
and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus
precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion
modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and
fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate,
non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to
ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and
perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that
DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and
realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个数据集和架构上提升了模型的泛化能力和性能。

Conclusion: 通过字符分布对齐，无需重新训练即可提升现有模型，代码已开源。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into
machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and
context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and
character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions,
often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on
specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that
incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency
distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically
derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected
distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under
temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference
time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a
guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and
architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting
generalization and performance. We open source our code at

Abstract: We present IntPhys 2, a video benchmark designed to evaluate the intuitive
physics understanding of deep learning models. Building on the original IntPhys
benchmark, IntPhys 2 focuses on four core principles related to macroscopic
objects: Permanence, Immutability, Spatio-Temporal Continuity, and Solidity.
These conditions are inspired by research into intuitive physical understanding
emerging during early childhood. IntPhys 2 offers a comprehensive suite of
tests, based on the violation of expectation framework, that challenge models
to differentiate between possible and impossible events within controlled and
diverse virtual environments. Alongside the benchmark, we provide performance
evaluations of several state-of-the-art models. Our findings indicate that
while these models demonstrate basic visual understanding, they face
significant challenges in grasping intuitive physics across the four principles
in complex scenes, with most models performing at chance levels (50%), in stark
contrast to human performance, which achieves near-perfect accuracy. This
underscores the gap between current models and human-like intuitive physics
understanding, highlighting the need for advancements in model architectures

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in
semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates
Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS
aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining
robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world
scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo,
a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS
and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation
Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract
domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and
textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1)
GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and
progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior
Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and
stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding
Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust
prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the
effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art
performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain
generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable
solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 为2D训练的VLM与3D理解之间提供了一条可扩展且高效的路径，适用于空间多模态任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse
visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their
understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a
lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired
geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By
distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3)
dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R,
VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining
compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D
vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently
outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with
significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and
efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up
wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖强3D先验知识和已知相机姿态，限制了通用性。本文探讨减少3D依赖的可行性，并发现数据规模扩大时，减少3D依赖的方法性能提升更快。

Method: 提出了一种最小化3D先验和姿态依赖的NVS框架，直接从稀疏2D图像学习隐式3D感知，无需3D先验或姿态标注。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成逼真且3D一致的新视图，性能与依赖姿态输入的方法相当。

Conclusion: 数据驱动范式在减少3D依赖方面具有可行性，为大规模数据时代的NVS提供了新思路。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS), which
aims to generate photorealistic novel views from sparse or even unposed 2D
images without per-scene optimization. This task remains fundamentally
challenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and
ambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D
knowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding
explicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and
ground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts
have sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera
poses of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and
the necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:
the performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as
data scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D
knowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of
reducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated
by and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D
inductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By
eliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and
learns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D
inductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel
views, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed
inputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our
data-centric paradigm. Project page:

Motivation: 探索胶囊网络在姿态感知表示中的潜力，避免依赖专用预测器实现等变性。

Method: 利用胶囊网络的固有姿态感知能力，设计EquiCaps，并通过多几何变换任务验证其性能。

Result: EquiCaps在3DIEBench-T数据集上旋转预测任务中表现优于现有方法，R²达0.78。

Conclusion: EquiCaps展示了胶囊网络在等变性任务中的潜力，且在多几何变换下仍保持稳健性能。

Abstract: Learning self-supervised representations that are invariant and equivariant
to transformations is crucial for advancing beyond traditional visual
classification tasks. However, many methods rely on predictor architectures to
encode equivariance, despite evidence that architectural choices, such as
capsule networks, inherently excel at learning interpretable pose-aware
representations. To explore this, we introduce EquiCaps (Equivariant Capsule
Network), a capsule-based approach to pose-aware self-supervision that
eliminates the need for a specialised predictor for enforcing equivariance.
Instead, we leverage the intrinsic pose-awareness capabilities of capsules to
improve performance in pose estimation tasks. To further challenge our
assumptions, we increase task complexity via multi-geometric transformations to
enable a more thorough evaluation of invariance and equivariance by introducing
3DIEBench-T, an extension of a 3D object-rendering benchmark dataset. Empirical
results demonstrate that EquiCaps outperforms prior state-of-the-art
equivariant methods on rotation prediction, achieving a supervised-level $R^2$
of 0.78 on the 3DIEBench rotation prediction benchmark and improving upon SIE
and CapsIE by 0.05 and 0.04 $R^2$, respectively. Moreover, in contrast to
non-capsule-based equivariant approaches, EquiCaps maintains robust equivariant
performance under combined geometric transformations, underscoring its
generalisation capabilities and the promise of predictor-free capsule

*Tao Liu,Zhenchao Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出E-FPN-BS架构，解决特征金字塔网络中高层特征因零正锚点导致的语义缺失问题，通过多尺度特征增强和自适应优化提升小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征金字塔网络中高层特征（P5-P6）常因零正锚点而无法训练，导致语义表示缺失，同时低层特征缺乏语义上下文。

Method: 提出E-FPN-BS架构，包含上下文增强模块（CEM）和前景-背景分离模块（FBSM），并引入动态梯度平衡损失（DCLoss）解决梯度不平衡问题。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法具有出色的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: E-FPN-BS有效解决了高层特征语义缺失问题，提升了小目标检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Tiny object detection (TOD) reveals a fundamental flaw in feature pyramid
networks: high-level features (P5-P6) frequently receive zero positive anchors
under standard label assignment protocols, leaving their semantic
representations untrained due to exclusion from loss computation. This creates
dual deficiencies: (1) Stranded high-level features become semantic dead-ends
without gradient updates, while (2) low-level features lack essential semantic
context for robust classification. We propose E-FPN-BS that systematically
converts wasted high-level semantics into low-level feature enhancements. To
address these issues, we propose E-FPN-BS, a novel architecture integrating
multi-scale feature enhancement and adaptive optimization. First, our Context
Enhancement Module(CEM) employs dual-branch processing to align and compress
high-level features for effective global-local fusion. Second, the
Foreground-Background Separation Module (FBSM) generates spatial gating masks
that dynamically amplify discriminative regions. To address gradient imbalance
across object scales, we further propose a Dynamic Gradient-Balanced Loss
(DCLoss) that automatically modulates loss contributions via scale-aware
gradient equilibrium. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate the outstanding performance and generalization ability of our
approach.

*Tilemachos Aravanis,Panagiotis Filntisis,Petros Maragos,George Retsinas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Only-Style方法，通过自适应调整参数来减少风格一致生成中的内容泄漏问题，并提出了新的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在风格一致生成中难以有效分离语义内容和风格元素，导致内容泄漏问题。

Method: Only-Style通过定位内容泄漏并自适应调整风格对齐参数，同时提出独立组件和评估框架。

Result: 方法在多样实例中显著优于现有技术，实现了无内容泄漏的稳健风格一致性。

Conclusion: Only-Style有效解决了内容泄漏问题，同时保持了风格一致性，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating images in a consistent reference visual style remains a
challenging computer vision task. State-of-the-art methods aiming for
style-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content
from stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as
a reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a
method designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner
while preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content
leakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that
controls the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches
containing the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best
balances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the
localization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a
reference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any
method-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the
stylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to
quantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired
content leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over
state-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances,
consistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content
leakage.

TL;DR: MetricHMR提出了一种从单目图像中恢复具有准确全局平移的度量尺度人体网格的方法，解决了现有HMR方法在尺度和深度上的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法存在严重的尺度和深度模糊性，导致重建结果在几何上不合理。MetricHMR旨在解决这一问题，实现度量尺度的准确重建。

Method: 通过系统分析现有HMR方法的相机模型，强调标准透视投影模型的关键作用，并提出基于射线图的新方法，联合编码边界框信息、相机参数和几何线索，实现端到端的度量尺度HMR。

Result: 实验表明，MetricHMR在度量姿态、形状和全局平移估计上达到最先进性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MetricHMR通过标准透视投影模型和射线图方法，实现了度量尺度的人体网格恢复，解决了尺度和深度模糊性问题。

Abstract: We introduce MetricHMR (Metric Human Mesh Recovery), an approach for metric
human mesh recovery with accurate global translation from monocular images. In
contrast to existing HMR methods that suffer from severe scale and depth
ambiguity, MetricHMR is able to produce geometrically reasonable body shape and
global translation in the reconstruction results. To this end, we first
systematically analyze previous HMR methods on camera models to emphasize the
critical role of the standard perspective projection model in enabling
metric-scale HMR. We then validate the acceptable ambiguity range of metric HMR
under the standard perspective projection model. Finally, we contribute a novel
approach that introduces a ray map based on the standard perspective projection
to jointly encode bounding-box information, camera parameters, and geometric
cues for End2End metric HMR without any additional metric-regularization
modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with sequential HMR methods, in
metric pose, shape, and global translation estimation across both indoor and
in-the-wild scenarios.

*Jianhan Qi,Yuheng Jia,Hui Liu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合结构-光谱图卷积算子（SSGCO）和证据引导的自适应边缘学习（EGAEL）模块的方法，用于高光谱图像（HSI）聚类，显著提升了聚类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络（GNNs）的方法无法充分利用HSI的光谱信息，且超像素拓扑图的不准确性可能导致类语义混淆。

Method: 提出SSGCO提取空间和光谱特征，并设计EGAEL模块自适应优化边缘权重，结合对比学习框架实现聚类。

Result: 在四个HSI数据集上，聚类精度分别提升了2.61%、6.06%、4.96%和3.15%。

Conclusion: SSGCO和EGAEL模块有效提升了HSI聚类的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class
without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For
large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform
superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However,
existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI,
and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of
different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these
challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator
(SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their
representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral
features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL)
module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel
topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning
framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering
are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best
compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaNorm是一种新型线性变换方法，通过归一化激活特征通道并结合Hadamard变换，有效减少异常值，实现更激进的激活量化，提升扩散模型的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成领域表现优异，但其高内存和计算需求限制了在资源受限设备上的部署。现有的后训练量化方法在处理异常值和实现高压缩时存在困难。

Method: 提出HadaNorm方法，通过归一化激活特征通道并应用Hadamard变换，减少量化误差，实现更高效的矩阵操作压缩。

Result: HadaNorm在多种Transformer模块中均能减少量化误差，并在效率与性能的权衡上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HadaNorm为扩散模型在资源受限设备上的部署提供了一种高效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their
high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained
devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by
reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods
struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires
transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work,
we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing
approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations
feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more
aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently
reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks,
achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LEO-VL是一种基于高效场景表示（CFG）的3D-VL模型，通过大规模训练和多样化任务数据，实现了在多个3D QA基准上的领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D-VL通用模型在能力和鲁棒性上落后于2D模型的问题，特别是数据可扩展性和高效场景表示的障碍。

Method: 提出LEO-VL模型，采用CFG（压缩特征网格）作为高效场景表示，并结合大规模多任务数据训练。

Result: 在SQA3D、MSQA和Beacon3D等基准测试中取得最佳性能，验证了CFG的高效性和数据多样性的重要性。

Conclusion: LEO-VL和SceneDPO为开发可扩展且鲁棒的3D-VL通用模型提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Developing 3D-VL generalists capable of understanding 3D scenes and following
natural language instructions to perform a wide range of tasks has been a
long-standing goal in the 3D-VL community. Despite recent progress, 3D-VL
models still lag behind their 2D counterparts in capability and robustness,
falling short of the generalist standard. A key obstacle to developing 3D-VL
generalists lies in data scalability, hindered by the lack of an efficient
scene representation. We propose LEO-VL, a 3D-VL model built upon condensed
feature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation that bridges 2D
perception and 3D spatial structure while significantly reducing token
overhead. This efficiency unlocks large-scale training towards 3D-VL
generalist, for which we curate over 700k high-quality 3D-VL data spanning four
domains of real-world indoor scenes and five tasks such as captioning and
dialogue. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of 3D QA
benchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Ablation studies confirm the
efficiency of our representation, the importance of task and scene diversity,
and the validity of our data curation principle. Furthermore, we introduce
SceneDPO, a novel post-training objective that enhances the robustness of 3D-VL
models. We hope our findings contribute to the advancement of scalable and
robust 3D-VL generalists.

TL;DR: CausalVQA是一个用于视频问答（VQA）的基准数据集，专注于模型对物理世界中因果关系的理解，填补了现有数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA数据集多关注表面感知或狭窄的物理推理问题，缺乏对真实场景中因果关系的深入探究。

Method: CausalVQA设计了五种问题类型（反事实、假设、预期、规划和描述性），并通过质量控制机制避免模型利用语言捷径。

Result: 当前前沿多模态模型在基准测试中表现远低于人类，尤其在预期和假设问题上。

Conclusion: CausalVQA揭示了当前系统在时空推理、物理原理理解和替代方案预测方面的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering
(VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of
causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus
on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical
reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an
important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in
real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely
outcomes of different actions and events through five question types:
counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We
designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial
shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding
instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models
fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on
anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for
current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of
physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make
accurate predictions in real-world settings.

Result: 在多种对象和场景级任务中验证了方法的通用有效性。

Conclusion: UniPre3D是首个适用于任意尺度和架构的统一预训练方法，为3D视觉提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in
developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently,
there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally
effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we
introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be
seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any
architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training
task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling
precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further
regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus
toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image
models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the
universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments
across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud
models as backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/UniPre3D.

Result: 提供了多个基线模型，展示了任务的挑战性，并公开了数据集。

Conclusion: 该任务为未来研究提供了新方向，数据集有助于推动相关领域发展。

Abstract: In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must
identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external
knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a
visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must
both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where
the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information.
Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the
subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of
$2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$
interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in
specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that
is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant
video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the
dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and
show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly
available here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the great success of the generalist model in
natural language processing. The generalist model is a general framework
trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks
simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing
number of researchers are venturing into the realm of applying these models to
computer vision tasks. However, the inputs and outputs of vision tasks are more
diverse, and it is difficult to summarize them as a unified representation. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the vision generalist
models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field.
First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks.
Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing
research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their
performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a
brief excursion into related domains, shedding light on their interconnections
and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application
scenarios, undertake a thorough examination of the persistent challenges, and
offer insights into possible directions for future research endeavors.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising field for
developing clinical decision support systems, yet progress is often limited by
the available datasets, which can lack clinical complexity and visual
diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,
large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly
expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new
question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We
developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these
questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's
inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world
clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations
that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two
main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test
model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more
challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate
the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in
clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data
principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

Result: 模型VILASR在多个空间推理任务中平均提升18.4%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过视觉绘图操作，模型能够更有效地表达和分析空间关系，突破了纯文本方法的局限性。

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced
significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,
text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted
purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal
input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in
spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and
continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental
visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing
to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through
elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with
basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing
auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships
through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling
imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning
approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training
framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing
abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,
and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms
existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze
navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and
multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

Result: 在多种输入图像上验证了方法的高保真度和优质笔触效果。

Conclusion: 该方法能更好地满足艺术原则和意图，提升绘画质量。

Abstract: Creating a stroke-by-stroke evolution process of a visual artwork tries to
bridge the emotional and educational gap between the finished static artwork
and its creation process. Recent stroke-based painting systems focus on
capturing stroke details by predicting and iteratively refining stroke
parameters to maximize the similarity between the input image and the rendered
output. However, these methods often struggle to produce stroke compositions
that align with artistic principles and intent. To address this, we explore an
image-to-painting method that (i) facilitates semantic guidance for brush
strokes in targeted regions, (ii) computes the brush stroke parameters, and
(iii) establishes a sequence among segments and strokes to sequentially render
the final painting. Experimental results on various input image types, such as
face images, paintings, and photographic images, show that our method aligns
with a region-based painting strategy while rendering a painting with high
fidelity and superior stroke quality.

Motivation: 现有方法生成的3D对象通常将所有部分融合为一个整体，限制了编辑和操纵单个部分的能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D object generation has greatly improved both the quality
and efficiency. However, most existing methods generate a single mesh with all
parts fused together, which limits the ability to edit or manipulate individual
parts. A key challenge is that different objects may have a varying number of
parts. To address this, we propose a new end-to-end framework for part-level 3D
object generation. Given a single input image, our method generates
high-quality 3D objects with an arbitrary number of complete and semantically
meaningful parts. We introduce a dual volume packing strategy that organizes
all parts into two complementary volumes, allowing for the creation of complete
and interleaved parts that assemble into the final object. Experiments show
that our model achieves better quality, diversity, and generalization than
previous image-based part-level generation methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Symbolic Graph Ranker (SGR)的方法，结合文本和图结构信息，利用大语言模型(LLMs)提升会话搜索的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前会话搜索方法侧重于顺序建模或通用图结构表示，忽略了词级语义和图形结构的结合。

Method: SGR通过符号语法规则将会话图转换为文本，并设计自监督任务（如链接预测和节点内容生成）增强LLMs对图结构的理解。

Result: 在AOL和Tiangong-ST数据集上的实验证明了SGR的优越性。

Conclusion: SGR为传统搜索策略与现代LLMs之间架起了桥梁，提供了一种新颖有效的方法。

Abstract: Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to
fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically
prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the
graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing
structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,
neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic
Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and
graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models
(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to
convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,
interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.
Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual
corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,
our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a
textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic
learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and
generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological
information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and
comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm
the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective
methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前4D内容生成面临建模时空分布的复杂性和训练数据稀缺的挑战，AnimateAnyMesh旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用DyMeshVAE架构分离时空特征并保持局部拓扑结构，结合Rectified Flow训练策略实现文本条件生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在几秒内生成语义准确且时序连贯的网格动画，质量和效率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AnimateAnyMesh显著推动了4D内容生成的实用性和可访问性，相关数据和模型将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D content generation have attracted increasing attention,
yet creating high-quality animated 3D models remains challenging due to the
complexity of modeling spatio-temporal distributions and the scarcity of 4D
training data. In this paper, we present AnimateAnyMesh, the first feed-forward
framework that enables efficient text-driven animation of arbitrary 3D meshes.
Our approach leverages a novel DyMeshVAE architecture that effectively
compresses and reconstructs dynamic mesh sequences by disentangling spatial and
temporal features while preserving local topological structures. To enable
high-quality text-conditional generation, we employ a Rectified Flow-based
training strategy in the compressed latent space. Additionally, we contribute
the DyMesh Dataset, containing over 4M diverse dynamic mesh sequences with text
annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
semantically accurate and temporally coherent mesh animations in a few seconds,
significantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and efficiency.
Our work marks a substantial step forward in making 4D content creation more
accessible and practical. All the data, code, and models will be open-released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了MVP基准测试，用于评估视频语言模型的物理世界理解能力，通过最小变化对避免模型依赖表面线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试因依赖表面视觉或文本线索而难以准确评估模型的时空理解能力。

Method: 引入MVP基准测试，包含55K个高质量多选题视频QA样本，每个样本配有最小变化对。

Result: 人类表现92.9%，最佳开源模型40.2%，随机表现25%。

Conclusion: MVP基准测试能更准确地评估模型的物理理解能力，避免表面线索的干扰。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for assessing the spatio-temporal understanding and
reasoning abilities of video language models are susceptible to score inflation
due to the presence of shortcut solutions based on superficial visual or
textual cues. This paper mitigates the challenges in accurately assessing model
performance by introducing the Minimal Video Pairs (MVP) benchmark, a simple
shortcut-aware video QA benchmark for assessing the physical understanding of
video language models. The benchmark is comprised of 55K high-quality
multiple-choice video QA examples focusing on physical world understanding.
Examples are curated from nine video data sources, spanning first-person
egocentric and exocentric videos, robotic interaction data, and cognitive
science intuitive physics benchmarks. To mitigate shortcut solutions that rely
on superficial visual or textual cues and biases, each sample in MVP has a
minimal-change pair -- a visually similar video accompanied by an identical
question but an opposing answer. To answer a question correctly, a model must
provide correct answers for both examples in the minimal-change pair; as such,
models that solely rely on visual or textual biases would achieve below random
performance. Human performance on MVP is 92.9\%, while the best open-source
state-of-the-art video-language model achieves 40.2\% compared to random
performance at 25\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，文本引导的图像编辑日益普及，但缺乏一个全面的框架来验证和评估这些编辑的质量。

Method: 引入EditInspector基准，利用人工标注评估编辑质量，并测试现有模型在多个维度上的表现。提出了两种新方法以改进模型表现。

Result: 当前模型在评估编辑时表现不佳，容易产生幻觉。新方法在伪影检测和差异描述生成上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: EditInspector为文本引导编辑评估提供了新基准，新方法显著提升了评估效果。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.

Motivation: 探索如何通过声音增强3D场景的交互性，使其更真实。

Method: 录制人手操作3D场景中物体的视频，利用动作-声音对训练修正流模型，将3D手部轨迹映射到对应音频。

Result: 生成的音频能准确传达材质属性和动作，人类观察者难以区分其与真实声音。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了通过手部动作预测声音，提升了3D场景的交互体验。

Abstract: We study the problem of making 3D scene reconstructions interactive by asking
the following question: can we predict the sounds of human hands physically
interacting with a scene? First, we record a video of a human manipulating
objects within a 3D scene using their hands. We then use these action-sound
pairs to train a rectified flow model to map 3D hand trajectories to their
corresponding audio. At test time, a user can query the model for other
actions, parameterized as sequences of hand poses, to estimate their
corresponding sounds. In our experiments, we find that our generated sounds
accurately convey material properties and actions, and that they are often
indistinguishable to human observers from real sounds. Project page:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本识别准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAIR任务和TeReDiff框架为文本感知图像修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

Abstract: We introduce PlayerOne, the first egocentric realistic world simulator,
facilitating immersive and unrestricted exploration within vividly dynamic
environments. Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can
accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos
that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured
by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that
first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for
coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous
motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our
automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of
different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme,
enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a
joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and
video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation.
Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise
control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse
scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在移动设备上难以达到90 FPS的实时要求，现有加速器忽视内存效率，导致DRAM流量冗余。

Method: 提出STREAMINGGS，采用完全流式设计，从基于瓦片的渲染转变为基于内存的渲染，实现细粒度流水线并减少DRAM流量。

Result: 设计在移动Ampere GPU上实现了45.7倍加速和62.9倍能耗节省。

Conclusion: STREAMINGGS通过优化内存效率，显著提升了3DGS在移动设备上的实时性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its efficiency and
sparse Gaussian-based representation. However, 3DGS struggles to meet the
real-time requirement of 90 frames per second (FPS) on resource-constrained
mobile devices, achieving only 2 to 9 FPS.Existing accelerators focus on
compute efficiency but overlook memory efficiency, leading to redundant DRAM
traffic. We introduce STREAMINGGS, a fully streaming 3DGS
algorithm-architecture co-design that achieves fine-grained pipelining and
reduces DRAM traffic by transforming from a tile-centric rendering to a
memory-centric rendering. Results show that our design achieves up to 45.7

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动插值方法依赖复杂模型，本文旨在探索简单模型通过数据优化实现高质量动画的可能性。

Method: 使用单一Transformer编码器，重点优化数据建模（如数据量、姿态表示和速度特征）。

Result: 实验表明，数据优化能提升运动过渡质量，挑战了模型复杂度决定动画质量的假设。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的优化策略可替代复杂模型，为运动插值提供新思路。

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is a crucial tool for animators, enabling intricate
control over pose-level details in each keyframe. Recent machine learning
solutions for motion in-betweening rely on complex models, incorporating
skeleton-aware architectures or requiring multiple modules and training steps.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework,
employing a single Transformer encoder to synthesize realistic motions for
motion in-betweening tasks. We find that data modeling choices play a
significant role in improving in-betweening performance. Among others, we show
that increasing data volume can yield equivalent or improved motion
transitions, that the choice of pose representation is vital for achieving
high-quality results, and that incorporating velocity input features enhances
animation performance. These findings challenge the assumption that model
complexity is the primary determinant of animation quality and provide insights
into a more data-centric approach to motion interpolation. Additional videos

Abstract: We leverage finetuned video diffusion models, intrinsic decomposition of
videos, and physically-based differentiable rendering to generate high quality
materials for 3D models given a text prompt or a single image. We condition a
video diffusion model to respect the input geometry and lighting condition.
This model produces multiple views of a given 3D model with coherent material
properties. Secondly, we use a recent model to extract intrinsics (base color,
roughness, metallic) from the generated video. Finally, we use the intrinsics
alongside the generated video in a differentiable path tracer to robustly
extract PBR materials directly compatible with common content creation tools.

TL;DR: TransGI是一种新型神经渲染方法，用于实时高保真全局光照，通过对象中心神经传输模型和辐射共享照明系统实现高效渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经渲染算法在实时渲染和任意光照条件下表达性和效率不足的问题。

Method: 采用基于MLP的解码器和顶点附着潜在特征的对象中心神经传输模型，结合局部光探针和辐射共享策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，TransGI在每帧渲染时间小于10毫秒的同时，显著提升了渲染质量。

Conclusion: TransGI在实时渲染中实现了高效且高质量的全局光照效果，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Neural rendering algorithms have revolutionized computer graphics, yet their
impact on real-time rendering under arbitrary lighting conditions remains
limited due to strict latency constraints in practical applications. The key
challenge lies in formulating a compact yet expressive material representation.
To address this, we propose TransGI, a novel neural rendering method for
real-time, high-fidelity global illumination. It comprises an object-centric
neural transfer model for material representation and a radiance-sharing
lighting system for efficient illumination. Traditional BSDF representations
and spatial neural material representations lack expressiveness, requiring
thousands of ray evaluations to converge to noise-free colors. Conversely,
real-time methods trade quality for efficiency by supporting only diffuse
materials. In contrast, our object-centric neural transfer model achieves
compactness and expressiveness through an MLP-based decoder and vertex-attached
latent features, supporting glossy effects with low memory overhead. For
dynamic, varying lighting conditions, we introduce local light probes capturing
scene radiance, coupled with an across-probe radiance-sharing strategy for
efficient probe generation. We implemented our method in a real-time rendering
engine, combining compute shaders and CUDA-based neural networks. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves real-time performance of less than
10 ms to render a frame and significantly improved rendering quality compared
to baseline methods.

Result: DGS-LRM在动态重建质量上媲美优化方法，优于现有预测方法，且适用于长程3D跟踪。

Conclusion: DGS-LRM为动态场景重建提供了高效、通用的解决方案，性能优越。

Abstract: We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model
(DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian
splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene
reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly
create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing
models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of
moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene
reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training
data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To
address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an
enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and
dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian
representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view
synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network
that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves
dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,
while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic
reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded
3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking
tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D
tracking methods.

Motivation: 近年来，公平分配领域的研究集中在EFX分配上，特别是在(p,q)-有界估值下。本文旨在改进现有结果，证明更强的分配存在性。

Method: 通过多图表示代理人和商品的关系，研究加性(2,∞)-有界估值下的EFX分配。

Result: 证明了在加性(2,∞)-有界估值下，存在(1/√2)-EFX分配，改进了之前的(2/3)-EFX结果。

Conclusion: 本文为EFX分配提供了更强的理论保证，扩展了公平分配的研究范围。

Abstract: In recent years, a new line of work in fair allocation has focused on EFX
allocations for \((p, q)\)-bounded valuations, where each good is relevant to
at most \(p\) agents, and any pair of agents share at most \(q\) relevant
goods. For the case \(p = 2\) and \(q = \infty\), such instances can be
equivalently represented as multigraphs whose vertices are the agents and whose
edges represent goods, each edge incident to exactly the one or two agents for
whom the good is relevant. A recent result of \citet{amanatidis2024pushing}
shows that for additive $(2,\infty)$ bounded valuations, a
\((\nicefrac{2}{3})\)-EFX allocation always exists. In this paper, we improve
this bound by proving the existence of a \((\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\)-\(\efx\)
allocation for additive \((2,\infty)\)-bounded valuations.

Motivation: 探讨垄断者在多物品拍卖中的议价能力，并量化其价值，以简化最优机制设计的复杂性。

Method: 在多物品拍卖环境中，分析简单拍卖（单独销售或捆绑销售）所需的额外竞标者数量，并与最优机制进行比较。

Result: 在强正则性假设下，单独销售物品的简单拍卖仅需Θ(n/α)额外竞标者，而捆绑销售在小物品数量或单调风险率分布下仅需常数额外竞标者。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，简单拍卖在某些条件下可以显著减少最优机制设计的复杂性，尤其是在大规模市场中。

Abstract: We quantify the value of the monopoly's bargaining power in terms of
competition complexity--that is, the number of additional bidders the monopoly
must attract in simple auctions to match the expected revenue of the optimal
mechanisms (c.f., Bulow and Klemperer, 1996, Eden et al., 2017)--within the
setting of multi-item auctions. We show that for simple auctions that sell
items separately, the competition complexity is $\Theta(\frac{n}{\alpha})$ in
an environment with $n$ original bidders under the slightly stronger assumption
of $\alpha$-strong regularity, in contrast to the standard regularity
assumption in the literature, which requires $\Omega(n \cdot \ln \frac{m}{n})$
additional bidders (Feldman et al., 2018). This significantly reduces the value
of learning the distribution to design the optimal mechanisms, especially in
large markets with many items for sale. For simple auctions that sell items as
a grand bundle, we establish a constant competition complexity bound in a
single-bidder environment when the number of items is small or when the value
distribution has a monotone hazard rate. Some of our competition complexity
results also hold when we compete against the first best benchmark (i.e.,
optimal social welfare).

Abstract: Real-time face orientation recognition is a cutting-edge technology meant to
track and analyze facial movements in virtual environments such as online
interviews, remote meetings, and virtual classrooms. As the demand for virtual
interactions grows, it becomes increasingly important to measure participant
engagement, attention, and overall interaction. This research presents a novel
solution that leverages the Media Pipe Face Mesh framework to identify facial
landmarks and extract geometric data for calculating Euler angles, which
determine head orientation in real time. The system tracks 3D facial landmarks
and uses this data to compute head movements with a focus on accuracy and
responsiveness. By studying Euler angles, the system can identify a user's head
orientation with an accuracy of 90\%, even at a distance of up to four feet.
This capability offers significant enhancements for monitoring user
interaction, allowing for more immersive and interactive virtual ex-periences.
The proposed method shows its reliability in evaluating participant
attentiveness during online assessments and meetings. Its application goes
beyond engagement analysis, potentially providing a means for improving the
quality of virtual communication, fostering better understanding between
participants, and ensuring a higher level of interaction in digital spaces.
This study offers a basis for future developments in enhancing virtual user

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了用户视角偏好的实证数据，还公开了数据集，支持未来3D图绘制视角评估的研究。

Abstract: The visual analysis of graphs in 3D has become increasingly popular,
accelerated by the rise of immersive technology, such as augmented and virtual
reality. Unlike 2D drawings, 3D graph layouts are highly viewpoint-dependent,
making perspective selection critical for revealing structural and relational
patterns. Despite its importance, there is limited empirical evidence guiding
what constitutes an effective or preferred viewpoint from the user's
perspective. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation into
user-preferred viewpoints in 3D graph visualisations. We conducted a controlled
study with 23 participants in a virtual reality environment, where users
selected their most and least preferred viewpoints for 36 different graphs
varying in size and layout. From this data, enriched by qualitative feedback,
we distil common strategies underlying viewpoint choice. We further analyse the
alignment of user preferences with classical 2D aesthetic criteria (e.g.,
Crossings), 3D-specific measures (e.g., Node-Node Occlusion), and introduce a
novel measure capturing the perceivability of a graph's principal axes
(Isometric Viewpoint Deviation). Our data-driven analysis indicates that
Stress, Crossings, Gabriel Ratio, Edge-Node Overlap, and Isometric Viewpoint
Deviation are key indicators of viewpoint preference. Beyond our findings, we
contribute a publicly available dataset consisting of the graphs and computed
aesthetic measures, supporting further research and the development of
viewpoint evaluation measures for 3D graph drawing.

TL;DR: 研究发现，社交规范和个人信念影响电子表格专家分享知识的行为，技术设计与社会动态的复杂互动塑造了协作学习行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨电子表格专家为何难以分享知识，以及社交规范和技术设计如何影响协作学习。

Method: 对31名专业电子表格用户进行半结构化访谈。

Result: 专家面临个性化策略适应、自我评价冲突、规范信念和协作担忧等挑战。

Conclusion: 技术设计需平衡初始易学性与长期学习需求，以促进知识分享。

Abstract: Spreadsheet collaboration provides valuable opportunities for learning and
expertise sharing between colleagues. Sharing expertise is essential for the
retention of important technical skillsets within organisations, but previous
studies suggest that spreadsheet experts often fail to disseminate their
knowledge to others. We suggest that social norms and beliefs surrounding the
value of spreadsheet use significantly influence user engagement in sharing
behaviours. To explore this, we conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with
professional spreadsheet users from two separate samples. We found that
spreadsheet providers face challenges in adapting highly personalised
strategies to often subjective standards and evaluating the appropriate social
timing of sharing. In addition, conflicted self-evaluations of one's
spreadsheet expertise, dismissive normative beliefs about the value of this
knowledge, and concerns about the potential disruptions associated with
collaboration can further deter sharing. We suggest these observations reflect
the challenges of long-term learning in feature-rich software designed
primarily with initial learnability in mind. We therefore provide implications
for design to navigate this tension. Overall, our findings demonstrate how the
complex interaction between technology design and social dynamics can shape
collaborative learning behaviours in the context of feature-rich software.

Method: 方法包括对早期用户的访谈，并结合“使用与满足理论”和“不确定性减少理论”进行分析。

Result: 研究发现用户面临功能、交互和社交三种不确定性，这些未满足的期望导致挫败感或放弃使用。

Conclusion: 结论强调了透明度、任务导向设计和用户控制的重要性，并提出了设计和政策建议，以推动更可信赖的AI助手发展。

Abstract: This paper examines the gap between the promises and real-world performance
of emerging AI personal assistants. Drawing on interviews with early adopters
of devices like Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin, as well as services like Ohai and
Docus, we map user experiences through the lens of Uses and Gratifications and
Uncertainty Reduction Theory. We identify three core types of user uncertainty,
functional, interactional, and social, and explore how each disrupts different
user gratifications. We show that while marketing hype fuels initial adoption,
unmet expectations often result in frustration or abandonment. Our findings
highlight the importance of transparency, task-specific design, and user
control over contextual memory and personalization. We provide design and
policy recommendations, including user-facing explainability tools and calls
for regulatory benchmarks such as CI Bench, to guide ethical and interpretable
AI integration. Our study offers actionable insights for creating more usable,
trustworthy, and socially aligned AI assistants.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨个性化AI对话是否能有效纠正心理学和教育中的顽固误解。

Method: 通过预注册实验，比较个性化AI对话、通用教科书式反驳和中性AI对话的效果。

Result: 个性化AI对话在短期内显著减少误解，但长期效果与教科书式反驳趋同。

Conclusion: AI对话能加速初始纠正，但需结合结构化教育和强化以维持效果。

Abstract: Misconceptions in psychology and education persist despite clear
contradictory evidence, resisting traditional correction methods. This study
investigated whether personalised AI dialogue could effectively correct these
stubborn beliefs. In a preregistered experiment (N = 375), participants holding
strong psychology misconceptions engaged in one of three interventions: (1)
personalised AI dialogue targeting their specific misconception, (2) generic
textbook-style refutation, or (3) neutral AI dialogue (control). Results showed
that personalised AI dialogue produced significantly larger immediate belief
reductions compared to both textbook reading and neutral dialogue. This
advantage persisted at 10-day follow-up but diminished by 2 months, where AI
dialogue and textbook conditions converged while both remained superior to
control. Both AI conditions generated significantly higher engagement and
confidence than textbook reading, demonstrating the motivational benefits of
conversational interaction. These findings demonstrate that AI dialogue can
accelerate initial belief correction through personalised, interactive
engagement that disrupts the cognitive processes maintaining misconceptions.
However, the convergence of effects over time suggests brief interventions
require reinforcement for lasting change. Future applications should integrate
AI tutoring into structured educational programs with spaced reinforcement to
sustain the initial advantages of personalised dialogue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康问题日益严重，AI驱动的解决方案可能扩展心理支持的可及性，但同伴支持的质量和安全性存在挑战。

Method: 开发了一个AI支持系统，包括LLM模拟客户、实时建议和情绪可视化，并通过混合方法研究评估其效果。

Result: 同伴支持者和专家认可系统的潜力，但也发现同伴支持者在关键问题上的不足，如忽略痛苦信号和过早建议。

Conclusion: 需标准化培训，LLM系统需谨慎设计并接受专家指导，以负责任地整合AI于心理健康领域。

Abstract: Mental health is a growing global concern, prompting interest in AI-driven
solutions to expand access to psychosocial support. Peer support, grounded in
lived experience, offers a valuable complement to professional care. However,
variability in training, effectiveness, and definitions raises concerns about
quality, consistency, and safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) present new
opportunities to enhance peer support interactions, particularly in real-time,
text-based interactions. We present and evaluate an AI-supported system with an
LLM-simulated distressed client, context-sensitive LLM-generated suggestions,
and real-time emotion visualisations. 2 mixed-methods studies with 12 peer
supporters and 5 mental health professionals (i.e., experts) examined the
system's effectiveness and implications for practice. Both groups recognised
its potential to enhance training and improve interaction quality. However, we
found a key tension emerged: while peer supporters engaged meaningfully,
experts consistently flagged critical issues in peer supporter responses, such
as missed distress cues and premature advice-giving. This misalignment
highlights potential limitations in current peer support training, especially
in emotionally charged contexts where safety and fidelity to best practices are
essential. Our findings underscore the need for standardised, psychologically
grounded training, especially as peer support scales globally. They also
demonstrate how LLM-supported systems can scaffold this development--if
designed with care and guided by expert oversight. This work contributes to
emerging conversations on responsible AI integration in mental health and the
evolving role of LLMs in augmenting peer-delivered care.

As digital platforms increasingly mediate such support, the design and impact
of these technologies remain under-examined, particularly in Asian contexts.
This paper presents findings from an interview study with 20 peer supporters in
Singapore, who operate across diverse online, offline, and hybrid environments.
Through a thematic analysis, we unpack how participants start, conduct, and
sustain peer support, highlighting their motivations, emotional labour, and the
sociocultural dimensions shaping their practices. Building on this grounded
understanding, we surface design directions for culturally responsive digital
tools that scaffold rather than supplant relational care. Drawing insights from
qualitative accounts, we offer a situated perspective on how AI might
responsibly augment peer support. This research contributes to human-centred
computing by articulating the lived realities of peer supporters and proposing
design implications for trustworthy and context-sensitive AI in mental health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形变触觉界面（SCHIs）是一个新兴领域，但关于动态形状感知的研究较少，且抓握类型和位移特性的影响尚未正式评估。

Method: 采用心理物理学用户研究，使用1-DOF平移SCHI设备，参与者以三种不同抓握方式完成恒定刺激法实验，测试不同位移大小和方向。

Result: 结果表明，平移SCHI应最大化位移幅度而非接触手指数量；非线性的设备位置映射在实际应用中更有效。

Conclusion: 本研究为SCHI的感知特性提供了初步评估，并希望激发对其他SCHI形态的进一步研究。

Abstract: Shape-changing haptic interfaces (SCHIs) are a promising and emerging field.
However, compared to more established stimulus modalities, such as vibration,
there is sparse literature on the perception of dynamic shapes. Furthermore,
the influence of properties such as grasp types and displacement
magnitude/direction has not been formally evaluated. This work attempts to
initiate a formal perceptual evaluation of SCHIs via a psychophysical user
study involving a 1-DOF translational shape-changing interface that can move
its body with 1.25-micrometer resolution. Participants completed a Method of
Constant Stimulus study while holding the device with three different grasps.
Stimuli direction occurred both toward and away from the thumb, while the
standard stimuli varied between small (0.48 mm) and large (6 mm). Our results
indicate that translational SCHIs should maximize the translation magnitude
rather than the number of fingers in contact. We also demonstrated how to apply
our findings to real-world applications via a simple 'paddle game', where we
compared conventional linear mapping with non-linear mapping derived from our
perceptual experiment outcomes between the device position and its represented
value. Results indicate that the non-linear mapping was more effective, with
improved error distribution. We hope this work inspires further formal
perceptual investigation into other SCHI morphologies.

Method: 基于Zimmerman的三阶段SRL框架，开发了SRLAgent系统，结合游戏化和LLM实时反馈，通过实验对比评估效果。

Result: SRLAgent组在SRL技能上有显著提升（p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.234），且比对照组更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将SRL支持和AI实时反馈嵌入游戏化环境，对教育技术设计有重要启示。

Abstract: Self-regulated learning (SRL) is crucial for college students navigating
increased academic demands and independence. Insufficient SRL skills can lead
to disorganized study habits, low motivation, and poor time management,
undermining learners ability to thrive in challenging environments. Through a
formative study involving 59 college students, we identified key challenges
students face in developing SRL skills, including difficulties with
goal-setting, time management, and reflective learning. To address these
challenges, we introduce SRLAgent, an LLM-assisted system that fosters SRL
skills through gamification and adaptive support from large language models
(LLMs). Grounded in Zimmermans three-phase SRL framework, SRLAgent enables
students to engage in goal-setting, strategy execution, and self-reflection
within an interactive game-based environment. The system offers real-time
feedback and scaffolding powered by LLMs to support students independent study
efforts. We evaluated SRLAgent using a between-subjects design, comparing it to
a baseline system (SRL without Agent features) and a traditional multimedia
learning condition. Results showed significant improvements in SRL skills
within the SRLAgent group (p < .001, Cohens d = 0.234) and higher engagement
compared to the baselines. This work highlights the value of embedding SRL
scaffolding and real-time AI support within gamified environments, offering
design implications for educational technologies that aim to promote deeper
learning and metacognitive skill development.

Motivation: 传统实验方法测量抗体亲和力耗时且昂贵，人工智能尤其是大语言模型（LLMs）为抗体设计和亲和力预测提供了新途径。

Method: 利用开源Llama 3框架和Observed Antibody Space（OAS）数据库的抗体序列数据，开发了LlamaAffinity模型。

Result: 模型在准确率（0.9640）、F1分数（0.9643）、精确率（0.9702）、召回率（0.9586）和AUC-ROC（0.9936）上表现优异，且训练时间显著缩短（0.46小时）。

Conclusion: LlamaAffinity在抗体亲和力预测中表现出色，为AI驱动的抗体设计提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Antibody-facilitated immune responses are central to the body's defense
against pathogens, viruses, and other foreign invaders. The ability of
antibodies to specifically bind and neutralize antigens is vital for
maintaining immunity. Over the past few decades, bioengineering advancements
have significantly accelerated therapeutic antibody development. These
antibody-derived drugs have shown remarkable efficacy, particularly in treating
cancer, SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.
Traditionally, experimental methods for affinity measurement have been
time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of artificial intelligence, in
silico medicine has been revolutionized; recent developments in machine
learning, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs) for representing
antibodies, have opened up new avenues for AI-based design and improved
affinity prediction. Herein, we present an advanced antibody-antigen binding
affinity prediction model (LlamaAffinity), leveraging an open-source Llama 3
backbone and antibody sequence data sourced from the Observed Antibody Space
(OAS) database. The proposed approach shows significant improvement over
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (AntiFormer, AntiBERTa, AntiBERTy)
across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the model achieved an
accuracy of 0.9640, an F1-score of 0.9643, a precision of 0.9702, a recall of
0.9586, and an AUC-ROC of 0.9936. Moreover, this strategy unveiled higher
computational efficiency, with a five-fold average cumulative training time of
only 0.46 hours, significantly lower than in previous studies.

Result: 在多个基准问题上显著提升了解决方案质量和训练效率。

Conclusion: EAM是一种通用且高效的框架，能够稳定提升DRL和GA的性能。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are notoriously challenging due to their
discrete structure and exponentially large solution space. Recent advances in
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have enabled the learning heuristics directly
from data. However, DRL methods often suffer from limited exploration and
susceptibility to local optima. On the other hand, evolutionary algorithms such
as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) exhibit strong global exploration capabilities but
are typically sample inefficient and computationally intensive. In this work,
we propose the Evolutionary Augmentation Mechanism (EAM), a general and
plug-and-play framework that synergizes the learning efficiency of DRL with the
global search power of GAs. EAM operates by generating solutions from a learned
policy and refining them through domain-specific genetic operations such as
crossover and mutation. These evolved solutions are then selectively reinjected
into the policy training loop, thereby enhancing exploration and accelerating
convergence. We further provide a theoretical analysis that establishes an
upper bound on the KL divergence between the evolved solution distribution and
the policy distribution, ensuring stable and effective policy updates. EAM is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art DRL
solvers such as the Attention Model, POMO, and SymNCO. Extensive results on
benchmark problems (e.g., TSP, CVRP, PCTSP, and OP) demonstrate that EAM
significantly improves both solution quality and training efficiency over
competitive baselines.

Motivation: 语言模型在金融决策中缺乏对人类行为模式（如信息不对称下的专家依赖、损失厌恶和反馈驱动调整）的捕捉能力。

Method: FinHEAR通过多智能体框架，结合历史趋势分析、事件解读和专家知识检索，融入行为经济学原理。

Result: 在金融数据集上，FinHEAR在趋势预测和交易任务中表现优于基线模型，准确性和风险调整收益更高。

Conclusion: FinHEAR通过结合人类专业知识和自适应风险感知，显著提升了语言模型在金融决策中的表现。

Abstract: Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models,
demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to
dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general
reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central
to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information
asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We
propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive
Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to
analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve
expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in
behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval,
confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance
interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial
datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across
trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better
risk-adjusted returns.

Result: 证明了在最坏情况下所需最小指标数的上下界，并通过案例研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 形式化的代表性和比例性方法为评估指标子集选择提供了理论支持，并在实际应用中展现出潜力。

Abstract: A common problem in LLM evaluation is how to choose a subset of metrics from
a full suite of possible metrics. Subset selection is usually done for
efficiency or interpretability reasons, and the goal is often to select a
``representative'' subset of metrics. However, ``representative'' is rarely
clearly defined. In this work, we use ideas from social choice theory to
formalize two notions of representation for the selection of a subset of
evaluation metrics. We first introduce positional representation, which
guarantees every alternative is sufficiently represented at every position
cutoff. We then introduce positional proportionality, which guarantees no
alternative is proportionally over- or under-represented by more than a small
error at any position. We prove upper and lower bounds on the smallest number
of metrics needed to guarantee either of these properties in the worst case. We
also study a generalized form of each property that allows for additional input
on groups of metrics that must be represented. Finally, we tie theory to
practice through real-world case studies on both LLM evaluation and hospital
quality evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂任务如整页优化（WPO）中面临微调挑战，尤其是需要大量人工标注数据来减少幻觉和模型不稳定性。用户反馈虽可用但噪声大，需要更高效的监督方法。

Method: 提出PageLLM，采用混合粒度的奖励机制，结合页面级奖励（评估整体质量和连贯性）和项目级奖励（关注关键推荐的准确性和相关性）。

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上验证，PageLLM优于基线模型，并在在线A/B测试中实现0.44%的GMV增长，覆盖超过1000万用户。

Conclusion: PageLLM通过用户反馈驱动的奖励机制，有效解决了LLMs在WPO中的微调问题，展示了实际应用中的显著效果。

Abstract: Optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results is crucial
to enhancing user experience and engagement. Whole Page Optimization (WPO)
plays a pivotal role in this process, as it directly influences how information
is surfaced to users. While Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually
relevant content, fine-tuning these models for complex tasks like WPO presents
challenges. Specifically, the need for extensive human-annotated data to
mitigate issues such as hallucinations and model instability can be
prohibitively expensive, especially in large-scale systems that interact with
millions of items daily. In this work, we address the challenge of fine-tuning
LLMs for WPO by using user feedback as the supervision. Unlike manually labeled
datasets, user feedback is inherently noisy and less precise. To overcome this,
we propose a reward-based fine-tuning approach, PageLLM, which employs a
mixed-grained reward mechanism that combines page-level and item-level rewards.
The page-level reward evaluates the overall quality and coherence, while the
item-level reward focuses on the accuracy and relevance of key recommendations.
This dual-reward structure ensures that both the holistic presentation and the
critical individual components are optimized. We validate PageLLM on both
public and industrial datasets. PageLLM outperforms baselines and achieves a
0.44\% GMV increase in an online A/B test with over 10 million users,
demonstrating its real-world impact.

Conclusion: 结合LLM和ML的团队框架有效解决了特征转换的稳定性和有效性问题，并揭示了LLM对原始数据的理解能力。

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances data representation by deriving new features
from the original data. Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces
challenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation
(error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and
LLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax,
while ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap,
we propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's
gradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples
generation, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of
the teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search,
intending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space;
(3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the
teacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the
student LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation. The experiments on
various datasets show that the teaming policy can achieve 5\% improvement in
downstream performance while reducing nearly half of the error cases. The
results also demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the teaming policy.
Additionally, we also have exciting findings on LLMs' capacity to understand
the original data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策模型（如漂移扩散模型和泊松计数器模型）缺乏学习机制，且仅适用于参与者已具备类别知识的任务。本研究旨在填补认知模型与生物模型之间的鸿沟。

Method: 提出了一种基于多变量霍克斯过程的SNN模型，结合了学习机制，并通过耦合结果证明了其与传统模型的相似性。此外，设计了一项在线分类任务来验证模型预测。

Result: 证明了漂移扩散模型与泊松计数器模型的耦合关系，并展示了霍克斯网络如何通过局部学习规则生成特定漂移扩散模型。实验验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为将生物相关神经机制整合到认知模型中提供了重要进展，深化了对神经活动与行为关系的理解。

Abstract: In cognition, response times and choices in decision-making tasks are
commonly modeled using Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs), which describe the
accumulation of evidence for a decision as a stochastic process, specifically a
Brownian motion, with the drift rate reflecting the strength of the evidence.
In the same vein, the Poisson counter model describes the accumulation of
evidence as discrete events whose counts over time are modeled as Poisson
processes, and has a spiking neurons interpretation as these processes are used
to model neuronal activities. However, these models lack a learning mechanism
and are limited to tasks where participants have prior knowledge of the
categories. To bridge the gap between cognitive and biological models, we
propose a biologically plausible Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for
decision-making that incorporates a learning mechanism and whose neurons
activities are modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process. First, we show a
coupling result between the DDM and the Poisson counter model, establishing
that these two models provide similar categorizations and reaction times and
that the DDM can be approximated by spiking Poisson neurons. To go further, we
show that a particular DDM with correlated noise can be derived from a Hawkes
network of spiking neurons governed by a local learning rule. In addition, we
designed an online categorization task to evaluate the model predictions. This
work provides a significant step toward integrating biologically relevant
neural mechanisms into cognitive models, fostering a deeper understanding of
the relationship between neural activity and behavior.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决联邦学习中高通信开销和同步频率的问题，提升效率、可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用自适应通信调度和延迟权重补偿技术，减少同步频率和通信开销。

Result: 实验结果显示训练时间减少20-35%，通信开销降低30-40%，收敛轮次显著减少。

Conclusion: 增强的AdaBoost框架在多种FL场景中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of an enhanced asynchronous
AdaBoost framework for federated learning (FL), focusing on its application
across five distinct domains: computer vision on edge devices, blockchain-based
model transparency, on-device mobile personalization, IoT anomaly detection,
and federated healthcare diagnostics. The proposed algorithm incorporates
adaptive communication scheduling and delayed weight compensation to reduce
synchronization frequency and communication overhead while preserving or
improving model accuracy. We examine how these innovations improve
communication efficiency, scalability, convergence, and robustness in each
domain. Comparative metrics including training time, communication overhead,
convergence iterations, and classification accuracy are evaluated using data
and estimates derived from Oghlukyan's enhanced AdaBoost framework. Empirical
results show, for example, training time reductions on the order of 20-35% and
communication overhead reductions of 30-40% compared to baseline AdaBoost, with
convergence achieved in significantly fewer boosting rounds. Tables and charts
summarize these improvements by domain. Mathematical formulations of the
adaptive scheduling rule and error-driven synchronization thresholds are
provided. Overall, the enhanced AdaBoost exhibits markedly improved efficiency
and robustness across diverse FL scenarios, suggesting broad applicability of
the approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变分推断技术未考虑耦合指数族的曲率几何，限制了其在重尾分布（如广义帕累托和学生t分布）中的应用。

Method: 通过耦合自由能（等于倒概率的耦合证据下界）改进模型，设计耦合变分自编码器（CVAE），利用重尾潜在分布采样。

Result: 在CelebA图像重建中，CVAE的Wasserstein-2或Fréchet Inception Distance比VAE提高了3%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过耦合分布和成本函数，显著减少了训练样本中的异常值，同时提高了模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce an optimization framework for variational inference based on the
coupled free energy, extending variational inference techniques to account for
the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family. This family includes
important heavy-tailed distributions such as the generalized Pareto and the
Student's t. By leveraging the coupled free energy, which is equal to the
coupled evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the inverted probabilities, we improve
the accuracy and robustness of the learned model. The coupled generalization of
Fisher Information metric and the affine connection. The method is applied to
the design of a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). By using the coupling
for both the distributions and cost functions, the reconstruction metric is
derived to still be the mean-square average loss with modified constants. The
novelty comes from sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its
associated coupled probability, which has faster decaying tails. The result is
the ability to train a model with high penalties in the tails, while assuring
that the training samples have a reduced number of outliers. The Wasserstein-2
or Fr\'echet Inception Distance of the reconstructed CelebA images shows the
CVAE has a 3\% improvement over the VAE after 5 epochs of training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码生成上表现优异，但在生成硬件特定、架构感知和高性能的GPU代码方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出FSR框架，联合优化编译、功能正确性和运行时性能，通过实际GPU内核执行延迟验证。

Result: FSR增强的LLMs生成的内核在正确率上表现稳定，执行速度最高可达人工编写代码的179倍。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs与性能强化技术，有望自动化生成硬件特定、架构敏感和高性能的GPU程序。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
general-purpose code generation. However, generating the code which is deeply
hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for
massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore
the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs,
with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the
underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework
called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes
compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance,
which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by
actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach
enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA
code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the
characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA
kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our
results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness
rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general
human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These
findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance
reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific,
architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.

Motivation: 当前多任务学习模型合并方法主要关注域内性能，忽视了域外数据集的适用性。

Method: 通过构建显著性分数测量任务向量参数冗余度，生成掩码向量进行层间剪枝，保留预训练模型参数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了域外任务性能，同时保持了域内任务的能力。

Conclusion: LwPTV方法灵活且高效，可无缝集成现有模型合并方法，提升多任务学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) concurrently trains a model on diverse task
datasets to exploit common features, thereby improving overall performance
across the tasks. Recent studies have dedicated efforts to merging multiple
independent model parameters into a unified model for MTL, thus circumventing
the need for training data and expanding the scope of applicable scenarios of
MTL. However, current approaches to model merging predominantly concentrate on
enhancing performance within in-domain (ID) datasets, often overlooking their
efficacy on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. In this work, we proposed LwPTV
(Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the
redundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve
mask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task
vectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding
layer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly
integrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their
performance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
application of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD
performance while preserving the ability on ID tasks.

Result: 改进的奖励模型在RewardBench上表现更优，同时提升了DPO对齐策略和BON推理验证结果。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度信号和一致性正则化，显著提升了奖励模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs),
particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or
inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores
of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However,
since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the
reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response
trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization
on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation
probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response
trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate
across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward
learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an
intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes
with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards.
We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model,
improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward
model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned
policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification
results. Our code is provided in https://github.com/chaoyang101/ICRM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型中记忆与泛化的关系，以理解模型容量如何影响学习行为。

Method: 通过预训练容量受限的Transformer模型，在合成字符级任务上分别测试泛化和记忆能力。

Result: 小模型泛化能力强但记忆能力弱，大模型反之；中等容量模型倾向于记忆；联合训练时无模型能成功泛化。

Conclusion: 预训练可能固有地偏向某种学习模式，研究为小语言模型的设计提供了启示。

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language
models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the
two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by
pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on
two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization
(via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We
observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic
cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to
extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward
memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size)
succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may
intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these
dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model
capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the
design and deployment of small language models.

Result: FSL-Net能够高效且准确地定位特征偏移，适用于大规模高维数据。

Conclusion: FSL-Net为解决特征偏移定位问题提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature shifts between data sources are present in many applications
involving healthcare, biomedical, socioeconomic, financial, survey, and
multi-sensor data, among others, where unharmonized heterogeneous data sources,
noisy data measurements, or inconsistent processing and standardization
pipelines can lead to erroneous features. Localizing shifted features is
important to address the underlying cause of the shift and correct or filter
the data to avoid degrading downstream analysis. While many techniques can
detect distribution shifts, localizing the features originating them is still
challenging, with current solutions being either inaccurate or not scalable to
large and high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we introduce the Feature
Shift Localization Network (FSL-Net), a neural network that can localize
feature shifts in large and high-dimensional datasets in a fast and accurate
manner. The network, trained with a large number of datasets, learns to extract
the statistical properties of the datasets and can localize feature shifts from
previously unseen datasets and shifts without the need for re-training. The
code and ready-to-use trained model are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UPQ的渐进量化框架，用于将指令调优的大语言模型（LLM）从FP16量化到INT2，结合了块级后训练量化和蒸馏量化感知训练，实现了高性能的2-bit量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模的快速扩展，资源受限设备上的部署面临挑战，现有2-bit量化方法仅限于预训练模型，未扩展到指令调优模型。

Method: UPQ框架分两步：1）使用块级后训练量化（PTQ）将FP16模型量化到INT4；2）通过蒸馏量化感知训练（Distill-QAT）进一步量化到INT2，最小化广义Jensen-Shannon散度（JSD）。

Result: UPQ首次实现了开源指令调优LLM的INT2量化，无需专有数据，在MMLU和IFEval基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: UPQ为指令调优LLM的极低比特量化提供了有效解决方案，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: As the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) poses significant
challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices, there is growing
interest in extremely low-bit quantization, such as 2-bit. Although prior works
have shown that 2-bit large models are pareto-optimal over their 4-bit smaller
counterparts in both accuracy and latency, these advancements have been limited
to pre-trained LLMs and have not yet been extended to instruction-tuned models.
To bridge this gap, we propose Unified Progressive Quantization (UPQ)$-$a novel
progressive quantization framework (FP16$\rightarrow$INT4$\rightarrow$INT2)
that unifies block-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) with
distillation-based quantization-aware training (Distill-QAT) for INT2
instruction-tuned LLM quantization. UPQ first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned
models to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to significantly reduce the quantization
error introduced by subsequent INT2 quantization. Next, UPQ applies Distill-QAT
to enable INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs to generate responses consistent with
their original FP16 counterparts by minimizing the generalized Jensen-Shannon
divergence (JSD) between the two. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to demonstrate that UPQ can quantize open-source instruction-tuned LLMs
to INT2 without relying on proprietary post-training data, while achieving
state-of-the-art performances on MMLU and IFEval$-$two of the most
representative benchmarks for evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.

TL;DR: MetaTT是一个统一的Tensor Train适配器框架，用于预训练Transformer的全局低秩微调，相比LoRA参数更少且性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LoRA独立微调权重矩阵导致参数冗余的问题，提出共享TT分解的全局低秩微调方法。

Method: 使用单一共享TT分解所有Transformer子模块，通过索引结构轴（如层和矩阵类型）实现参数压缩。

Result: 在标准语言建模基准测试中，MetaTT参数显著减少，性能与LoRA相当甚至优于其他张量方法。

Conclusion: MetaTT通过TT分解和成熟优化方法，实现了高效、可扩展的多任务共享适配器设计。

Abstract: We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global
low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes
each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize
all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward
layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and
optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters
proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters
proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed
final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent
state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We
observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads
to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to
LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other
rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines
-- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we
find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT
naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the
core tensor.

Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that
enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its
pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains
challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text
descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a
hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical,
structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled
the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over
59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM
extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and
recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive
experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare
verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot
recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also
demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label
efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: CodeBrain为EEG建模提供了生物启发和可解释的方法，为未来神经科学研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides real-time insights into brain activity
and is widely used in neuroscience. However, variations in channel
configurations, sequence lengths, and task objectives limit the transferability
of traditional task-specific models. Although recent EEG foundation models
(EFMs) aim to learn generalizable representations, they struggle with limited
heterogeneous representation capacity and inefficiency in capturing multi-scale
brain dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose CodeBrain, an
efficient EFM structurally aligned with brain organization, trained in two
stages. (1) We introduce a TFDual-Tokenizer that independently tokenizes
heterogeneous temporal and frequency components, enabling a quadratic expansion
of the discrete representation space. This also offers a degree of
interpretability through cross-domain token analysis. (2) We propose the
EEGSSM, which combines a structured global convolution architecture and a
sliding window attention mechanism to jointly model sparse long-range and local
dependencies. Unlike fully connected Transformer models, EEGSSM better reflects
the brain's small-world topology and efficiently captures EEG's inherent
multi-scale structure. EEGSSM is trained with a masked self-supervised learning
objective to predict token indices obtained in TFDual-Tokenizer. Comprehensive
experiments on 10 public EEG datasets demonstrate the generalizability of
CodeBrain with linear probing. By offering biologically informed and
interpretable EEG modeling, CodeBrain lays the foundation for future
neuroscience research. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in
the future version.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态数据（如天气、医疗和能源领域）的普遍性需要有效的时间序列数据检索方法，现有方法缺乏语义基础且难以处理多模态对齐。

Method: 提出TRACE，通过文本上下文对齐时间序列嵌入，支持细粒度通道级对齐和硬负样本挖掘，实现跨模态检索。

Result: TRACE在下游预测和分类任务中达到最先进性能，同时作为通用检索器增强时间序列模型。

Conclusion: TRACE不仅是一个强大的检索器，还能作为独立编码器，为时间序列模型提供上下文感知表示。

Abstract: The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and
energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of
time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts,
such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval
essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust
time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite
the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored.
Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous
modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To
address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds
time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained
channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate
semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval
modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking
linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving
semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative
context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a
static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder,
with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware
representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These
representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting
and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains
highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream
applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.

Conclusion: BSA-TNP为神经过程模型提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于复杂和大规模应用。

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are a rapidly evolving class of models designed to
directly model the posterior predictive distribution of stochastic processes.
While early architectures were developed primarily as a scalable alternative to
Gaussian Processes (GPs), modern NPs tackle far more complex and data hungry
applications spanning geology, epidemiology, climate, and robotics. These
applications have placed increasing pressure on the scalability of these
models, with many architectures compromising accuracy for scalability. In this
paper, we demonstrate that this tradeoff is often unnecessary, particularly
when modeling fully or partially translation invariant processes. We propose a
versatile new architecture, the Biased Scan Attention Transformer Neural
Process (BSA-TNP), which introduces Kernel Regression Blocks (KRBlocks),
group-invariant attention biases, and memory-efficient Biased Scan Attention
(BSA). BSA-TNP is able to: (1) match or exceed the accuracy of the best models
while often training in a fraction of the time, (2) exhibit translation
invariance, enabling learning at multiple resolutions simultaneously, (3)

### [176] [Improving LLM Agent Planning with In-Context Learning via Atomic Fact Augmentation and Lookahead Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09171)

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型LLM代理框架，通过上下文学习增强规划能力，利用原子事实增强和递归前瞻搜索，无需微调即可提升多步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂交互环境中难以适应新信息或高效利用历史经验进行多步推理，需要改进。

Method: 通过原子事实增强和递归前瞻搜索，动态提取任务关键事实并用于动作提议、世界模型模拟和状态值估计。

Result: 代理在交互任务中表现出更高的性能和适应性，如TextFrozenLake和ALFWorld任务。

Conclusion: 该框架通过经验积累优化行为，证明了基于事实抽象和LLM模拟的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require
significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in
complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting
to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step
reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that
enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by
atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to
extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These
facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components
responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value
estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where
the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided
by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the
agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its
experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a
theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based
abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates
improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks,
achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in
tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

TL;DR: CuriosiTree是一种基于启发式的零样本信息获取策略，通过贪心树搜索平衡信息增益与成本，在临床诊断模拟中表现优于基线策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策者在信息不足时需选择成本效益高的信息获取方式。

Method: 提出CuriosiTree，使用贪心树搜索评估每个动作的预期信息增益，并基于信息增益与成本选择动作。

Result: 在临床诊断模拟中，CuriosiTree能有效整合异构信息源，诊断准确性优于基线策略。

Conclusion: CuriosiTree是一种高效且成本效益高的信息获取策略。

Abstract: Decision-makers often possess insufficient information to render a confident
decision. In these cases, the decision-maker can often undertake actions to
acquire the necessary information about the problem at hand, e.g., by
consulting knowledgeable authorities or by conducting experiments. Importantly,
different levers of information acquisition come with different costs, posing
the challenge of selecting the actions that are both informative and
cost-effective. In this work, we propose CuriosiTree, a heuristic-based,
test-time policy for zero-shot information acquisition in large language models
(LLMs). CuriosiTree employs a greedy tree search to estimate the expected
information gain of each action and strategically chooses actions based on a
balance of anticipated information gain and associated cost. Empirical
validation in a clinical diagnosis simulation shows that CuriosiTree enables
cost-effective integration of heterogenous sources of information, and
outperforms baseline action selection strategies in selecting action sequences
that enable accurate diagnosis.

*Chenheng Xu,Dan Wu,Yixin Zhu,Ying Nian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的时间序列预测方法FNF和DBD架构，解决了现有方法无法同时捕捉时间依赖性和空间相关性的问题，并在多个领域的数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要借用自然语言处理或计算机视觉的模型（如Transformer），未能充分考虑时间序列的独特性质（如周期性），缺乏专门针对时间序列的模型。

Method: 提出FNF作为骨干网络，结合DBD架构，统一处理局部时间域和全局频率域信息，并通过信息瓶颈理论优化梯度流和表示能力。

Result: 在11个公共基准数据集上验证了方法的优越性，无需辅助技术即可达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，设计合理的神经网络架构可以捕捉时间序列的固有特性，可能推动科学和工业应用中的时间序列建模。

Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the
challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial
correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly
repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g.,
Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time
series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone
with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic
backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition).
We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide
excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for
spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that
FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information
processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling,
while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior
gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or
sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark
datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation,
environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent
hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without
any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural
architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially
transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.

Conclusion: 新方法能更好地模拟人类决策的不确定性，适应性强。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feeback (RLHF) has become a key factor in
aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate
multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often
simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such
as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly
considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in
reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable
weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression
models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making
and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct
several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms
existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional
RL approaches.

TL;DR: LaDCast是一种基于潜在扩散模型的全球中期集合天气预报框架，通过潜在空间生成小时级集合预报，性能接近欧洲中期天气预报中心（IFS-ENS），且在极端事件（如气旋）跟踪上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报（NWP）和机器学习方法在高精度和高效不确定性量化方面存在挑战，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用自编码器压缩高维ERA5再分析数据，结合基于Transformer的扩散模型生成潜在更新，并引入GeoRoPE、双流注意力机制和正弦时间嵌入等技术。

Result: LaDCast在确定性和概率性预报技能上接近IFS-ENS，且在极端事件跟踪上表现更优，同时显著降低了计算和存储需求。

Conclusion: LaDCast为实时公里级分辨率天气预报提供了一条实用路径，并开源了代码和模型。

Abstract: Accurate probabilistic weather forecasting demands both high accuracy and
efficient uncertainty quantification, challenges that overburden both ensemble
numerical weather prediction (NWP) and recent machine-learning methods. We
introduce LaDCast, the first global latent-diffusion framework for medium-range
ensemble forecasting, which generates hourly ensemble forecasts entirely in a
learned latent space. An autoencoder compresses high-dimensional ERA5
reanalysis fields into a compact representation, and a transformer-based
diffusion model produces sequential latent updates with arbitrary hour
initialization. The model incorporates Geometric Rotary Position Embedding
(GeoRoPE) to account for the Earth's spherical geometry, a dual-stream
attention mechanism for efficient conditioning, and sinusoidal temporal
embeddings to capture seasonal patterns. LaDCast achieves deterministic and
probabilistic skill close to that of the European Centre for Medium-Range
Forecast IFS-ENS, without any explicit perturbations. Notably, LaDCast
demonstrates superior performance in tracking rare extreme events such as
cyclones, capturing their trajectories more accurately than established models.
By operating in latent space, LaDCast reduces storage and compute by orders of
magnitude, demonstrating a practical path toward forecasting at kilometer-scale
resolution in real time. We open-source our code and models and provide the
training and evaluation pipelines at: https://github.com/tonyzyl/ladcast.

TL;DR: FLoRIST是一种联邦学习框架，通过低秩适应（LoRA）高效微调大型语言模型，解决了通信效率、模型准确性和计算成本之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦LoRA方法在通信效率、模型准确性和计算成本之间存在挑战，尤其是在异构客户端环境中。

Method: FLoRIST通过单独对堆叠的本地适配器进行奇异值分解，在紧凑的中间空间中表示信息，并引入可调奇异值阈值选择最优秩，构建全局低秩适配器。

Result: FLoRIST在多种数据集和LLM上表现出色，在通信效率和性能之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: FLoRIST为联邦学习中的高效微调提供了一种有效解决方案，适用于异构和同构环境。

Abstract: Integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into federated learning offers a
promising solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs) without sharing local data. However, several methods designed for
federated LoRA present significant challenges in balancing communication
efficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, particularly among
heterogeneous clients. These methods either rely on simplistic averaging of
local adapters, which introduces aggregation noise, require transmitting large
stacked local adapters, leading to poor communication efficiency, or
necessitate reconstructing memory-dense global weight-update matrix and
performing computationally expensive decomposition to design client-specific
low-rank adapters. In this work, we propose FLoRIST, a federated fine-tuning
framework that achieves mathematically accurate aggregation without incurring
high communication or computational overhead. Instead of constructing the full
global weight-update matrix at the server, FLoRIST employs an efficient
decomposition pipeline by performing singular value decomposition on stacked
local adapters separately. This approach operates within a compact intermediate
space to represent the accumulated information from local LoRAs. We introduce
tunable singular value thresholding for server-side optimal rank selection to
construct a pair of global low-rank adapters shared by all clients. Extensive
empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate that
FLoRIST consistently strikes the best balance between superior communication
efficiency and competitive performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous
setups.

methods, offering a simple and intuitive interface and a seamless conversion
from centralized to federated training tasks. FedRAG is also deeply integrated

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务：从离线强化学习数据集中聚类轨迹，每个聚类中心代表生成轨迹的策略。通过KL散度和策略诱导分布的混合，提出了聚类目标，并提出了PG-Kmeans和CAAE两种方法。理论证明了PG-Kmeans的收敛性，并指出离线轨迹聚类的挑战。实验验证了方法的有效性。

Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集中轨迹的聚类有助于理解策略生成的行为模式，但现有方法未充分探索策略与轨迹分布的关系。

Method: 提出了PG-Kmeans（基于行为克隆策略迭代聚类）和CAAE（类似VQ-VAE的框架，引导潜在表示聚类）。

Result: 在D4RL数据集和GridWorld环境中验证了方法的有效性，能够将轨迹划分为有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: PG-Kmeans和CAAE为基于策略的轨迹聚类提供了有效框架，适用于离线强化学习及其他领域。

Abstract: We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline
reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the
policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between
the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of
policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To
solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted
Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies
and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE
resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of
trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve
clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans
and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent
ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can
result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings.
Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and
custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE
effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a
promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad
applications in offline RL and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LaSDI方法在复杂或高频数据下难以同时满足数据重建和潜在空间动力学的要求，需要改进。

Result: mLaSDI在预测和重建误差上表现更优，同时减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: mLaSDI是一种高效且准确的降阶模型方法，适用于复杂或高频数据场景。

Abstract: Determining accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) is an important task in many scientific disciplines. However, solvers
can be computationally expensive, leading to the development of reduced-order
models (ROMs). Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was
proposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the
training data using an autoencoder and learns a system of user-chosen ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), which govern the latent space dynamics. This
allows for rapid predictions by interpolating and evolving the low-dimensional
ODEs in the latent space. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous
problems, the autoencoder can have difficulty accurately reconstructing
training data while also satisfying the imposed dynamics in the latent space,
particularly in complex or high-frequency regimes. To address this, we propose
multi-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, several
autoencoders are trained sequentially in stages, where each autoencoder learns
to correct the error of the previous stages. We find that applying mLaSDI with
small autoencoders results in lower prediction and reconstruction errors, while
also reducing training time compared to LaSDI.

Conclusion: 自适应池化方法在信号噪声比波动时表现更稳健，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We investigate the design of pooling methods used to summarize the outputs of
transformer embedding models, primarily motivated by reinforcement learning and
vision applications. This work considers problems where a subset of the input
vectors contains requisite information for a downstream task (signal) while the
rest are distractors (noise). By framing pooling as vector quantization with
the goal of minimizing signal loss, we demonstrate that the standard methods
used to aggregate transformer outputs, AvgPool, MaxPool, and ClsToken, are
vulnerable to performance collapse as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inputs
fluctuates. We then show that an attention-based adaptive pooling method can
approximate the signal-optimal vector quantizer within derived error bounds for
any SNR. Our theoretical results are first validated by supervised experiments
on a synthetic dataset designed to isolate the SNR problem, then generalized to
standard relational reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and vision
benchmarks with noisy observations, where transformers with adaptive pooling
display superior robustness across tasks.

Result: 发现许多遗忘方法实际为行为抑制，提出真实移除的必要性与可行性问题，并指出评估与实践挑战。

Conclusion: 为生成AI中的遗忘技术提供了全面框架，支持未来研究与数据隐私政策制定。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical topic in machine
learning, aiming to eliminate the influence of specific training data or
knowledge without retraining the model from scratch. A variety of techniques
have been proposed, including Gradient Ascent, model editing, and re-steering
hidden representations. While existing surveys often organize these methods by
their technical characteristics, such classifications tend to overlook a more
fundamental dimension: the underlying intention of unlearning--whether it seeks
to truly remove internal knowledge or merely suppress its behavioral effects.
In this SoK paper, we propose a new taxonomy based on this intention-oriented
perspective. Building on this taxonomy, we make three key contributions. First,
we revisit recent findings suggesting that many removal methods may
functionally behave like suppression, and explore whether true removal is
necessary or achievable. Second, we survey existing evaluation strategies,
identify limitations in current metrics and benchmarks, and suggest directions
for developing more reliable and intention-aligned evaluations. Third, we
highlight practical challenges--such as scalability and support for sequential
unlearning--that currently hinder the broader deployment of unlearning methods.
In summary, this work offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and
advancing unlearning in generative AI, aiming to support future research and
guide policy decisions around data removal and privacy.

Conclusion: MindRAG通过LLM驱动的推理代理和多模态RAG技术，有效解决了工业CM系统中的实际问题，提升了自动化决策的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Condition monitoring (CM) plays a crucial role in ensuring reliability and
efficiency in the process industry. Although computerised maintenance systems
effectively detect and classify faults, tasks like fault severity estimation,
and maintenance decisions still largely depend on human expert analysis. The
analysis and decision making automatically performed by current systems
typically exhibit considerable uncertainty and high false alarm rates, leading
to increased workload and reduced efficiency.
  This work integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning agents with
CM workflows to address analyst and industry needs, namely reducing false
alarms, enhancing fault severity estimation, improving decision support, and
offering explainable interfaces. We propose MindRAG, a modular framework
combining multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with novel vector
store structures designed specifically for CM data. The framework leverages
existing annotations and maintenance work orders as surrogates for labels in a
supervised learning protocol, addressing the common challenge of training
predictive models on unlabelled and noisy real-world datasets.
  The primary contributions include: (1) an approach for structuring industry
CM data into a semi-structured multimodal vector store compatible with
LLM-driven workflows; (2) developing multimodal RAG techniques tailored for CM
data; (3) developing practical reasoning agents capable of addressing
real-world CM queries; and (4) presenting an experimental framework for
integrating and evaluating such agents in realistic industrial scenarios.
Preliminary results, evaluated with the help of an experienced analyst,
indicate that MindRAG provide meaningful decision support for more efficient
management of alarms, thereby improving the interpretability of CM systems.

Abstract: We introduce conditional flow matching for imputation (CFMI), a new
general-purpose method to impute missing data. The method combines continuous
normalising flows, flow-matching, and shared conditional modelling to deal with
intractabilities of traditional multiple imputation. Our comparison with nine
classical and state-of-the-art imputation methods on 24 small to
moderate-dimensional tabular data sets shows that CFMI matches or outperforms
both traditional and modern techniques across a wide range of metrics. Applying
the method to zero-shot imputation of time-series data, we find that it matches
the accuracy of a related diffusion-based method while outperforming it in
terms of computational efficiency. Overall, CFMI performs at least as well as
traditional methods on lower-dimensional data while remaining scalable to
high-dimensional settings, matching or exceeding the performance of other deep
learning-based approaches, making it a go-to imputation method for a wide range
of data types and dimensionalities.

Motivation: 传统基于时序差分误差的优先经验回放容易受噪声干扰，类似于探索中的噪声电视问题，因此需要一种更鲁棒的优先策略。

Result: 在表格模型和Atari游戏中验证了方法的有效性，性能优于分位数回归DQN基准。

Conclusion: 认知不确定性优先回放为强化学习提供了一种有效的噪声抑制策略。

Abstract: Prioritized experience replay, which improves sample efficiency by selecting
relevant transitions to update parameter estimates, is a crucial component of
contemporary value-based deep reinforcement learning models. Typically,
transitions are prioritized based on their temporal difference error. However,
this approach is prone to favoring noisy transitions, even when the value
estimation closely approximates the target mean. This phenomenon resembles the
noisy TV problem postulated in the exploration literature, in which
exploration-guided agents get stuck by mistaking noise for novelty. To mitigate
the disruptive effects of noise in value estimation, we propose using epistemic
uncertainty estimation to guide the prioritization of transitions from the
replay buffer. Epistemic uncertainty quantifies the uncertainty that can be
reduced by learning, hence reducing transitions sampled from the buffer
generated by unpredictable random processes. We first illustrate the benefits
of epistemic uncertainty prioritized replay in two tabular toy models: a simple
multi-arm bandit task, and a noisy gridworld. Subsequently, we evaluate our
prioritization scheme on the Atari suite, outperforming quantile regression
deep Q-learning benchmarks; thus forging a path for the use of uncertainty
prioritized replay in reinforcement learning agents.

comparisons. A central challenge in this setting is to design algorithms that
select informative preference queries to identify the underlying reward while
ensuring theoretical guarantees. We propose a meta-algorithm based on
randomized exploration, which avoids the computational challenges associated
with optimistic approaches and remains tractable. We establish both regret and
last-iterate guarantees under mild reinforcement learning oracle assumptions.
To improve query complexity, we introduce and analyze an improved algorithm
that collects batches of trajectory pairs and applies optimal experimental
design to select informative comparison queries. The batch structure also
enables parallelization of preference queries, which is relevant in practical
deployment as feedback can be gathered concurrently. Empirical evaluation
confirms that the proposed method is competitive with reward-based
reinforcement learning while requiring a small number of preference queries.

Conclusion: G-Sim通过结合领域先验和实证证据，解决了数据效率低的问题，支持复杂决策。

Abstract: Constructing robust simulators is essential for asking "what if?" questions
and guiding policy in critical domains like healthcare and logistics. However,
existing methods often struggle, either failing to generalize beyond historical
data or, when using Large Language Models (LLMs), suffering from inaccuracies
and poor empirical alignment. We introduce G-Sim, a hybrid framework that
automates simulator construction by synergizing LLM-driven structural design
with rigorous empirical calibration. G-Sim employs an LLM in an iterative loop
to propose and refine a simulator's core components and causal relationships,
guided by domain knowledge. This structure is then grounded in reality by
estimating its parameters using flexible calibration techniques. Specifically,
G-Sim can leverage methods that are both likelihood-free and gradient-free with
respect to the simulator, such as gradient-free optimization for direct
parameter estimation or simulation-based inference for obtaining a posterior
distribution over parameters. This allows it to handle non-differentiable and
stochastic simulators. By integrating domain priors with empirical evidence,
G-Sim produces reliable, causally-informed simulators, mitigating
data-inefficiency and enabling robust system-level interventions for complex
decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出一种仅从状态轨迹学习的MDP状态表示框架，无需奖励信号或动作信息，通过最小动作距离（MAD）捕捉环境结构，支持下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖奖励或动作信息，限制了应用范围。目标是开发一种自监督学习框架，仅需状态轨迹即可学习环境结构。

Method: 提出最小动作距离（MAD）作为核心度量，构建嵌入空间，使嵌入距离对应MAD，支持对称和非对称近似。

Conclusion: MAD框架能高效学习准确的状态表示，适用于多样化环境，为下游任务提供有力支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision
processes (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring
neither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose
learning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of
actions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that
captures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables
critical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and
reward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of
progress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space
where the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD,
accommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the
framework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values,
encompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete
and continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently
learns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also
significantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of
representation quality.

Abstract: Objective: To characterize stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral
circumstances in people living with HIV (PLWHs) seeking care, using natural
language processing methods applied to a large collection of electronic health
record (EHR) clinical notes from a large integrated health system in the
southeast United States. Methods: We identified 9,140 cohort of PLWHs from the
UF Health IDR and performed topic modeling analysis using Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) to uncover stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral
circumstances. Domain experts created a seed list of HIV-related stigma
keywords, then applied a snowball strategy to iteratively review notes for
additional terms until saturation was reached. To identify more target topics,
we tested three keyword-based filtering strategies. Domain experts manually
reviewed the detected topics using the prevalent terms and key discussion
topics. Word frequency analysis was used to highlight the prevalent terms
associated with each topic. In addition, we conducted topic variation analysis
among subgroups to examine differences across age and sex-specific
demographics. Results and Conclusion: Topic modeling on sentences containing at
least one keyword uncovered a wide range of topic themes associated with
HIV-related stigma, social, and related behaviors circumstances, including
"Mental Health Concern and Stigma", "Social Support and Engagement", "Limited
Healthcare Access and Severe Illness", "Treatment Refusal and Isolation" and so
on. Topic variation analysis across age subgroups revealed differences.
Extracting and understanding the HIV-related stigma dimensions, social, and
related behavioral circumstances from EHR clinical notes enables scalable,
time-efficient assessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional
questionnaires and improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents
significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not
match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally
possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling
(i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our
research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling
in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive
outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set
programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies
the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of
possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to
leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding
a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional
approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical
structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established
methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a
meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12%
improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in
terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled
time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of
sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for
higher rates of sub-sampling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双状态线性注意力（DSLA）和自适应蒸馏框架（Serve），以解决长输入下LLMs的计算和内存成本问题，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决线性注意力方法在长输入下因过度关注近期token而导致的准确性下降问题。

Method: 提出DSLA，通过维护两个隐藏状态（历史上下文和近期性）来缓解线性注意力的短程偏差；引入Serve框架，动态替换Transformer层为DSLA层，并使用链式微调策略。

Result: Serve比Llama2-7B快2.3倍，比Zamba-7B快3.0倍，同时在下游任务中保持可比性能。

Conclusion: DSLA和Serve在效率和准确性之间取得了平衡，解决了线性注意力中历史token表示不足的问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via
self-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs.
While sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs,
they often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work,
we first propose \textit{dual-state linear attention} (\textbf{\dsla}), a novel
design that maintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving
historical context and one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the
short-range bias typical of linear-attention architectures. To further balance
efficiency and accuracy under dynamic workload conditions, we introduce
\textbf{\serve}, an online \textit{adaptive distillation} framework that
progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference time,
guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering. \serve\ uses a chained
fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly converted DSLA layer remains
consistent with previously replaced layers, preserving the overall quality.
Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning, long-context QA, and text
summarization demonstrate that \serve\ yields \textbf{2.3x} faster inference
than Llama2-7B and \textbf{3.0x} faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while
retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies
show that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies,
addressing the historical-token underrepresentation seen in prior linear
attentions. Codes are available at https://github.com/utnslab/DSLA-Serve.

Conclusion: InstructPro能够根据自然语言指令生成功能一致的蛋白质序列，为蛋白质设计提供了高效的新方法。

Abstract: Can AI protein models follow human language instructions and design proteins
with desired functions (e.g. binding to a ligand)? Designing proteins that bind
to a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and
chemistry. Most prior AI models are trained on protein-ligand complex data,
which is scarce due to the high cost and time requirements of laboratory
experiments. In contrast, there is a substantial body of human-curated text
descriptions about protein-ligand interactions and ligand formula. In this
paper, we propose InstructPro, a family of protein generative models that
follow natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins. Given a
textual description of the desired function and a ligand formula in SMILES,
InstructPro generates protein sequences that are functionally consistent with
the specified instructions. We develop the model architecture, training
strategy, and a large-scale dataset, InstructProBench, to support both training
and evaluation. InstructProBench consists of 9,592,829 triples of (function
description, ligand formula, protein sequence). We train two model variants:
InstructPro-1B (with 1 billion parameters) and InstructPro-3B~(with 3 billion
parameters). Both variants consistently outperform strong baselines, including
ProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal. Notably, InstructPro-1B achieves the highest docking
success rate (81.52% at moderate confidence) and the lowest average root mean
square deviation (RMSD) compared to ground truth structures (4.026{\AA}).
InstructPro-3B further descreases the average RMSD to 2.527{\AA}, demonstrating
InstructPro's ability to generate ligand-binding proteins that align with the
functional specifications.

Conclusion: ErrorEraser通过主动消除错误记忆，提升了持续学习的性能，为处理数据偏差提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) primarily aims to retain knowledge to prevent
catastrophic forgetting and transfer knowledge to facilitate learning new
tasks. Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only
needs to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This
arises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the
model to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks.
From feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases
simultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address
this, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous
memories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old
tasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error
Erasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in
the feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of
potentially biased samples. The latter ensures only erroneous knowledge is
erased by shifting the decision space of representative outlier samples.
Additionally, an incremental feature distribution learning strategy is designed
to reduce the resource overhead during error identification in downstream
tasks. Extensive experimental results show that ErrorEraser significantly
mitigates the negative impact of data biases, achieving higher accuracy and
lower forgetting rates across three types of CL methods. The code is available
at https://github.com/diadai/ErrorEraser.

Abstract: A central concern in classification is the vulnerability of machine learning
models to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is one of the most popular
techniques for training robust classifiers, which involves minimizing an
adversarial surrogate risk. Recent work characterized when a minimizing
sequence of an adversarial surrogate risk is also a minimizing sequence of the
adversarial classification risk for binary classification -- a property known
as adversarial consistency. However, these results do not address the rate at
which the adversarial classification risk converges to its optimal value for
such a sequence of functions that minimize the adversarial surrogate. This
paper provides surrogate risk bounds that quantify that convergence rate.
Additionally, we derive distribution-dependent surrogate risk bounds in the
standard (non-adversarial) learning setting, that may be of independent
interest.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including
cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by
identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in
real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion
models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn
complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a
robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review
anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a
tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical
implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and
multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly
detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent
synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where
generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly
data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve
generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their
individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on
anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs,
analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges
including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising
future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and
integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large
language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research
questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical
User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful
intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods
in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face
substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive
positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often
fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their
utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a
novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction
preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by
focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic
location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying
importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI
environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results
across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will
be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

Motivation: 扩散蒸馏技术通常需要大量训练且学生模型性能下降，GAN目标可能缓解这一问题，但其机制尚不明确。

Conclusion: 扩散训练可视为生成预训练过程，为构建高效一步生成模型提供新视角。

Abstract: Diffusion distillation is a widely used technique to reduce the sampling cost
of diffusion models, yet it often requires extensive training, and the student
performance tends to be degraded. Recent studies show that incorporating a GAN
objective may alleviate these issues, yet the underlying mechanism remains
unclear. In this work, we first identify a key limitation of distillation:
mismatched step sizes and parameter numbers between the teacher and the student
model lead them to converge to different local minima, rendering direct
imitation suboptimal. We further demonstrate that a standalone GAN objective,
without relying a distillation loss, overcomes this limitation and is
sufficient to convert diffusion models into efficient one-step generators.
Based on this finding, we propose that diffusion training may be viewed as a
form of generative pre-training, equipping models with capabilities that can be
unlocked through lightweight GAN fine-tuning. Supporting this view, we create a
one-step generation model by fine-tuning a pre-trained model with 85% of
parameters frozen, achieving strong performance with only 0.2M images and
near-SOTA results with 5M images. We further present a frequency-domain
analysis that may explain the one-step generative capability gained in
diffusion training. Overall, our work provides a new perspective for diffusion
training, highlighting its role as a powerful generative pre-training process,
which can be the basis for building efficient one-step generation models.

Abstract: We consider the task of predicting Hamiltonian matrices to accelerate
electronic structure calculations, which plays an important role in physics,
chemistry, and materials science. Motivated by the inherent relationship
between the off-diagonal blocks of the Hamiltonian matrix and the SO(2) local
frame, we propose a novel and efficient network, called QHNetV2, that achieves
global SO(3) equivariance without the costly SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan tensor
products. This is achieved by introducing a set of new efficient and powerful
SO(2)-equivariant operations and performing all off-diagonal feature updates
and message passing within SO(2) local frames, thereby eliminating the need of
SO(3) tensor products. Moreover, a continuous SO(2) tensor product is performed
within the SO(2) local frame at each node to fuse node features, mimicking the
symmetric contraction operation. Extensive experiments on the large QH9 and
MD17 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance across a
wide range of molecular structures and trajectories, highlighting its strong
generalization capability. The proposed SO(2) operations on SO(2) local frames
offer a promising direction for scalable and symmetry-aware learning of
electronic structures. Our code will be released as part of the AIRS library

Conclusion: CAPT能有效减少预训练偏差，提升模型的泛化能力和样本效率。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in language modeling, recent studies reveal that they often fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples due to spurious correlations acquired during
pre-training. Here, we aim to mitigate such spurious correlations through
causality-aware post-training (CAPT). By decomposing a biased prediction into
two unbiased steps, known as \textit{event estimation} and \textit{event
intervention}, we reduce LLMs' pre-training biases without incurring additional
fine-tuning biases, thus enhancing the model's generalization ability.
Experiments on the formal causal inference benchmark CLadder and the logical
reasoning dataset PrOntoQA show that 3B-scale language models fine-tuned with
CAPT can outperform both traditional SFT and larger LLMs on in-distribution
(ID) and OOD tasks using only 100 ID fine-tuning samples, demonstrating the
effectiveness and sample efficiency of CAPT.

Abstract: Decentralized learning, which facilitates joint model training across
geographically scattered agents, has gained significant attention in the field
of signal and information processing in recent years. While the optimization
errors of decentralized learning algorithms have been extensively studied,
their generalization errors remain relatively under-explored. As the
generalization errors reflect the scalability of trained models on unseen data
and are crucial in determining the performance of trained models in real-world
applications, understanding the generalization errors of decentralized learning
is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present fine-grained
generalization error analysis for both attack-free and Byzantine-resilient
decentralized learning with heterogeneous data as well as under mild
assumptions, in contrast to prior studies that consider homogeneous data and/or
rely on a stringent bounded stochastic gradient assumption. Our results shed
light on the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization and stochastic
gradient noise -- factors that have not been closely investigated before -- on
the generalization error of decentralized learning. We also reveal that
Byzantine attacks performed by malicious agents largely affect the
generalization error, and their negative impact is inherently linked to the
data heterogeneity while remaining independent on the sample size. Numerical
experiments on both convex and non-convex tasks are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

### [206] [Safe Screening Rules for Group SLOPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09451)
*Runxue Bao,Quanchao Lu,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对Group SLOPE模型的安全筛选规则，用于高效识别无效特征组，显著提升计算效率和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Group SLOPE中块不可分组效应导致的计算成本高和内存占用大的问题。

Method: 设计了一种安全筛选规则，识别并排除无效特征组，适用于批量和随机算法。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效检测无效组，显著提升效率且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的筛选规则安全可靠，能显著优化Group SLOPE的计算性能。

Abstract: Variable selection is a challenging problem in high-dimensional sparse
learning, especially when group structures exist. Group SLOPE performs well for
the adaptive selection of groups of predictors. However, the block
non-separable group effects in Group SLOPE make existing methods either invalid
or inefficient. Consequently, Group SLOPE tends to incur significant
computational costs and memory usage in practical high-dimensional scenarios.
To overcome this issue, we introduce a safe screening rule tailored for the
Group SLOPE model, which efficiently identifies inactive groups with zero
coefficients by addressing the block non-separable group effects. By excluding
these inactive groups during training, we achieve considerable gains in
computational efficiency and memory usage. Importantly, the proposed screening
rule can be seamlessly integrated into existing solvers for both batch and
stochastic algorithms. Theoretically, we establish that our screening rule can
be safely employed with existing optimization algorithms, ensuring the same
results as the original approaches. Experimental results confirm that our
method effectively detects inactive feature groups and significantly boosts
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Stained Glass Transform的方法，通过随机变换LLM的词嵌入来保护输入数据的隐私，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI计算基础设施的高成本和LLM服务的共享性，企业数据所有者对在共享环境中使用敏感数据存在顾虑。

Method: 提出Stained Glass Transform，一种基于高斯混合模型互信息的随机变换方法，保护输入隐私。

Result: 通过理论和实验验证，该方法在保护隐私的同时保持了LLM的性能。

Conclusion: Stained Glass Transform为共享计算环境中的隐私保护提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: The high cost of ownership of AI compute infrastructure and challenges of
robust serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in managed
Model-as-a-service deployments. Even when enterprises choose on-premises
deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams
in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed
models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow
their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute
infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data
being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of
deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned,
stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an
LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM
while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular
class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of
Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based
on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of
transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM
performance benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax Loss在大规模对象空间中存在显著的计算开销和扩展性限制，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过泰勒展开Softmax Loss，提出RG²和RG×两种损失函数，并结合ALS优化方法。

Result: 实验证明，新方法在排名性能上与Softmax Loss相当或更优，同时显著加速收敛。

Conclusion: 该框架为相似性学习提供了理论见解和高效工具，适用于需要平衡排名质量和计算效率的任务。

Abstract: Ranking tasks constitute fundamental components of extreme similarity
learning frameworks, where extremely large corpora of objects are modeled
through relative similarity relationships adhering to predefined ordinal
structures. Among various ranking surrogates, Softmax (SM) Loss has been widely
adopted due to its natural capability to handle listwise ranking via global
negative comparisons, along with its flexibility across diverse application
scenarios. However, despite its effectiveness, SM Loss often suffers from
significant computational overhead and scalability limitations when applied to
large-scale object spaces. To address this challenge, we propose novel loss
formulations that align directly with ranking metrics: the
Ranking-Generalizable \textbf{squared} (RG$^2$) Loss and the
Ranking-Generalizable interactive (RG$^\times$) Loss, both derived through
Taylor expansions of the SM Loss. Notably, RG$^2$ reveals the intrinsic
mechanisms underlying weighted squared losses (WSL) in ranking methods and
uncovers fundamental connections between sampling-based and non-sampling-based
loss paradigms. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed RG losses with the
highly efficient Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method, providing
both generalization guarantees and convergence rate analyses. Empirical
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable or superior ranking performance relative to SM Loss, while
significantly accelerating convergence. This framework offers the similarity
learning community both theoretical insights and practically efficient tools,
with methodologies applicable to a broad range of tasks where balancing ranking
quality and computational efficiency is essential.

Motivation: 发现开源项目和论文中KL散度梯度估计的实现存在误区，影响训练效果。

Result: 错误实现无法生成正确的KL梯度，部分实现仅提供部分梯度。

Conclusion: 论文明确了KL梯度估计的正确实现方式，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Abstract: We point out a few pitfalls in implementing gradient estimation for KL
divergence in RL training for LLM, as seen in a number of open source projects
and papers. The first major pitfall is to differentiate through the KL estimate
as loss functions to minimize KL divergence. We show that such implementations
are generally incorrect and do not produce the desired KL gradient. Secondly,
we show that some implementations do not account for the sequential nature of
the estimation problem and produce a partial gradient at best. We demonstrate
the impact of such issues with illustrative tabular and LLM experiments, and
show the correct way to implement the KL gradient.

TL;DR: EnerBridge-DPO是一种新型蛋白质逆折叠框架，通过结合Markov Bridges和Direct Preference Optimization（DPO），直接生成低能量、高稳定性的蛋白质序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法主要关注序列恢复率，而忽略了生成序列的能量稳定性。本研究旨在克服这一限制，开发能够直接生成低能量稳定序列的模型。

Method: 提出EnerBridge-DPO框架，结合Markov Bridges和DPO，引入能量约束损失，从信息丰富的先验序列出发优化生成低能量序列。

Result: EnerBridge-DPO能够设计出能量更低且序列恢复率与现有模型相当的蛋白质序列，并能准确预测序列间的ΔΔG值。

Conclusion: EnerBridge-DPO在蛋白质逆折叠中实现了能量稳定性和序列恢复率的平衡，为蛋白质设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Designing protein sequences with optimal energetic stability is a key
challenge in protein inverse folding, as current deep learning methods are
primarily trained by maximizing sequence recovery rates, often neglecting the
energy of the generated sequences. This work aims to overcome this limitation
by developing a model that directly generates low-energy, stable protein
sequences. We propose EnerBridge-DPO, a novel inverse folding framework focused
on generating low-energy, high-stability protein sequences. Our core innovation
lies in: First, integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), where energy-based preferences are used to fine-tune the Markov Bridge
model. The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior
sequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence
candidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which
enhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the
model to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior
knowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing
quantitative features of the energy landscape. Our evaluations demonstrate that
EnerBridge-DPO can design protein complex sequences with lower energy while
maintaining sequence recovery rates comparable to state-of-the-art models, and
accurately predicts $\Delta \Delta G$ values between various sequences.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs)，用于无奖励马尔可夫决策过程，通过状态-时间选项核（STOK）直接优化预测映射，以实现目标完成概率最大化并避免约束违反。STOK具有模块化、可组合和可解释性，支持长期规划和内在动机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于奖励最大化的方法在组合性、模块化和可解释性方面存在冲突，OKBEs旨在解决这些问题，支持可验证的长期规划和动态高维世界模型。

Method: 通过构造和优化STOK，利用Chapman-Kolmogorov方程进行时空预测，分解高维状态转移模型为局部STOK和目标条件策略，实现高效规划和任务复用。

Result: OKBEs支持灵活的策略合成、规划表示复用，并通过内在动机函数（如empowerment）验证目标合理性，适用于高维动态环境。

Conclusion: OKBEs提供了一种替代奖励最大化的方法，强调组合性、模块化和可解释性，为长期规划和内在动机提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs) for a new reward-free
Markov Decision Process. Rather than a value function, OKBEs directly construct
and optimize a predictive map called a state-time option kernel (STOK) to
maximize the probability of completing a goal while avoiding constraint
violations. STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable
initiation-to-termination transition kernels for policies in the Options
Framework of Reinforcement Learning. This means: 1) STOKs can be composed using
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to make spatiotemporal predictions for multiple
policies over long horizons, 2) high-dimensional STOKs can be represented and
computed efficiently in a factorized and reconfigurable form, and 3) STOKs
record the probabilities of semantically interpretable goal-success and
constraint-violation events, needed for formal verification. Given a
high-dimensional state-transition model for an intractable planning problem, we
can decompose it with local STOKs and goal-conditioned policies that are
aggregated into a factorized goal kernel, making it possible to forward-plan at
the level of goals in high-dimensions to solve the problem. These properties
lead to highly flexible agents that can rapidly synthesize meta-policies, reuse
planning representations across many tasks, and justify goals using
empowerment, an intrinsic motivation function. We argue that
reward-maximization is in conflict with the properties of compositionality,
modularity, and interpretability. Alternatively, OKBEs facilitate these
properties to support verifiable long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation
that scales to dynamic high-dimensional world-models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于坐标的多层感知机（MLPs）在学习连续神经表示时存在过拟合和外推能力不足的问题，尤其是对周期性信号。

Method: 提出了一种新型网络架构，通过提取周期性模式并利用这些信息来表示信号。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在周期性微分方程解、时间序列插补和预测等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了周期性信号的泛化能力和外推性能，适用于多种实际任务。

Abstract: As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective
tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its
corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural
representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in
learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of
overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting
in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the
underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or
temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic
patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the
signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation
performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through
comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for
differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and
forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动标注方法（如蒙特卡洛估计）产生噪声标签且计算成本高，需高效生成高质量过程标注数据。

Method: 利用弱与强完成者预测一致性识别可靠过程标签，并采用ORM初始化和负数据上采样策略优化PRM性能。

Result: Athena-PRM在多个场景和基准测试中表现优异，仅需5000样本，显著提升模型性能（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B在WeMath和MathVista上分别提升10.2和7.1分）。

Conclusion: Athena-PRM在多任务中表现卓越，成为视觉过程评估的新标杆，并通过奖励排序微调进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to
evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems.
Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and
financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations
of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte
Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial
computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data,
we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers
as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM
demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks
with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies
to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for
negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios:
verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step
correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently
achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios.
Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances
performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time
scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in
VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score,
showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the
reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we
develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with
a significant margin on five benchmarks.

TL;DR: STOAT是一个新颖的空间-时间概率因果推理网络框架，用于空间-时间因果时间序列的概率预测，通过结合空间关系矩阵和深度概率模型，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立建模空间和时间动态，并忽略因果驱动的概率预测，限制了预测能力。

Method: STOAT扩展了因果推理方法，引入空间关系矩阵编码区域间依赖关系，并通过深度概率模型估计分布参数，支持多种输出分布。

Result: 在COVID-19数据上的实验表明，STOAT在关键指标上优于现有模型，尤其在空间依赖强的区域表现突出。

Conclusion: STOAT通过结合因果推理和地理空间概率预测，为复杂空间-时间任务提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal
observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across
geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and
temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic
forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT
(Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework
for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal
inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes
interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially
informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by
deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions,
enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output
distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture
region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries
demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting
models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics,
particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal
inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a
generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic
management.

Result: 在28个任务上验证了MOORL的有效性，性能优于现有离线与混合RL方法。

Conclusion: MOORL通过简单设计实现了高效学习，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Sample efficiency and exploration remain critical challenges in Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), particularly in complex domains. Offline RL,
which enables agents to learn optimal policies from static, pre-collected
datasets, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, offline RL is
constrained by issues such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions that limit
policy performance and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Meta Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning (MOORL), a hybrid framework
that unifies offline and online RL for efficient and scalable learning. While
previous hybrid methods rely on extensive design components and added
computational complexity to utilize offline data effectively, MOORL introduces
a meta-policy that seamlessly adapts across offline and online trajectories.
This enables the agent to leverage offline data for robust initialization while
utilizing online interactions to drive efficient exploration. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach enhances exploration by
effectively combining the complementary strengths of offline and online data.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOORL learns a stable Q-function without added
complexity. Extensive experiments on 28 tasks from the D4RL and V-D4RL
benchmarks validate its effectiveness, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art offline and hybrid RL baselines. With minimal computational
overhead, MOORL achieves strong performance, underscoring its potential for
practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Result: 基础模型在分布内预测中不自信，校准误差较高；在分布偏移下校准表现更好。后处理技术在分布内有效，但在严重偏移下可能失效。

Conclusion: 基础模型的校准行为复杂，挑战了持续改进的传统观点，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty calibration is essential for safely deploying deep
neural networks in high-stakes applications. Deep neural networks are known to
exhibit systematic overconfidence, especially under distribution shifts.
Although foundation models such as ConvNeXt, EVA and BEiT have demonstrated
significant improvements in predictive performance, their calibration
properties remain underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
investigation into the calibration behavior of foundation models, revealing
insights that challenge established paradigms. Our empirical analysis shows
that these models tend to be underconfident in in-distribution predictions,
resulting in higher calibration errors, while demonstrating improved
calibration under distribution shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
foundation models are highly responsive to post-hoc calibration techniques in
the in-distribution setting, enabling practitioners to effectively mitigate
underconfidence bias. However, these methods become progressively less reliable
under severe distribution shifts and can occasionally produce counterproductive
results. Our findings highlight the complex, non-monotonic effects of
architectural and training innovations on calibration, challenging established
narratives of continuous improvement.

Abstract: Currently, existing tensor recovery methods fail to recognize the impact of
tensor scale variations on their structural characteristics. Furthermore,
existing studies face prohibitive computational costs when dealing with
large-scale high-order tensor data. To alleviate these issue, assisted by the
Krylov subspace iteration, block Lanczos bidiagonalization process, and random
projection strategies, this article first devises two fast and accurate
randomized algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) problem.
Theoretical bounds on the accuracy of the approximation error estimate are
established. Next, we develop a novel generalized nonconvex modeling framework
tailored to large-scale tensor recovery, in which a new regularization paradigm
is exploited to achieve insightful prior representation for large-scale
tensors. On the basis of the above, we further investigate new unified
nonconvex models and efficient optimization algorithms, respectively, for
several typical high-order tensor recovery tasks in unquantized and quantized
situations. To render the proposed algorithms practical and efficient for
large-scale tensor data, the proposed randomized LRTA schemes are integrated
into their central and time-intensive computations. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various large-scale tensors, whose results demonstrate
the practicability, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in
comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: SparseSSM为状态空间模型提供了高效剪枝方案，揭示了Mamba架构中的冗余分布，并支持多种稀疏性扩展。

Abstract: State-space language models such as Mamba match Transformer quality while
permitting linear complexity inference, yet still comprise billions of
parameters that hinder deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods are
tailored to attention blocks and fail to account for the time-shared and
discretized state-transition matrix at the heart of the selective state-space
module (SSM). In this paper, we introduce SparseSSM, the first training-free
pruning framework that extends the classic optimal brain surgeon (OBS)
framework to state space architectures. Our layer-wise algorithm (i) derives an
approximate second-order saliency score that aggregates Hessian-trace
information across time steps, (ii) incorporates a component sensitivity
analysis to guide feed-forward network (FFN) pruning, which also sheds light on
where redundancy resides in mamba architecture, (iii) can be easily extended to
semi-structured and structured sparsity. Empirically, we prune 50% of SSM
weights without fine-tuning and observe no zero-shot accuracy loss, achieving
the current state-of-the-art pruning algorithm for Mamba-based LLMs.

Abstract: We propose, implement, and compare with competitors a new architecture of
equivariant neural networks based on geometric (Clifford) algebras: Generalized
Lipschitz Group Equivariant Neural Networks (GLGENN). These networks are
equivariant to all pseudo-orthogonal transformations, including rotations and
reflections, of a vector space with any non-degenerate or degenerate symmetric
bilinear form. We propose a weight-sharing parametrization technique that takes
into account the fundamental structures and operations of geometric algebras.
Due to this technique, GLGENN architecture is parameter-light and has less
tendency to overfitting than baseline equivariant models. GLGENN outperforms or
matches competitors on several benchmarking equivariant tasks, including
estimation of an equivariant function and a convex hull experiment, while using
significantly fewer optimizable parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for synthetic tabular data
generation through in-context learning (ICL), offering a practical solution for
data augmentation in data scarce scenarios. While prior work has shown the
potential of LLMs to improve downstream task performance through augmenting
underrepresented groups, these benefits often assume access to a subset of
unbiased in-context examples, representative of the real dataset. In real-world
settings, however, data is frequently noisy and demographically skewed. In this
paper, we systematically study how statistical biases within in-context
examples propagate to the distribution of synthetic tabular data, showing that
even mild in-context biases lead to global statistical distortions. We further
introduce an adversarial scenario where a malicious contributor can inject bias
into the synthetic dataset via a subset of in-context examples, ultimately
compromising the fairness of downstream classifiers for a targeted and
protected subgroup. Our findings demonstrate a new vulnerability associated
with LLM-based data generation pipelines that rely on in-context prompts with
in sensitive domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FedVLMBench，首个系统化的联邦学习VLM微调基准，涵盖多种架构、策略和任务，揭示了数据异质性对任务的影响，并提供了优化配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM微调方法依赖集中训练，难以满足隐私敏感领域需求，且缺乏联邦学习下的全面评估基准。

Method: 整合两种主流VLM架构、四种微调策略、五种FL算法、六个多模态数据集，覆盖单任务和多任务场景。

Conclusion: FedVLMBench为隐私保护的多模态模型联邦训练提供了标准化平台和实用指导。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cross-modal understanding and generation by integrating visual and textual
information. While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing
approaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in
domains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have
introduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these
privacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated
fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain
lacking. In this work, we present \textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic
benchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two
mainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning
strategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four
cross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,
covering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive
experiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task
federated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron
(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal
configuration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods
exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in
vision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and
encoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools,
datasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a
standardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of
multimodal foundation models.

TL;DR: SyncFed是一个时间感知的联邦学习框架，通过显式同步和时间戳量化延迟，提升模型准确性和信息新鲜度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在大规模分布式环境中面临网络延迟、时钟不同步和客户端更新不一致等问题，影响模型可靠性和收敛性。

Method: SyncFed采用显式同步和时间戳（基于NTP协议）量化延迟，服务器根据时间戳加权聚合客户端更新。

Result: 实验表明，SyncFed在分布式测试环境中显著提升模型准确性和信息新鲜度。

Conclusion: SyncFed通过时间感知机制解决了联邦学习中的延迟问题，优于传统轮次基线方法。

Abstract: As Federated Learning (FL) expands to larger and more distributed
environments, consistency in training is challenged by network-induced delays,
clock unsynchronicity, and variability in client updates. This combination of
factors may contribute to misaligned contributions that undermine model
reliability and convergence. Existing methods like staleness-aware aggregation
and model versioning address lagging updates heuristically, yet lack mechanisms
to quantify staleness, especially in latency-sensitive and cross-regional
deployments. In light of these considerations, we introduce \emph{SyncFed}, a
time-aware FL framework that employs explicit synchronization and timestamping
to establish a common temporal reference across the system. Staleness is
quantified numerically based on exchanged timestamps under the Network Time
Protocol (NTP), enabling the server to reason about the relative freshness of
client updates and apply temporally informed weighting during aggregation. Our
empirical evaluation on a geographically distributed testbed shows that, under
\emph{SyncFed}, the global model evolves within a stable temporal context,
resulting in improved accuracy and information freshness compared to
round-based baselines devoid of temporal semantics.

TL;DR: WAFFLE算法通过小波散射变换或傅里叶变换的压缩表示，在联邦学习训练前检测异常客户端，提升模型性能和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中异常客户端（如数据分布不具代表性或传感器故障）会显著降低模型性能，且在不访问原始数据的情况下检测这些客户端是一大挑战。

Method: 提出WAFFLE算法，利用小波散射变换或傅里叶变换生成低维任务无关嵌入，通过轻量级检测器在公共数据集上训练并标记异常客户端。

Result: 实验表明，WAFFLE在检测准确性和下游分类性能上优于现有联邦学习异常检测算法。

Conclusion: WAFFLE作为预训练替代方案，有效解决了联邦学习中的异常客户端检测问题，尤其小波散射变换因其理论优势更适用于联邦场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models
across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, the
presence of anomalous or corrupted clients - such as those with faulty sensors
or non representative data distributions - can significantly degrade model
performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key
challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated
Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before
training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from
either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both
approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for
unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a
distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication
and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection,
WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to
local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated
scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves
detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to
existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a
pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.

Motivation: 传统超图神经网络采用两阶段框架，信息聚合方式简单，仅能捕获一阶统计信息，无法保留分布的几何特性。

Method: 提出Wasserstein超图神经网络，将节点和超边邻域视为分布，使用Sliced Wasserstein Pooling进行信息聚合。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个真实数据集上显著提升了节点分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: Wasserstein聚合方法能够保留分布的形状和扩散特性，优于传统聚合方式。

Abstract: The ability to model relational information using machine learning has driven
advancements across various domains, from medicine to social science. While
graph representation learning has become mainstream over the past decade,
representing higher-order relationships through hypergraphs is rapidly gaining
momentum. In the last few years, numerous hypergraph neural networks have
emerged, most of them falling under a two-stage, set-based framework. The
messages are sent from nodes to edges and then from edges to nodes. However,
most of the advancement still takes inspiration from the graph counterpart,
often simplifying the aggregations to basic pooling operations. In this paper
we are introducing Wasserstein Hypergraph Neural Network, a model that treats
the nodes and hyperedge neighbourhood as distributions and aggregate the
information using Sliced Wasserstein Pooling. Unlike conventional aggregators
such as mean or sum, which only capture first-order statistics, our approach
has the ability to preserve geometric properties like the shape and spread of
distributions. This enables the learned embeddings to reflect how easily one
hyperedge distribution can be transformed into another, following principles of
optimal transport. Experimental results demonstrate that applying Wasserstein
pooling in a hypergraph setting significantly benefits node classification
tasks, achieving top performance on several real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM等模型在生成任务中表现优异，但无法保证输出满足时序约束。

Result: 实验证明TRIDENT完美满足约束，同时提升输出质量和效率。

Conclusion: TRIDENT是一种高效、通用的方法，适用于多种任务，确保约束满足且提升性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved
impressive results across a variety of generative and classification tasks.
However, they remain fundamentally ill-equipped to ensure that their outputs
satisfy temporal constraints, such as those expressible in Linear Temporal
Logic over finite traces (LTLf). In this paper, we introduce TRIDENT: a general
and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with
such constraints without requiring any retraining. TRIDENT compiles LTLf
formulas into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which is used to guide a
constrained variant of beam search. At each decoding step, transitions that
would lead to constraint violations are masked, while remaining paths are
dynamically re-ranked based on both the model's probabilities and the DFA's
acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are
guaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically
demonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach
on two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and
controlled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect
constraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows
improved efficiency and high standard quality metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络增加深度时可能引入计算冗余，而表示质量未显著提升，因此需要一种能自动压缩信息并提升效率的架构。

Method: 提出 ACNs，用长前馈连接替代短残差连接，通过梯度下降动态压缩信息，优化层间训练模式。

Result: ACNs 在减少灾难性遗忘、压缩架构、噪声鲁棒性和低数据性能方面表现优异，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: ACNs 是一种高效且自动适应任务复杂度的神经网络架构，能学习鲁棒表示并减少冗余。

Abstract: Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated
remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces
computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation
quality. In this work, we introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an
architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each
layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. ACNs
showcase a unique property we coin as "auto-compression", the ability of a
network to organically compress information during training with gradient
descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression,
information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training,
enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in
deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise
training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during
training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced
noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in
low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that
generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to
18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression
while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT
architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling ACNs with traditional
pruning techniques, enables significantly better sparsity-performance
trade-offs compared to conventional architectures. These findings establish
ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that
automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while
learning robust representations.

Result: AtmosMJ在500天内保持稳定，10天预测精度与先进模型相当，训练成本仅5.7天。

Conclusion: 高效架构设计比非标准数据表示更能实现稳定且计算高效的长期天气预测。

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in
data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional
numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range
autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.
Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as
SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard
spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the
prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce
physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that
assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be
achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep
convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical
remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion
(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error
accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that
AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.
In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy
against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a
remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest
that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data
representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally
efficient long-range weather prediction.

Abstract: Multi-modal graphs, which integrate diverse multi-modal features and
relations, are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However, existing
multi-modal graph learning methods are typically trained from scratch for
specific graph data and tasks, failing to generalize across various multi-modal
graph data and tasks. To bridge this gap, we explore the potential of
Multi-modal Graph Large Language Models (MG-LLM) to unify and generalize across
diverse multi-modal graph data and tasks. We propose a unified framework of
multi-modal graph data, task, and model, discovering the inherent
multi-granularity and multi-scale characteristics in multi-modal graphs.
Specifically, we present five key desired characteristics for MG-LLM: 1)
unified space for multi-modal structures and attributes, 2) capability of
handling diverse multi-modal graph tasks, 3) multi-modal graph in-context
learning, 4) multi-modal graph interaction with natural language, and 5)
multi-modal graph reasoning. We then elaborate on the key challenges, review
related works, and highlight promising future research directions towards
realizing these ambitious characteristics. Finally, we summarize existing
multi-modal graph datasets pertinent for model training. We believe this paper
can contribute to the ongoing advancement of the research towards MG-LLM for
generalization across multi-modal graph data and tasks.

Abstract: Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is
crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability
outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive
architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to
agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the
interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision
Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps:
Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data
representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus
on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant
information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis,
and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This
process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on
LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general.
The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM
utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing
highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher
accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.

Abstract: This paper proposes Load-aware Tram-FL, an extension of Tram-FL that
introduces a training scheduling mechanism to minimize total training time in
decentralized federated learning by accounting for both computational and
communication loads. The scheduling problem is formulated as a global
optimization task, which-though intractable in its original form-is made
solvable by decomposing it into node-wise subproblems. To promote balanced data
utilization under non-IID distributions, a variance constraint is introduced,
while the overall training latency, including both computation and
communication costs, is minimized through the objective function. Simulation
results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that Load-aware Tram-FL significantly
reduces training time and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) operates on a simple yet effective principle:
embeddings of positive pairs are pulled together, while those of negative pairs
are pushed apart. Although various forms of contrastive loss have been proposed
and analyzed from different perspectives, prior works lack a comprehensive
framework that systematically explains a broad class of these objectives. In
this paper, we present a unified framework for understanding CL, which is based
on analyzing the cosine similarity between embeddings of positive and negative
pairs. In full-batch settings, we show that perfect alignment of positive pairs
is unattainable when similarities of negative pairs fall below a certain
threshold, and that this misalignment can be alleviated by incorporating
within-view negative pairs. In mini-batch settings, we demonstrate that smaller
batch sizes incur stronger separation among negative pairs within batches,
which leads to higher variance in similarities of negative pairs. To address
this limitation of mini-batch CL, we introduce an auxiliary loss term that
reduces the variance of similarities of negative pairs in CL. Empirical results
demonstrate that incorporating the proposed loss consistently improves the
performance of CL methods in small-batch training.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning
representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its
application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains,
remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often
assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for
dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical
framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data},
which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In
particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures}
between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive
an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that
accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing
dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent
TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the
dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones
for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically
grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies.
Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with
accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on
the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal
patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in graph
representation learning and have been applied to various domains. However, many
real-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles
in social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is
performed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning
protocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the
privacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of
GNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy
guarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node
classification accuracy) for graph learning. Despite these advantages, such
protocols may be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, a threat that has not
been considered in previous research. Identifying and addressing these threats
is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph
learning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack
targeting locally private graph learning protocols. The attacker injects fake
users into the protocol, manipulates these fake users to establish links with
genuine users, and sends carefully crafted data to the server, ultimately
compromising the utility of private graph learning. The effectiveness of the
attack is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. In addition, several
defense strategies have also been explored, but their limited effectiveness
highlights the need for more robust defenses.

Result: ProjNCE在多个数据集和设置中表现优于SupCon和标准交叉熵训练。

Conclusion: ProjNCE从互信息解释和投影设计两方面改进了SupCon，为对比学习提供了更灵活和高效的方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for representation learning and has been studied from multiple
perspectives, including mutual information and geometric viewpoints. However,
supervised contrastive (SupCon) approaches have received comparatively little
attention in this context: for instance, while InfoNCE used in SSCL is known to
form a lower bound on mutual information (MI), the relationship between SupCon
and MI remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a
generalization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised
contrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment
term for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and
affords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class
embeddings. Building on this flexibility, we further explore the centroid-based
class embeddings in SupCon by exploring a variety of projection methods.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings demonstrate that
ProjNCE consistently outperforms both SupCon and standard cross-entropy
training. Our work thus refines SupCon along two complementary
perspective--mutual information interpretation and projection design--and
offers broadly applicable improvements whenever SupCon serves as the
foundational contrastive objective.

Conclusion: 研究呼吁重新审视数据驱动动态系统建模的期望，并为评估学习线性ODE的可信度提供量化依据。

Abstract: Dynamical systems modeling is a core pillar of scientific inquiry across
natural and life sciences. Increasingly, dynamical system models are learned
from data, rendering identifiability a paramount concept. For systems that are
not identifiable from data, no guarantees can be given about their behavior
under new conditions and inputs, or about possible control mechanisms to steer
the system. It is known in the community that "linear ordinary differential
equations (ODE) are almost surely identifiable from a single trajectory."
However, this only holds for dense matrices. The sparse regime remains
underexplored, despite its practical relevance with sparsity arising naturally
in many biological, social, and physical systems. In this work, we address this
gap by characterizing the identifiability of sparse linear ODEs. Contrary to
the dense case, we show that sparse systems are unidentifiable with a positive
probability in practically relevant sparsity regimes and provide lower bounds
for this probability. We further study empirically how this theoretical
unidentifiability manifests in state-of-the-art methods to estimate linear ODEs
from data. Our results corroborate that sparse systems are also practically
unidentifiable. Theoretical limitations are not resolved through inductive
biases or optimization dynamics. Our findings call for rethinking what can be
expected from data-driven dynamical system modeling and allows for quantitative

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在隐私保护方面具有优势，但存在拜占庭参与者提交有害梯度的安全威胁。现有方法在异构数据环境下难以区分诚实与拜占庭梯度。

Result: WoLA在异构数据环境下显著优于现有方法，并通过理论和实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: WoLA为解决联邦学习中的拜占庭攻击问题提供了有效解决方案，尤其在数据异构性强的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple
data holders to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing
their training data with external parties. In this paradigm, workers locally
update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or
model parameters). While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it
opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine)
participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming
model convergence. Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that
the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent. Towards this
purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation,
assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than
honest gradients do from each other. However, in heterogeneous settings, honest
gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest
outliers from Byzantine ones. In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label
Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients
despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines'
gradients. This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and
empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GGC的框架，通过图自动编码器压缩图数据，以提升量子或经典分类器的性能，并在高能物理的喷注标记任务中验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络（GNNs）在大规模图数据上的内存和计算效率问题，同时探索量子计算（QC）在图数据上的潜力。

Method: 提出Guided Graph Compression（GGC）框架，利用图自动编码器压缩节点数量和特征维度，并优化下游分类任务性能。

Result: GGC在喷注标记任务中表现优于单独使用自动编码器或经典GNN分类器，同时支持在真实数据集上测试量子图神经网络（QGNNs）。

Conclusion: GGC为大规模图数据处理和量子算法测试提供了有效解决方案，展示了量子计算在图数据上的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured
data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and
inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a
promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic
approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been
explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the
dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches
either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work
introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph
autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node
features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream
classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical
classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a
classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that
involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons.
The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing
step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results
demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the
testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法高效、紧凑，适用于工业环境中的快速可靠油样分类。

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based methodology for the
classification of various oil samples based on their dielectric properties,
utilizing a microwave resonant sensor. The dielectric behaviour of oils,
governed by their molecular composition, induces distinct shifts in the
sensor's resonant frequency and amplitude response. These variations are
systematically captured and processed to extract salient features, which serve
as inputs for multiple machine learning classifiers. The microwave resonant
sensor operates in a non-destructive, low-power manner, making it particularly
well-suited for real-time industrial applications. A comprehensive dataset is
developed by varying the permittivity of oil samples and acquiring the
corresponding sensor responses. Several classifiers are trained and evaluated
using the extracted resonant features to assess their capability in
distinguishing between oil types. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves a high classification accuracy of 99.41% with the
random forest classifier, highlighting its strong potential for automated oil
identification. The system's compact form factor, efficiency, and high
performance underscore its viability for fast and reliable oil characterization
in industrial environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据异构性下实现了隐私保护和拜占庭弹性，同时通过通信优化使其具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Ensuring resilience to Byzantine clients while maintaining the privacy of the
clients' data is a fundamental challenge in federated learning (FL). When the
clients' data is homogeneous, suitable countermeasures were studied from an
information-theoretic perspective utilizing secure aggregation techniques while
ensuring robust aggregation of the clients' gradients. However, the
countermeasures used fail when the clients' data is heterogeneous. Suitable
pre-processing techniques, such as nearest neighbor mixing, were recently shown
to enhance the performance of those countermeasures in the heterogeneous
setting. Nevertheless, those pre-processing techniques cannot be applied with
the introduced privacy-preserving mechanisms.
  We propose a multi-stage method encompassing a careful co-design of
verifiable secret sharing, secure aggregation, and a tailored symmetric private
information retrieval scheme to achieve information-theoretic privacy
guarantees and Byzantine resilience under data heterogeneity. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our scheme on a variety of attacks and show how it outperforms
the previously known techniques. Since the communication overhead of secure
aggregation is non-negligible, we investigate the interplay with zero-order
estimation methods that reduce the communication cost in state-of-the-art FL
tasks and thereby make private aggregation scalable.

Method: 提出基于球谐函数的新视角，设计两种估计器：张量展开和在线SGD。

Result: 在任意球对称输入分布下，两种估计器分别实现了最优样本复杂度和最优运行时间。

Conclusion: 球谐函数视角不仅统一了现有结果，还揭示了新现象，表明同时实现样本和计算最优的估计器可能不存在。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning single-index models, where the label $y \in
\mathbb{R}$ depends on the input $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ only through
an unknown one-dimensional projection $\langle
\boldsymbol{w}_*,\boldsymbol{x}\rangle$. Prior work has shown that under
Gaussian inputs, the statistical and computational complexity of recovering
$\boldsymbol{w}_*$ is governed by the Hermite expansion of the link function.
In this paper, we propose a new perspective: we argue that "spherical
harmonics" -- rather than "Hermite polynomials" -- provide the natural basis
for this problem, as they capture its intrinsic "rotational symmetry". Building
on this insight, we characterize the complexity of learning single-index models
under arbitrary spherically symmetric input distributions. We introduce two
families of estimators -- based on tensor unfolding and online SGD -- that
respectively achieve either optimal sample complexity or optimal runtime, and
argue that estimators achieving both may not exist in general. When specialized
to Gaussian inputs, our theory not only recovers and clarifies existing results
but also reveals new phenomena that had previously been overlooked.

Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations
to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are
highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change
and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to
quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able
to incorporate physics-informed causal relationships. Here, we develop an
interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning.
We derive a physics-informed approach including a Bayesian filter for stable
long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns
accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its
components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed
climate models.

Result: VQVAE显著降低了攻击的有效性，并揭示了离散潜在空间的特性。

Conclusion: VQVAE在对抗攻击下表现出良好的防御能力，其潜在空间特性可能有助于攻击检测。

Abstract: Having designed a VQVAE that maps digital radio waveforms into discrete
latent space, and yields a perfectly classifiable reconstruction of the
original data, we here analyze the attack suppressing properties of VQVAE when
an adversarial attack is performed on high-SNR radio-frequency (RF)
data-points. To target amplitude modulations from a subset of digitally
modulated waveform classes, we first create adversarial attacks that preserve
the phase between the in-phase and quadrature component whose values are
adversarially changed. We compare them with adversarial attacks of the same
intensity where phase is not preserved. We test the classification accuracy of
such adversarial examples on a classifier trained to deliver 100% accuracy on
the original data. To assess the ability of VQVAE to suppress the strength of
the attack, we evaluate the classifier accuracy on the reconstructions by VQVAE
of the adversarial datapoints and show that VQVAE substantially decreases the
effectiveness of the attack. We also compare the I/Q plane diagram of the
attacked data, their reconstructions and the original data. Finally, using
multiple methods and metrics, we compare the probability distribution of the
VQVAE latent space with and without attack. Varying the attack strength, we
observe interesting properties of the discrete space, which may help detect the
attacks.

Conclusion: DNA方法不仅提升了可解释性，还为强化学习的探索和规划提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we provide an extended discussion of a new approach to
explainable Reinforcement Learning called Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives
(DNA), first proposed at L4DC 2025. DNA seeks a set of reasonable "options" for
trajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively
diverse trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these
distinct policies are used to "explain" an agent's options in terms of
available trajectory shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular,
DNA applies to value function-based policies on Markov decision processes where
agents are limited to continuous trajectories. Here, we describe DNA, which
uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems to solve for
distinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality. We show that it
successfully returns qualitatively different policies that constitute
meaningfully different "options" in simulation, including a brief comparison to
related approaches in the stochastic optimization field of Quality Diversity.
Beyond the explanatory motivation, this work opens new possibilities for
exploration and adaptive planning in RL.

Motivation: 现有针对MU的隐私推断攻击依赖较弱的威胁模型（需访问原始模型和遗忘模型），限制了实际应用。本文旨在设计一种更严格的威胁模型下的高效攻击方法。

Method: 提出A Posteriori Label-Only Membership Inference Attack（Apollo），仅利用遗忘模型的标签输出推断样本是否被遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，Apollo在仅需较少模型访问权限的情况下，仍能高精度推断遗忘样本的成员状态。

Conclusion: Apollo攻击方法在严格威胁模型下高效，揭示了MU场景中潜在的隐私风险。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to update Machine Learning (ML) models following
requests to remove training samples and their influences on a trained model
efficiently without retraining the original ML model from scratch. While MU
itself has been employed to provide privacy protection and regulatory
compliance, it can also increase the attack surface of the model. Existing
privacy inference attacks towards MU that aim to infer properties of the
unlearned set rely on the weaker threat model that assumes the attacker has
access to both the unlearned model and the original model, limiting their
feasibility toward real-life scenarios. We propose a novel privacy attack, A
Posteriori Label-Only Membership Inference Attack towards MU, Apollo, that
infers whether a data sample has been unlearned, following a strict threat
model where an adversary has access to the label-output of the unlearned model
only. We demonstrate that our proposed attack, while requiring less access to
the target model compared to previous attacks, can achieve relatively high
precision on the membership status of the unlearned samples.

Result: 在MovieLens数据集上，VI收敛速度更快，而MCMC的后验估计更准确。

Conclusion: VI适合需要快速收敛的场景，而MCMC适合需要高精度后验估计的场景。

Abstract: Matrix factorization is a widely used technique in recommendation systems.
Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [1] extends traditional matrix
factorization by incorporating probability distributions over latent factors,
allowing for uncertainty quantification. However, computing the posterior
distribution is intractable due to the high-dimensional integral. To address
this, we employ two Bayesian inference methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
[2] and Variational Inference (VI) [3] to approximate the posterior. We
evaluate their performance on MovieLens dataset and compare their convergence
speed, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency. Experimental results
demonstrate that VI offers faster convergence, while MCMC provides more
accurate posterior estimates.

Result: 算法在样本复杂度为O(1/ε²)的情况下，可证明地学习到ε最优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了信息不对称和知识迁移问题，为强化学习中的策略优化提供了理论保障。

Abstract: Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems,
especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents
tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards.
These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding
variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant
challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target
environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where
empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper
explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d.
actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We
present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system
dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of
knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an
online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件扩散模型（CDMs）在生成任务中表现出色，但其建模能力导致类别特征与无关上下文纠缠，难以提取鲁棒且可解释的表示。

Method: 通过识别CLAReps（保留类别信息、丢弃无关信号的潜在代码），并开发CaDistill范式，利用CDM作为教师模型，仅通过CLAReps传递核心类别知识。

Result: 实验表明，学生模型仅使用10%的训练数据（CLAReps）即可实现强对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力，更专注于类别信号而非虚假背景线索。

Conclusion: CDMs不仅可以作为图像生成器，还能作为紧凑、可解释的教师模型，推动鲁棒表示学习。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across
a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution
has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative
learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the
class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to
extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify
Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM
features preserve essential categorical information while discarding
non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative
samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the
core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we
develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While
the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers
core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the
training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial
robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals
instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve
not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that
can drive robust representation learning.

Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型（AR-LLMs）中隐含并行性的启发，开发一种能够原生并行生成的模型，以提高效率和性能。

Method: Multiverse采用MapReduce范式，分为Map（任务分解）、Process（并行执行子任务）和Reduce（结果合成）三个阶段。通过数据、算法和系统的协同设计，实现快速迁移和高效训练。

Result: Multiverse-32B在3小时微调后，性能与同规模领先AR-LLMs相当（AIME24 & 25得分54%和46%），且在相同上下文长度下平均表现优于AR-LLMs 1.87%，速度提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: Multiverse展示了原生并行生成模型的潜力，为高效、高性能的生成任务提供了新方向，并开源了整个生态系统以促进研究。

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (AR-LLMs) frequently exhibit implicit
parallelism in sequential generation. Inspired by this, we introduce
Multiverse, a new generative model that enables natively parallel generation.
Multiverse internalizes a MapReduce paradigm, generating automatically through
three stages: (i) a Map stage for adaptive task decomposition, (ii) a Process
stage for parallel subtask execution, and (iii) a Reduce stage for lossless
result synthesis. Next, we build a real-world Multiverse reasoning model with
co-design of data, algorithm, and system, enabling rapid and seamless transfer
from frontier AR-LLMs. Starting from sequential reasoning chains, we create
Multiverse 1K by converting them into structured training data using an
automated LLM-assisted pipeline, avoiding costly human annotations.
Algorithmically, we design Multiverse Attention to separate parallel reasoning
steps while keeping compatibility with causal attention for efficient training.
Systematically, we implement Multiverse Engine to enable parallel inference. It
features a dedicated scheduler that dynamically switches between sequential and
parallel generation, triggered directly by the model. After a 3-hour
fine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only
open-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of
the same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively.
Moreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits
superior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same
context length. Such scaling further leads to practical efficiency gain,
achieving up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes. We have open-sourced the
entire Multiverse ecosystem, including data, model weights, engine, supporting
tools, as well as complete data curation prompts and detailed training and
evaluation recipes.

Motivation: LLMs能准确描述概率分布但生成样本时存在偏差，限制了其在需要可靠随机性的任务中的应用。

Method: 提出Verbalized Rejection Sampling (VRS)，一种基于自然语言的拒绝采样方法，通过提示LLM接受或拒绝样本。

Result: VRS显著减少了采样偏差，理论分析表明其在直接采样基础上有所改进。

Conclusion: VRS展示了如何将经典概率工具嵌入LLM工作流以提高可靠性，无需访问模型内部或复杂提示设计。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability
distributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate
faithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring
reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,
and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and
sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized
Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection
sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed
samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS
substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical
analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct
sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More
broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized
and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring
access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.

Conclusion: ISEK代表了从集中式平台向去中心化认知系统的范式转变。

Abstract: The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a
decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents
collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on
Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a
decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic
AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient
self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.
  The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a
six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for
dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a
multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the
native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and
reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based
identity management.
  This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and
incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates
emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional
platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized
cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond
centralized constraints.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了行为多样性何时能带来显著优势，为多智能体系统的奖励设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the
division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation
for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing
on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question
from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited
for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial
setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation
operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on
individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$
task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these
operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for
broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask
what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents
must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such
settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational
paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a
gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified
MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.
Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show
that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes
predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both
validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in
MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity
delivers a measurable benefit.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对任务导向LLM代理的威胁模型和评估方法，通过多代理红队系统CRAFT测试代理的稳健性，并提出了防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在严格政策领域（如退款或取消规则）中，确保LLM代理始终遵守规则并拒绝违规请求，同时保持自然交互，是一个挑战。

Method: 提出CRAFT多代理红队系统，利用策略感知的劝说策略测试代理的稳健性，并引入tau-break基准评估代理对抗操纵行为的能力。

Result: CRAFT在客户服务场景中优于传统越狱方法，但现有防御策略仍不足以完全保护代理。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究更强健的防护措施，以保护策略遵守型代理免受对抗攻击。

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict
policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies
in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies,
appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still
maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development
of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience
against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses
on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal
benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system
that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a
policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming
conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and
coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce
tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's
robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several
straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide
some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger,
research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial
attacks

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DNN模型复杂度增加，降低计算成本和内存开销的需求日益迫切，稀疏性成为一种重要方法。

Method: 采用稀疏进化训练（SET）和基于基序的优化方法对稀疏多层感知机进行结构优化。

Result: 潜在效率提升超过40%，性能下降低于4%。

Conclusion: 结构优化可以显著提升稀疏进化训练的性能，同时保持准确性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proven to be exceptionally effective
and have been applied across diverse domains within deep learning. However, as
DNN models increase in complexity, the demand for reduced computational costs
and memory overheads has become increasingly urgent. Sparsity has emerged as a
leading approach in this area. The robustness of sparse Multi-layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) for supervised feature selection, along with the application of Sparse
Evolutionary Training (SET), illustrates the feasibility of reducing
computational costs without compromising accuracy. Moreover, it is believed
that the SET algorithm can still be improved through a structural optimization
method called motif-based optimization, with potential efficiency gains
exceeding 40% and a performance decline of under 4%. This research investigates
whether the structural optimization of Sparse Evolutionary Training applied to
Multi-layer Perceptrons (SET-MLP) can enhance performance and to what extent
this improvement can be achieved.

Motivation: SNN和神经形态计算在边缘和植入设备中具有高能效潜力，但缺乏标准化和可操作的能源评估指标。

Method: 对SNN文献中的能源效率指标进行初步探索性研究，基于四个关键属性（可访问性、保真度、可操作性和趋势分析）分类13种常用指标。

Result: 发现现有指标虽能比较架构，但缺乏对开发者的实际指导；指出可访问性与高保真度指标之间的差距，以及可操作性指标的不足。

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向，包括提升指标的可访问性与保真度、开发可操作指标、趋势分析指标等，为SNN能源评估提供更实用的工具。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and neuromorphic computing present a promising
alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by significantly
improving energy efficiency, particularly in edge and implantable devices.
However, assessing the energy performance of SNN models remains a challenge due
to the lack of standardized and actionable metrics and the difficulty of
measuring energy consumption in experimental neuromorphic hardware. In this
paper, we conduct a preliminary exploratory study of energy efficiency metrics
proposed in the SNN benchmarking literature. We classify 13 commonly used
metrics based on four key properties: Accessibility, Fidelity, Actionability,
and Trend-Based analysis. Our findings indicate that while many existing
metrics provide useful comparisons between architectures, they often lack
practical insights for SNN developers. Notably, we identify a gap between
accessible and high-fidelity metrics, limiting early-stage energy assessment.
Additionally, we emphasize the lack of metrics that provide practitioners with
actionable insights, making it difficult to guide energy-efficient SNN
development. To address these challenges, we outline research directions for
bridging accessibility and fidelity and finding new Actionable metrics for
implantable neuromorphic devices, introducing more Trend-Based metrics, metrics
that reflect changes in power requirements, battery-aware metrics, and
improving energy-performance tradeoff assessments. The results from this paper
pave the way for future research on enhancing energy metrics and their
Actionability for SNNs.

Conclusion: FrFT为作曲家和声音设计师提供了一种突破听觉创意边界的变革性工具。

Abstract: This paper explores the innovative application of the Fractional Fourier
Transform (FrFT) in sound synthesis, highlighting its potential to redefine
time-frequency analysis in audio processing. As an extension of the classical
Fourier Transform, the FrFT introduces fractional order parameters, enabling a
continuous interpolation between time and frequency domains and unlocking
unprecedented flexibility in signal manipulation. Crucially, the FrFT also
opens the possibility of directly synthesizing sounds in the alpha-domain,
providing a unique framework for creating timbral and dynamic characteristics
unattainable through conventional methods. This work delves into the
mathematical principles of the FrFT, its historical evolution, and its
capabilities for synthesizing complex audio textures. Through experimental
analyses, we showcase novel sound design techniques, such as alpha-synthesis
and alpha-filtering, which leverage the FrFT's time-frequency rotation
properties to produce innovative sonic results. The findings affirm the FrFT's
value as a transformative tool for composers, sound designers, and researchers
seeking to push the boundaries of auditory creativity.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合上下文偏置（CB）方法与预训练语音基础模型（OWSM v3.1）的方法，以提升对罕见和未见单词的识别能力，同时保持预训练模型的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音基础模型（SFMs）在识别罕见和未见单词时表现不佳，而现有的上下文偏置方法因缺乏预训练知识而性能较低。

Method: 将现有的CB方法与OWSM v3.1结合，冻结预训练参数，利用SFMs的知识实现有效的CB。

Result: 在LibriSpeech 100测试集上，B-WER提升了11.6点，整体WER提升0.9点，实时因子降低7.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持SFMs优势的同时，显著提升了罕见单词的识别性能。

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs), such as Open Whisper-Style Speech Models
(OWSM), are trained on massive datasets to achieve accurate automatic speech
recognition. However, even SFMs struggle to accurately recognize rare and
unseen words. While contextual biasing (CB) is a promising approach to improve
recognition of such words, most CB methods are trained from scratch, resulting
in lower performance than SFMs due to the lack of pre-trained knowledge. This
paper integrates an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its
pre-trained parameters. By leveraging the knowledge embedded in SFMs, the
proposed method enables effective CB while preserving the advantages of SFMs,
even with a small dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method
improves the biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points, resulting in a 0.9
point improvement in the overall WER while reducing the real-time factor by
7.5% compared to the non-biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech 100 test-clean
set.

Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of
BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and
long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture,
BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional
ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition
(AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better
model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the
Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally
proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity
detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this
combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio.
We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD
+ MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM,
PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a
comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and
implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are

Result: 方法显著提升了语音质量和清晰度，在多语言和视觉线索受损场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 研究表明，引入语言约束是一种有效的AV-TSE性能提升策略，且无需额外推理成本。

Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on
target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know
that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to
support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of
pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models
(PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose
incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE
model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra
computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently
improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our
method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show
robust performance gains.

Conclusion: UmbraTTS为复杂环境中的语音合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have enabled highly natural speech
synthesis, yet integrating speech with complex background environments remains
challenging. We introduce UmbraTTS, a flow-matching based TTS model that
jointly generates both speech and environmental audio, conditioned on text and
acoustic context. Our model allows fine-grained control over background volume
and produces diverse, coherent, and context-aware audio scenes. A key challenge
is the lack of data with speech and background audio aligned in natural
context. To overcome the lack of paired training data, we propose a
self-supervised framework that extracts speech, background audio, and
transcripts from unannotated recordings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
UmbraTTS significantly outperformed existing baselines, producing natural,
high-quality, environmentally aware audios.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能显著降低计算负担，同时保持任务卸载的高效性。

Abstract: Under a dramatic increase in mobile data traffic, a promising solution for
edge computing systems to maintain their local service is the task migration
that may be implemented by means of Autonomous mobile agents (AMA). In
designing an optimal scheme for task offloading to AMA, we define a system cost
as a minimization objective function that comprises two parts. First, an
offloading cost which can be interpreted as the cost of using computational
resources from the AMA. Second, a penalty cost due to potential task
expiration. To minimize the expected (timeaverage) cost over a given time
horizon, we formulate a Dynamic programming (DP). However, the DP Equation
suffers from the well-known curse of dimensionality, which makes computations
intractable, especially for infinite system state space. To reduce the
computational burden, we identify three important properties of the optimal
policy and show that it suffices to evaluate the DP Equation on a finite subset
of the state space only. We then prove that the optimal task offloading
decision at a state can be inferred from that at its adjacent states, further
reducing the computational load. We present simulations to verify the
theoretical results and to provide insights into the considered system.

Abstract: This article addresses the output regulation problem for a class of nonlinear
systems using a data-driven approach. An output feedback controller is proposed
that integrates a traditional control component with a data-driven learning
algorithm based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression to learn the nonlinear
internal model. Specifically, a data-driven technique is employed to directly
approximate the unknown internal model steady-state map from observed
input-output data online. Our method does not rely on model-based observers
utilized in previous studies, making it robust and suitable for systems with
modelling errors and model uncertainties. Finally, we demonstrate through
numerical examples and detailed stability analysis that, under suitable
conditions, the closed-loop system remains bounded and converges to a compact
set, with the size of this set decreasing as the accuracy of the data-driven
model improves over time.

Abstract: Matrix computations have become increasingly significant in many data-driven
applications. However, Moores law for digital computers has been gradually
approaching its limit in recent years. Moreover, digital computers encounter
substantial complexity when performing matrix computations and need a long time
to finish the computations, and existing analog matrix computation schemes
require a large chip area and power consumption. This paper proposes a linear
algebra system of equations based on integrators, which features low power
consumption, compact area, and fast computation time. Due to the simple
structure of the ring oscillator, the ring oscillator-based integrator exhibits

Abstract: Infrastructure and processes for handling of liquid hydrogen (LH2) is needed
to enable large-scale decarbonization of aviation with hydrogen aircraft. At
large airports, pipeline and hydrant systems will be important for a mature
hydrogen-powered air travel market. As the vaporization of LH2 is a challenge
in fuel handling, the pipeline infrastructure must be designed and operated
such that the fuel is subcooled. Through modelling and simulation of aircraft
tanks refuelling by a pipeline infrastructure concept, it is found that
continuous recycling of LH2 within the system is needed to maintain subcooling,
and the pump operation is important for preventing flashing. With the proposed
concept, some hydrogen vapor is formed in the aircraft tank, but the vapor can
be utilised by hydrogen-powered ground support equipment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication is
transforming Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), with 6G networks
expected to provide ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-capacity connectivity
for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as key enablers in optimizing V2X
communication by enhancing network management, predictive analytics, security,
and cooperative driving due to their outstanding performance across various
domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. This survey
comprehensively reviews recent advances in AI and ML models applied to 6G-V2X
communication. It focuses on state-of-the-art techniques, including Deep
Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Generative Learning (GL), and
Federated Learning (FL), with particular emphasis on developments from the past
two years. Notably, AI, especially GL, has shown remarkable progress and
emerging potential in enhancing the performance, adaptability, and intelligence
of 6G-V2X systems. Despite these advances, a systematic summary of recent
research efforts in this area remains lacking, which this survey aims to
address. We analyze their roles in 6G-V2X applications, such as intelligent
resource allocation, beamforming, intelligent traffic management, and security
management. Furthermore, we explore the technical challenges, including
computational complexity, data privacy, and real-time decision-making
constraints, while identifying future research directions for AI-driven 6G-V2X
development. This study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers,
engineers, and policymakers working towards realizing intelligent, AI-powered
V2X ecosystems in 6G communication.

Abstract: Soft robots manufactured with flexible materials can be highly compliant and
adaptive to their surroundings, which facilitates their application in areas
such as dexterous manipulation and environmental exploration. This paper aims
at investigating the tracking control problem for soft robots under uncertainty
such as unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. First, we establish a
novel switching function and design the compensated tracking error dynamics by
virtue of the command filter. Then, based on the backstepping methodology, the
virtual controllers and the adaptive logic estimating the supremum of
uncertainty impacts are developed for synthesizing an event-triggered control
strategy. In addition, the uniformed finite-time stability certification is
derived for different scenarios of the switching function. Finally, we perform
a case study of a soft robot to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
control algorithm.

Abstract: This paper addresses the global optimization of the sum of the Rayleigh
quotient and the generalized Rayleigh quotient on the unit sphere. While
various methods have been proposed for this problem, they do not guarantee
convergence to the global maximizer. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
a probability-one homotopy optimization method that, under certain conditions,
guarantees convergence to the global maximizer. The proposed method is analyzed
alongside state-of-the-art approaches through numerical experiments, evaluating
their performance in terms of convergence speed and ability to reach the global
maximizer. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this ties in with the multi-source
Bayesian Generalized Total Least-Squares (B-GTLS) problem, illustrating its
applicability.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for computing the optimal feedback
gain of the infinite-horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem via an
ordinary differential equation. We introduce a novel continuous-time Bellman
error, derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which
quantifies the suboptimality of stabilizing policies and is parametrized in
terms of the feedback gain. We analyze its properties, including its effective
domain, smoothness, coerciveness and show the existence of a unique stationary
point within the stability region. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form
gradient expression of the Bellman error that induces a gradient flow. This
converges to the optimal feedback and generates a unique trajectory which
exclusively comprises stabilizing feedback policies. Additionally, this work
advances interesting connections between LQR theory and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) by redefining suboptimality of the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) as a
Bellman error, adapting a state-independent formulation, and leveraging
Lyapunov equations to overcome the infinite-horizon challenge. We validate our
method in a simulation and compare it to the state of the art.
