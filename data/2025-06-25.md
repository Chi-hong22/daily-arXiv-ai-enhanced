### [1] [FORTE: Tactile Force and Slip Sensing on Compliant Fingers for Delicate Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18960)
*Siqi Shang,Mingyo Seo,Yuke Zhu,Lilly Chin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FORTE是一种嵌入柔性夹爪中的触觉传感系统，通过3D打印的鳍射线夹爪和内部空气通道实现低延迟力和滑动反馈，适用于抓取易碎物品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刚性平行夹爪在抓取易碎物品时依赖视觉反馈，缺乏响应性和适应性。触觉传感和软机器人技术可以解决这一问题，但现有方法集成复杂或响应慢。

Method: FORTE采用3D打印的鳍射线夹爪，内部设计空气通道，提供低延迟的力和滑动反馈，确保抓取力度适中且不损坏物品。

Result: FORTE能准确估计0-8N的抓取力（平均误差0.2N），并在100ms内检测滑动事件。抓取易碎物品（如覆盆子、薯片）成功率达98.6%，滑动检测准确率93%。

Conclusion: FORTE是一种实用且稳健的解决方案，适用于精细机器人操作。

Abstract: Handling delicate and fragile objects remains a major challenge for robotic
manipulation, especially for rigid parallel grippers. While the simplicity and
versatility of parallel grippers have led to widespread adoption, these
grippers are limited by their heavy reliance on visual feedback. Tactile
sensing and soft robotics can add responsiveness and compliance. However,
existing methods typically involve high integration complexity or suffer from
slow response times. In this work, we introduce FORTE, a tactile sensing system
embedded in compliant gripper fingers. FORTE uses 3D-printed fin-ray grippers
with internal air channels to provide low-latency force and slip feedback.
FORTE applies just enough force to grasp objects without damaging them, while
remaining easy to fabricate and integrate. We find that FORTE can accurately
estimate grasping forces from 0-8 N with an average error of 0.2 N, and detect
slip events within 100 ms of occurring. We demonstrate FORTE's ability to grasp
a wide range of slippery, fragile, and deformable objects. In particular, FORTE
grasps fragile objects like raspberries and potato chips with a 98.6% success
rate, and achieves 93% accuracy in detecting slip events. These results
highlight FORTE's potential as a robust and practical solution for enabling
delicate robotic manipulation. Project page: https://merge-lab.github.io/FORTE

### [2] [Faster Motion Planning via Restarts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19016)
*Nancy Amato,Stav Ashur,Sariel Har-Peled%*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出通过随机重启技术改进PRM和RRT等随机运动规划算法，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机方法如PRM和RRT在某些情况下性能不稳定，导致简单实例下表现不佳。

Method: 应用新的随机重启技术加速Las Vegas算法。

Result: 实验显示新算法运行更快、路径更短，且多线程性能更优。

Conclusion: 新算法被证明最优，且易于部署和使用。

Abstract: Randomized methods such as PRM and RRT are widely used in motion planning.
However, in some cases, their running-time suffers from inherent instability,
leading to ``catastrophic'' performance even for relatively simple instances.
We apply stochastic restart techniques, some of them new, for speeding up Las
Vegas algorithms, that provide dramatic speedups in practice (a factor of $3$
[or larger] in many cases).
  Our experiments demonstrate that the new algorithms have faster runtimes,
shorter paths, and greater gains from multi-threading (when compared with
straightforward parallel implementation). We prove the optimality of the new
variants. Our implementation is open source, available on github, and is easy
to deploy and use.

### [3] [Multimodal Anomaly Detection with a Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19077)
*Christoph Willibald,Daniel Sliwowski,Dongheui Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合专家框架，结合视觉语言模型和高斯混合回归检测器，用于机器人操作中的多模态异常检测，显著减少检测延迟并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作中异常检测的挑战包括机器人驱动和环境驱动的异常，传统方法无法同时有效处理这两类异常。

Method: 采用混合专家框架，结合视觉语言模型和高斯混合回归检测器，并引入基于置信度的动态融合机制。

Result: 在家庭和工业任务中，检测延迟减少60%，帧级异常检测性能优于单一检测器。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效整合互补检测机制，显著提升机器人操作中的异常检测能力。

Abstract: With a growing number of robots being deployed across diverse applications,
robust multimodal anomaly detection becomes increasingly important. In robotic
manipulation, failures typically arise from (1) robot-driven anomalies due to
an insufficient task model or hardware limitations, and (2) environment-driven
anomalies caused by dynamic environmental changes or external interferences.
Conventional anomaly detection methods focus either on the first by low-level
statistical modeling of proprioceptive signals or the second by deep
learning-based visual environment observation, each with different
computational and training data requirements. To effectively capture anomalies
from both sources, we propose a mixture-of-experts framework that integrates
the complementary detection mechanisms with a visual-language model for
environment monitoring and a Gaussian-mixture regression-based detector for
tracking deviations in interaction forces and robot motions. We introduce a
confidence-based fusion mechanism that dynamically selects the most reliable
detector for each situation. We evaluate our approach on both household and
industrial tasks using two robotic systems, demonstrating a 60% reduction in
detection delay while improving frame-wise anomaly detection performance
compared to individual detectors.

### [4] [Analysis and experiments of the dissipative Twistcar: direction reversal and asymptotic approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19112)
*Rom Levy,Ari Dantus,Zitao Yu,Yizhar Or*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文研究了考虑滚动摩擦能量耗散的Twistcar两连杆模型，揭示了通过改变几何和质量属性可能逆转运动方向的现象，并设计了一个机器人原型验证了这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往对Twistcar的研究未考虑摩擦导致的能量耗散，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 建立理论两连杆模型，结合滚动阻力，分析小振幅稳态周期动力学，并设计机器人原型进行实验验证。

Result: 发现通过改变几何和质量属性可逆转运动方向，并通过实验验证了这一现象。

Conclusion: 摩擦对Twistcar动力学有显著影响，方向逆转现象可通过调整参数实现。

Abstract: Underactuated wheeled vehicles are commonly studied as nonholonomic systems
with periodic actuation. Twistcar is a classical example inspired by a riding
toy, which has been analyzed using a planar model of a dynamical system with
nonholonomic constraints. Most of the previous analyses did not account for
energy dissipation due to friction. In this work, we study a theoretical
two-link model of the Twistcar while incorporating dissipation due to rolling
resistance. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the system's small-amplitude
steady-state periodic dynamics, which reveals the possibility of reversing the
direction of motion upon varying the geometric and mass properties of the
vehicle. Next, we design and construct a robotic prototype of the Twistcar
whose center-of-mass position can be shifted by adding and removing a massive
block, enabling demonstration of the Twistcar's direction reversal phenomenon.
We also conduct parameter fitting for the frictional resistance in order to
improve agreement with experiments.

### [5] [CUPID: Curating Data your Robot Loves with Influence Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19121)
*Christopher Agia,Rohan Sinha,Jingyun Yang,Rika Antonova,Marco Pavone,Haruki Nishimura,Masha Itkina,Jeannette Bohg*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CUPID是一种基于影响函数理论的机器人数据筛选方法，通过评估训练数据对策略性能的影响，优化演示数据的选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人模仿学习中，演示数据的质量和组成对策略性能至关重要，但如何精确评估单个演示对任务成功的影响仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出CUPID方法，通过影响函数理论估计每个训练演示对策略预期回报的影响，从而筛选和优化数据。

Result: 实验表明，CUPID能显著提升策略性能，仅用33%的筛选数据即可达到SOTA水平，并在硬件实验中验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CUPID为机器人模仿学习提供了一种高效的数据筛选方法，能够显著提升策略性能并适应分布变化。

Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the
quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise
understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream
outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent
challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel
influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given
a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training
demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and
selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's
closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out
training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly
collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated
and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which
data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of
curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated
RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore,
hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under
distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the
post-training of generalist robot policies. Additional materials are made

### [6] [Situated Haptic Interaction: Exploring the Role of Context in Affective Perception of Robotic Touch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19179)
*Qiaoqiao Ren,Tony Belpaeme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了情境情绪线索如何影响对机器人触觉信号的感知，发现视觉情境常主导触觉信号的效价感知，触觉反馈能增强交互的效价感知并调节唤醒度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感计算中触觉反馈在动态情绪交流中的作用尚未充分探索，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 32名参与者观看机器人经历积极、消极或中性动作的视频，随后通过可穿戴振动袖接收机器人触觉反馈，评估其情绪状态。

Result: 视觉情境主导触觉效价感知，消极触觉增强交互效价，积极触觉弱化效价，触觉还调节唤醒度感知。

Conclusion: 情境触觉反馈能丰富人机情感交互，为机器情感交流提供更细致和具身化的方法。

Abstract: Affective interaction is not merely about recognizing emotions; it is an
embodied, situated process shaped by context and co-created through
interaction. In affective computing, the role of haptic feedback within dynamic
emotional exchanges remains underexplored. This study investigates how
situational emotional cues influence the perception and interpretation of
haptic signals given by a robot. In a controlled experiment, 32 participants
watched video scenarios in which a robot experienced either positive actions
(such as being kissed), negative actions (such as being slapped) or neutral
actions. After each video, the robot conveyed its emotional response through
haptic communication, delivered via a wearable vibration sleeve worn by the
participant. Participants rated the robot's emotional state-its valence
(positive or negative) and arousal (intensity)-based on the video, the haptic
feedback, and the combination of the two. The study reveals a dynamic interplay
between visual context and touch. Participants' interpretation of haptic
feedback was strongly shaped by the emotional context of the video, with visual
context often overriding the perceived valence of the haptic signal. Negative
haptic cues amplified the perceived valence of the interaction, while positive
cues softened it. Furthermore, haptics override the participants' perception of
arousal of the video. Together, these results offer insights into how situated
haptic feedback can enrich affective human-robot interaction, pointing toward
more nuanced and embodied approaches to emotional communication with machines.

### [7] [The MOTIF Hand: A Robotic Hand for Multimodal Observations with Thermal, Inertial, and Force Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19201)
*Hanyang Zhou,Haozhe Lou,Wenhao Liu,Enyu Zhao,Yue Wang,Daniel Seita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MOTIF的多模态机器人手，集成了多种传感器，用于增强灵巧操作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人手缺乏热感和扭矩感知能力，限制了灵巧操作的应用。

Method: 扩展了LEAP手的设计，集成了密集触觉、深度传感器、热像仪、IMU和视觉传感器。

Result: 验证了热感引导的安全抓取和区分外观相同但质量不同的物体的能力。

Conclusion: MOTIF手是一种低成本、易复制的多模态机器人手，扩展了灵巧操作的功能。

Abstract: Advancing dexterous manipulation with multi-fingered robotic hands requires
rich sensory capabilities, while existing designs lack onboard thermal and
torque sensing. In this work, we propose the MOTIF hand, a novel multimodal and
versatile robotic hand that extends the LEAP hand by integrating: (i) dense
tactile information across the fingers, (ii) a depth sensor, (iii) a thermal
camera, (iv), IMU sensors, and (v) a visual sensor. The MOTIF hand is designed
to be relatively low-cost (under 4000 USD) and easily reproducible. We validate
our hand design through experiments that leverage its multimodal sensing for
two representative tasks. First, we integrate thermal sensing into 3D
reconstruction to guide temperature-aware, safe grasping. Second, we show how
our hand can distinguish objects with identical appearance but different masses
- a capability beyond methods that use vision only.

### [8] [Preserving Sense of Agency: User Preferences for Robot Autonomy and User Control across Household Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19202)
*Claire Yang,Heer Patel,Max Kleiman-Weiner,Maya Cakmak*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了用户对辅助机器人自主性的偏好及其对用户控制感的影响，发现用户在高风险任务中更倾向于控制机器人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨用户对机器人自主性的偏好及其对用户控制感的影响，以改进辅助机器人设计。

Method: 通过实验让参与者评估四种不同自主性水平下对机器人的控制感，并针对不同家庭任务进行偏好排序。

Result: 用户控制感受到机器人自主性和第三方参与的影响；高风险任务中用户更倾向于控制机器人。

Conclusion: 辅助机器人设计应考虑用户对控制的需求，尤其是在高风险任务中。

Abstract: Roboticists often design with the assumption that assistive robots should be
fully autonomous. However, it remains unclear whether users prefer highly
autonomous robots, as prior work in assistive robotics suggests otherwise. High
robot autonomy can reduce the user's sense of agency, which represents feeling
in control of one's environment. How much control do users, in fact, want over
the actions of robots used for in-home assistance? We investigate how robot
autonomy levels affect users' sense of agency and the autonomy level they
prefer in contexts with varying risks. Our study asked participants to rate
their sense of agency as robot users across four distinct autonomy levels and
ranked their robot preferences with respect to various household tasks. Our
findings revealed that participants' sense of agency was primarily influenced
by two factors: (1) whether the robot acts autonomously, and (2) whether a
third party is involved in the robot's programming or operation. Notably, an
end-user programmed robot highly preserved users' sense of agency, even though
it acts autonomously. However, in high-risk settings, e.g., preparing a snack
for a child with allergies, they preferred robots that prioritized their
control significantly more. Additional contextual factors, such as trust in a
third party operator, also shaped their preferences.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用视觉语言模型（VLM）生成任务相关轨迹的方法，用于训练灵巧机器人手的强化学习策略，无需人工演示或手工设计奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵巧机器人手的训练面临数据收集和高维控制的挑战，传统强化学习依赖任务特定的奖励函数，限制了扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用现成的VLM识别任务关键点并合成3D轨迹，训练低层强化学习策略跟踪这些轨迹。

Result: 在模拟任务中成功学习到鲁棒的灵巧操作策略，并能迁移到真实机器人手。

Conclusion: 该方法通过VLM生成的轨迹有效解决了灵巧操作中的数据瓶颈问题，展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands are essential for performing complex manipulation
tasks, yet remain difficult to train due to the challenges of demonstration
collection and high-dimensional control. While reinforcement learning (RL) can
alleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it
typically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which
hinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous
manipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories. These
trajectories specify target hand poses that guide the exploration of RL
policies and object poses that enable dense, task-agnostic rewards. However,
sourcing suitable trajectories - particularly for dexterous hands - remains a
significant challenge. Yet, the precise details in explicit reference
trajectories are often unnecessary, as RL ultimately refines the motion. Our
key insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the
commonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide
exploration effectively. Given a task description (e.g., "open the cabinet")
and a visual scene, our method uses an off-the-shelf VLM to first identify
task-relevant keypoints (e.g., handles, buttons) and then synthesize 3D
trajectories for hand motion and object motion. Subsequently, we train a
low-level residual RL policy in simulation to track these coarse trajectories
or "scaffolds" with high fidelity. Across a number of simulated tasks involving
articulated objects and semantic understanding, we demonstrate that our method
is able to learn robust dexterous manipulation policies. Moreover, we showcase
that our method transfers to real-world robotic hands without any human
demonstrations or handcrafted rewards.

*Ziyan Zhao,Ke Fan,He-Yang Xu,Ning Qiao,Bo Peng,Wenlong Gao,Dongjiang Li,Hui Shen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AnchorDP3是一个用于双臂机器人操作的扩散策略框架，通过三项创新技术在高度随机化环境中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在高度随机化环境中机器人操作的挑战，减少对人类演示的依赖。

Method: 结合模拟器监督语义分割、任务条件特征编码器和基于关键姿态扩散的动作预测。

Result: 在RoboTwin基准测试中达到98.7%的平均成功率。

Conclusion: AnchorDP3框架有望实现完全自主的视觉运动策略生成，无需人类演示。

Abstract: We present AnchorDP3, a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic
manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly randomized
environments. AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1)
Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to
explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides
strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight
modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient
multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3)
Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing
dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action
anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to
affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is
forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses
simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence
and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation
data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark
across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table
height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the
RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous
generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction,
totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人系统在几何推理和动态稳定性上表现优异，但在关系语义表示、上下文推理和认知透明度方面存在不足，难以适应动态、以人为中心的环境。

Method: 通过ONN（Ontology Neural Network）和ORTSF（Ontological Real-Time Semantic Fabric）的结合，ONN利用动态拓扑过程实现关系语义推理，ORTSF则将推理痕迹转化为控制命令并补偿系统延迟。

Result: 实验表明，ONN + ORTSF框架能够统一语义认知和鲁棒控制，为认知机器人提供数学上严谨且实际可行的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了现有机器人系统在语义推理和认知透明度上的空白，为动态、人机协作环境提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of autonomous robotic systems has led to impressive
capabilities in perception, localization, mapping, and control. Yet, a
fundamental gap remains: existing frameworks excel at geometric reasoning and
dynamic stability but fall short in representing and preserving relational
semantics, contextual reasoning, and cognitive transparency essential for
collaboration in dynamic, human-centric environments. This paper introduces a
unified architecture comprising the Ontology Neural Network (ONN) and the
Ontological Real-Time Semantic Fabric (ORTSF) to address this gap. The ONN
formalizes relational semantic reasoning as a dynamic topological process. By
embedding Forman-Ricci curvature, persistent homology, and semantic tensor
structures within a unified loss formulation, ONN ensures that relational
integrity and topological coherence are preserved as scenes evolve over time.
The ORTSF transforms reasoning traces into actionable control commands while
compensating for system delays. It integrates predictive and delay-aware
operators that ensure phase margin preservation and continuity of control
signals, even under significant latency conditions. Empirical studies
demonstrate the ONN + ORTSF framework's ability to unify semantic cognition and
robust control, providing a mathematically principled and practically viable
solution for cognitive robotics.

model. Our physical reasoning framework, which employs a hierarchical feature
alignment mechanism and a refined prompting strategy, enables our model to make
property-specific predictions that strongly correlate with ground-truth
measurements. Evaluated on 35 diverse objects, our approach outperforms
existing baselines and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization. Keywords:

Abstract: Inertial parameter identification of industrial robots is an established
process, but standard methods using Least Squares or Machine Learning do not
consider prior information about the robot and require extensive measurements.
Inspired by Bayesian statistics, this paper presents an identification method
with improved generalization that incorporates prior knowledge and is able to
learn with only a few or without additional measurements (Zero-Shot Learning).
Furthermore, our method is able to correctly learn not only the inertial but

Abstract: Soft robots, compared to rigid robots, possess inherent advantages, including
higher degrees of freedom, compliance, and enhanced safety, which have
contributed to their increasing application across various fields. Among these
benefits, adaptability is particularly noteworthy. In this paper, adaptability
in soft robots is categorized into external and internal adaptability. External
adaptability refers to the robot's ability to adjust, either passively or
actively, to variations in environments, object properties, geometries, and
task dynamics. Internal adaptability refers to the robot's ability to cope with
internal variations, such as manufacturing tolerances or material aging, and to
generalize control strategies across different robots. As the field of soft
robotics continues to evolve, the significance of adaptability has become
increasingly pronounced. In this review, we summarize various approaches to
enhancing the adaptability of soft robots, including design, sensing, and
control strategies. Additionally, we assess the impact of adaptability on
applications such as surgery, wearable devices, locomotion, and manipulation.
We also discuss the limitations of soft robotics adaptability and prospective
directions for future research. By analyzing adaptability through the lenses of
implementation, application, and challenges, this paper aims to provide a
comprehensive understanding of this essential characteristic in soft robotics
and its implications for diverse applications.

Abstract: The ground effect on multicopters introduces several challenges, such as
control errors caused by additional lift, oscillations that may occur during
near-ground flight due to external torques, and the influence of ground airflow
on models such as the rotor drag and the mixing matrix. This article collects
and analyzes the dynamics data of near-ground multicopter flight through
various methods, including force measurement platforms and real-world flights.
For the first time, we summarize the mathematical model of the external torque
of multicopters under ground effect. The influence of ground airflow on rotor
drag and the mixing matrix is also verified through adequate experimentation
and analysis. Through simplification and derivation, the differential flatness
of the multicopter's dynamic model under ground effect is confirmed. To
mitigate the influence of these disturbance models on control, we propose a
control method that combines dynamic inverse and disturbance models, ensuring
consistent control effectiveness at both high and low altitudes. In this
method, the additional thrust and variations in rotor drag under ground effect
are both considered and compensated through feedforward models. The leveling
torque of ground effect can be equivalently represented as variations in the
center of gravity and the moment of inertia. In this way, the leveling torque
does not explicitly appear in the dynamic model. The final experimental results
show that the method proposed in this paper reduces the control error (RMSE) by
\textbf{45.3\%}. Please check the supplementary material at:

TL;DR: T-Rex是一个任务自适应的空间表示提取框架，通过动态选择最适合任务需求的表示方案，提升机器人操作系统的空间理解能力和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VLM的机器人方法采用固定的空间表示提取方案，导致表示能力不足或提取时间过长。

Method: 提出T-Rex框架，根据任务复杂度动态选择空间表示的类型和粒度。

Result: 实验表明，T-Rex在空间理解、效率和稳定性方面具有显著优势，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: T-Rex为通用机器人操作系统提供了一种高效且灵活的空间表示解决方案。

Abstract: Building a general robotic manipulation system capable of performing a wide
variety of tasks in real-world settings is a challenging task. Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation
tasks, primarily due to the extensive world knowledge they gain from
large-scale datasets. In this process, Spatial Representations (such as points
representing object positions or vectors representing object orientations) act
as a bridge between VLMs and real-world scene, effectively grounding the
reasoning abilities of VLMs and applying them to specific task scenarios.
However, existing VLM-based robotic approaches often adopt a fixed spatial
representation extraction scheme for various tasks, resulting in insufficient
representational capability or excessive extraction time. In this work, we
introduce T-Rex, a Task-Adaptive Framework for Spatial Representation
Extraction, which dynamically selects the most appropriate spatial
representation extraction scheme for each entity based on specific task
requirements. Our key insight is that task complexity determines the types and
granularity of spatial representations, and Stronger representational
capabilities are typically associated with Higher overall system operation
costs. Through comprehensive experiments in real-world robotic environments, we
show that our approach delivers significant advantages in spatial
understanding, efficiency, and stability without additional training.

Result: VLMs在常见物体识别中表现良好，但对新颖表征泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 为实际部署VLMs于机器人场景提供了实用建议，但需注意其泛化限制。

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models
(VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this
work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop
scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot
collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several
models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various
captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs
between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between
recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate
object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated
captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common
objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations.
Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for
embodied agents in real-world settings.

Abstract: As labor shortages and productivity stagnation increasingly challenge the
construction industry, automation has become essential for sustainable
infrastructure development. This paper presents an autonomous payload
transportation system as an initial step toward fully unmanned construction
sites. Our system, based on the CD110R-3 crawler carrier, integrates autonomous

begun fundamental investigations into external-sensor based perception and
mapping system. Preliminary results highlight the potential challenges,
including navigation in evolving terrain, environmental perception under
construction-specific conditions, and sensor placement optimization for
improving autonomy and efficiency. Looking forward, we envision a construction
ecosystem where collaborative autonomous agents dynamically adapt to site
conditions, optimizing workflow and reducing human intervention. This paper
provides foundational insights into the future of robotics-driven construction
automation and identifies critical areas for further technological development.

Abstract: Trans-catheter cardiac intervention has become an increasingly available

However, current catheterbased platforms suffer from a lack of dexterity, force

intracardiac procedures is the implantation of anchor coils, which can be used
to fix and implant various devices in the beating heart. We introduce a robotic
platform capable of delivering anchor coils. We develop a kineto-statics model
of the robotic platform and demonstrate low positional error. We leverage the
passive compliance and high force output of the actuator in a multi-anchor
delivery procedure against a motile in-vitro simulator with millimeter level

Abstract: Continued adoption of agricultural robots postulates the farmer's trust in
the reliability, robustness and safety of the new technology. This motivates
our work on safety assurance of agricultural robots, particularly their ability
to detect, track and avoid obstacles and humans. This paper considers a
probabilistic modelling and risk analysis framework for use in the early
development phases. Starting off with hazard identification and a risk
assessment matrix, the behaviour of the mobile robot platform, sensor and
perception system, and any humans present are captured using three state
machines. An auto-generated probabilistic model is then solved and analysed
using the probabilistic model checker PRISM. The result provides unique insight
into fundamental development and engineering aspects by quantifying the effect
of the risk mitigation actions and risk reduction associated with distinct
design concepts. These include implications of adopting a higher performance
and more expensive Object Detection System or opting for a more elaborate
warning system to increase human awareness. Although this paper mainly focuses
on the initial concept-development phase, the proposed safety assurance
framework can also be used during implementation, and subsequent deployment and
operation phases.

Result: 在农业现场机器人上的应用表明，该方法能有效验证安全关键属性，并早期识别设计问题。

Conclusion: 该工作流程有助于开发更安全的自主机器人系统。

Abstract: Autonomous robots deployed in shared human environments, such as agricultural
settings, require rigorous safety assurance to meet both functional reliability
and regulatory compliance. These systems must operate in dynamic, unstructured
environments, interact safely with humans, and respond effectively to a wide
range of potential hazards. This paper presents a verification workflow for the
safety assurance of an autonomous agricultural robot, covering the entire
development life-cycle, from concept study and design to runtime verification.
The outlined methodology begins with a systematic hazard analysis and risk
assessment to identify potential risks and derive corresponding safety
requirements. A formal model of the safety controller is then developed to
capture its behaviour and verify that the controller satisfies the specified
safety properties with respect to these requirements. The proposed approach is
demonstrated on a field robot operating in an agricultural setting. The results
show that the methodology can be effectively used to verify safety-critical
properties and facilitate the early identification of design issues,
contributing to the development of safer robots and autonomous systems.

Motivation: 解决非光学触觉传感器数据通用性不足的问题。

Method: 使用传感器特定编码器创建传感器无关的潜在空间，通过联合自编码器训练实现数据对齐。

Result: 模型在两种商业触觉传感器上表现良好，支持跨传感器数据转换和下游任务应用。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨传感器触觉数据通用化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable algorithms for tactile sensing remain underexplored, primarily
due to the diversity of sensor modalities. Recently, many methods for
cross-sensor transfer between optical (vision-based) tactile sensors have been
investigated, yet little work focus on non-optical tactile sensors. To address
this gap, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture to unify tactile data
across non-vision-based sensors. By leveraging sensor-specific encoders, the
framework creates a latent space that is sensor-agnostic, enabling cross-sensor
data transfer with low errors and direct use in downstream applications. We
leverage this network to unify tactile data from two commercial tactile
sensors: the Xela uSkin uSPa 46 and the Contactile PapillArray. Both were
mounted on a UR5e robotic arm, performing force-controlled pressing sequences
against distinct object shapes (circular, square, and hexagonal prisms) and two
materials (rigid PLA and flexible TPU). Another more complex unseen object was
also included to investigate the model's generalization capabilities. We show
that alignment in latent space can be implicitly learned from joint autoencoder
training with matching contacts collected via different sensors. We further
demonstrate the practical utility of our approach through contact geometry
estimation, where downstream models trained on one sensor's latent
representation can be directly applied to another without retraining.

Conclusion: SBE和IPP方法能有效估计和优化GPS偏差，提高定位精度。

Abstract: External factors, including urban canyons and adversarial interference, can
lead to Global Positioning System (GPS) inaccuracies that vary as a function of
the position in the environment. This study addresses the challenge of
estimating a static, spatially-varying error function using a team of robots.
We introduce a State Bias Estimation Algorithm (SBE) whose purpose is to
estimate the GPS biases. The central idea is to use sensed estimates of the
range and bearing to the other robots in the team to estimate changes in bias
across the environment. A set of drones moves in a 2D environment, each
sampling data from GPS, range, and bearing sensors. The biases calculated by
the SBE at estimated positions are used to train a Gaussian Process Regression
(GPR) model. We use a Sparse Gaussian process-based Informative Path Planning
(IPP) algorithm that identifies high-value regions of the environment for data
collection. The swarm plans paths that maximize information gain in each
iteration, further refining their understanding of the environment's positional
bias landscape. We evaluated SBE and IPP in simulation and compared the IPP
methodology to an open-loop strategy.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals show promise for effective
human-computer interfaces, particularly in rehabilitation and prosthetics.
However, challenges remain in developing systems that respond quickly and
reliably to user intent, across different subjects and without requiring
time-consuming calibration. In this work, we propose a framework for EMG-based
intent detection that addresses these challenges. Unlike traditional gesture
recognition models that wait until a gesture is completed before classifying
it, our approach uses a segmentation strategy to assign intent labels at every
timestep as the gesture unfolds. We introduce a novel masked modeling strategy
that aligns muscle activations with their corresponding user intents, enabling
rapid onset detection and stable tracking of ongoing gestures. In evaluations
against baseline methods, considering both accuracy and stability for device
control, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
transfer conditions, demonstrating its potential for wearable robotics and
next-generation prosthetic systems. Our project page is available at:

TL;DR: CronusVLA扩展单帧视觉语言动作模型至多帧范式，通过高效后训练阶段提升性能，减少计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言动作模型受限于单帧观测，无法充分利用多帧运动信息，计算成本高。

Method: 1. 单帧预训练；2. 多帧编码；3. 跨帧解码。

Result: 在SimperEnv上成功率70.9%，LIBERO上比OpenVLA提升12.7%，真实机器人实验表现优异。

Conclusion: CronusVLA高效且性能优越，适用于多帧任务。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across
manipulation tasks. However, they remain constrained by a single-frame
observation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information
offered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large
vision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and
inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends
single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient
post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame
pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens
prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)
multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from
discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating
motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame
decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared
decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and
caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an
application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation
mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during
finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with
70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world
Franka experiments also show the strong performance and robustness.

Abstract: In Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments such as

improved robustness under various conditions, achieving positioning accuracy
improvements of approximately 88% on average. This work highlights the

Abstract: Multi-task robotic bimanual manipulation is becoming increasingly popular as
it enables sophisticated tasks that require diverse dual-arm collaboration
patterns. Compared to unimanual manipulation, bimanual tasks pose challenges to
understanding the multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics. An existing method
ManiGaussian pioneers encoding the spatiotemporal dynamics into the visual
representation via Gaussian world model for single-arm settings, which ignores
the interaction of multiple embodiments for dual-arm systems with significant
performance drop. In this paper, we propose ManiGaussian++, an extension of
ManiGaussian framework that improves multi-task bimanual manipulation by
digesting multi-body scene dynamics through a hierarchical Gaussian world
model. To be specific, we first generate task-oriented Gaussian Splatting from
intermediate visual features, which aims to differentiate acting and
stabilizing arms for multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics modeling. We then build
a hierarchical Gaussian world model with the leader-follower architecture,
where the multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics is mined for intermediate visual
representation via future scene prediction. The leader predicts Gaussian
Splatting deformation caused by motions of the stabilizing arm, through which
the follower generates the physical consequences resulted from the movement of
the acting arm. As a result, our method significantly outperforms the current
state-of-the-art bimanual manipulation techniques by an improvement of 20.2% in
10 simulated tasks, and achieves 60% success rate on average in 9 challenging
real-world tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging
environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

Motivation: 解决YOLOv8在细粒度识别任务（如车牌识别和车辆属性分类）上的不足，为智能交通系统提供可扩展的碳排放监测方案。

Method: 采用混合管道，结合YOLOv8进行车辆检测与分割，通过专用OCR模块识别车牌，并利用外部数据库验证信息。

Conclusion: 该系统为智能交通中的碳排放监测提供了高效、精确的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

Result: 视频分析特征与四种运动缺陷对应，且能进一步细分序列效应和犹豫-停顿缺陷，预测MDS-UPDRS评分的准确性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为PD运动特征的客观评估提供了实用解决方案，未来需验证其对症状治疗和疾病进展的响应性。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂形态和环境变化的管状结构时存在计算效率低和对先验知识依赖性强的问题。

Method: 将分段跟踪建模为马尔可夫决策过程，利用Q-Learning动态探索分段图，按需计算边权重并自适应扩展搜索空间。

Result: 在典型管状结构数据集上，该方法显著优于现有方法，有效处理复杂拓扑并保持全局路径一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖大量先验知识，计算高效且适应性强，为管状结构跟踪提供了新思路。

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation
procedure, and importantly, the application of automation technologies to the
safety issues is imperative ahead of the utilization of any other advances.
Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the
human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building
top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular
Integrated Construction (MiC) lifted. Also, the camera and Light Detection And
Ranging (LiDAR) can capture abundant 3D information on site, which is however
yet made the best use. Considering the safety protection for humans and tower
cranes, we present an AI-based fully automated safety monitoring system for
tower crane lifting from the bird's-eye view, surveilling to shield the human
workers on the construction top and avoid cranes' collision by alarming the
crane operator. The system achieved a 3D data fusion for localization of humans

state-of-the-art methods were explored and implemented into our proposed
software pipeline coupled with the hardware and display systems. Furthermore,
we conducted an analysis of the components in the pipeline to verify the
accuracy and effectiveness of the involved methods. The display and
visualization on the real site proved that our system can serve as a valuable
safety monitoring toolkit on site.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练通用的城市时空基础模型以适用于不同地区和数据稀缺场景，现有方法因计算复杂性和内存开销大而受限。

Method: 提出Damba-ST模型，结合域自适应状态空间模型和三种域适配器，提升跨域泛化能力。

Result: Damba-ST在预测任务中表现优异，具备零样本泛化能力，适用于新城市环境。

Conclusion: Damba-ST在高效性和泛化性上优于现有方法，为城市时空预测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖计算密集的卷积和自注意力机制，限制了效率和可扩展性。

Method: 引入频谱字典标记混合器，将图像块或词片段表示为稀疏频率原子的组合。

Result: SDict-VLM在MS-COCO和VQAv2上表现优异，性能接近BLIP-2但参数更少、速度更快。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效且可解释的视觉语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，DiffRIS在所有标准指标上均优于现有方法，确立了新的性能标杆。

Conclusion: DiffRIS通过预训练扩散模型和自适应框架，显著提升了遥感图像分割的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

Conclusion: GLIMPSE为分析LVLM的跨模态推理提供了细粒度洞察，有助于诊断幻觉和偏见。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

Conclusion: T2MD证明了Mamba模型在非因果视觉输出生成中的可行性，为未来探索提供了潜力。

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

Result: 实验表明，OoPk在多个持续TTA基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OoPk有效缓解了灾难性遗忘和错误积累，提升了语义分割任务的性能。

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero

visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

### [46] [Lightweight RGB-T Tracking with Mobile Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19154)
*Mahdi Falaki,Maria A. Amer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MobileViT的轻量级RGB-T跟踪算法，通过渐进式融合框架和可分离注意力实现高效的多模态跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单模态跟踪在低光照和恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，多模态跟踪（如RGB-T）利用互补数据提升性能，但现有Transformer模型计算成本高。

Method: 采用MobileViT，设计渐进式融合框架，结合可分离注意力学习模态内和模态间交互，生成高效特征表示。

Result: 模型参数少于400万，GPU推理速度达122帧/秒，性能与现有高效多模态跟踪器相当。

Conclusion: 首次将MobileViT用于RGB-T跟踪，实现了轻量化和高效性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

*Mert Can Cakmak,Nitin Agarwal,Diwash Poudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级、感知对齐的关键帧提取框架，用于在线视频中的突出时刻检测，适用于内容审核和摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频在政治话语和网络社会威胁（如错误信息和激进化）中扮演重要角色，检测视频中的突出时刻对内容审核和法医分析至关重要。

Method: PRISM在CIELAB色彩空间中使用感知颜色差异度量，无需训练，计算高效，适合实时和资源受限环境。

Result: 在BBC、TVSum、SumMe和ClipShots四个基准数据集上，PRISM表现出高准确性和压缩比。

Conclusion: PRISM是一种可扩展的工具，适用于结构化和非结构化视频内容，能有效分析和审核有害或政治敏感媒体。

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球心血管事件是主要死亡原因，现有风险评估方法受限于单模态数据和采样偏差。多模态数据整合有望提供更全面的风险预测。

Method: 提出MOSCARD框架，结合胸部X光片和心电图数据，采用多模态对齐、因果推理和双反向传播图技术。

Conclusion: MOSCARD为低成本、高效的心血管事件筛查提供了新方法，有助于早期干预和改善患者预后。

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing
disparities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化方法在特定场景下表现良好，但难以泛化到不同物种和环境，OW 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用语言感知嵌入和 Grounding-DINO 框架，结合高效搜索算法（k近邻和广度优先搜索）。

Result: 在15个数据集上训练，OW 表现优异（mAP50 达0.981），高效搜索算法可覆盖95%物种且仅需探索33%图像。

Conclusion: OW 是一个灵活、经济高效的全球生物多样性评估解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed
for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing
automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to
generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic
coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages
language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

Result: 总结了古代文字识别的共同挑战和方法重叠，并提出了针对性的解决方案。

Conclusion: 论文为古代文字的识别、解释和破译提供了结构化、前瞻性的视角，支持该领域的持续发展。

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

TL;DR: MedErr-CT是一个新的基准测试，用于评估医学多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在CT报告中识别和纠正错误的能力，通过视觉问答框架实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CT检查需求增加，诊断错误问题日益突出，而现有医学视觉问答基准缺乏临床相关性，无法评估专家级知识。

Method: 引入MedErr-CT基准，包含六类错误（四种视觉相关错误和两种词汇错误），并分为分类、检测和纠正三个任务级别。

Result: 评估了先进的3D医学MLLMs，发现它们在不同错误类型上的表现差异显著。

Conclusion: MedErr-CT有助于开发更可靠且临床适用的MLLMs，减少诊断错误并提高临床准确性。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临高计算和内存成本的问题，难以兼顾性能与效率。

Method: 提出Video-XL-2，采用分块预填充和双层KV解码技术：分块内全注意力、分块间稀疏注意力，任务相关选择加载密集或稀疏KV。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准测试中达到最优性能，单GPU可处理超万帧视频，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: Video-XL-2通过创新设计解决了长视频处理的高成本问题，实现了高性能与高效率的平衡。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法主要针对单模态语言模型，无法应对多模态输入带来的复杂安全风险。

Method: 提出MSR-Align数据集，支持跨视觉和文本模态的细粒度安全推理，并通过多模态多样性、政策基础推理和严格质量过滤生成数据。

Result: 实验表明，基于MSR-Align微调的视觉语言模型显著提升了对抗文本和视觉语言攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持或增强一般推理性能。

Conclusion: MSR-Align为提升多模态视觉语言模型的安全性提供了可扩展且有效的基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective
foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our
dataset is made publicly available at

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image
Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR
empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of
5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在遥感变化检测中因无法有效捕获图像通道间的长距离依赖而受限，需改进特征表示能力。

Method: 提出3D-SSM捕获全局信息，结合SIM实现双时相特征交互，MBFEM整合频域、空域和3D-SSM特征。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3D-SSM及其配套模块显著提升了变化检测的性能和特征表示能力。

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CAN和SPCAN方法在无监督域适应任务中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled
target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on
different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the
object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action
recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Motivation: 现有水道感知模型缺乏全局语义理解能力，限制了大规模监测和结构化日志生成。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）构建WaterCaption数据集，并提出基于Nano Transformer Adaptor（NTA）的Da Yu模型。

Result: WaterCaption包含20.2k图像-文本对，Da Yu在性能与效率上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: WaterCaption和Da Yu为水道环境感知提供了新方向，显著提升了长文本生成能力。

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

TL;DR: HoliGS是一种新颖的可变形高斯溅射框架，用于从长单目RGB视频中实现视图合成，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有4D高斯溅射和动态NeRF方法在长时间捕获场景中训练开销大的问题。

Method: 通过可逆高斯溅射变形网络分解场景为静态背景和时间变化对象，利用分层变形策略实现自由视点渲染。

Result: 在挑战性数据集上实现更高质量的重建，并显著减少训练和渲染时间。

Conclusion: HoliGS为现实场景中的EVS提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

<details>

Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要依赖视觉语言模型的通用理解能力生成动作信号，忽略了视觉观察中的时间和因果结构。

Method: UniVLA将视觉、语言和动作信号建模为离散标记序列，结合世界建模从大规模视频数据中学习，并迁移到下游策略学习。

Result: 在多个仿真基准测试中（如CALVIN、LIBERO）取得新SOTA，LIBERO上平均成功率95.5%，显著优于pi0-FAST的85.5%。

Conclusion: UniVLA展示了在机器人操作和自动驾驶等实际任务中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for
their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches
predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal
and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present
UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models
vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach
sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation
benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly
surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success
rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate
its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous
driving.

Motivation: 现有方法在伪装物体分割中存在域差距和边界模糊问题，导致分割和分类效果不佳。

Method: 提出一种VLM引导的级联框架，利用SAM进行分割，并通过VLM特征作为提示；分类阶段使用alpha通道保留图像上下文，避免硬裁剪带来的域差距。

Result: 在OVCOS和传统伪装物体分割基准测试中，该方法表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过结合VLM的丰富语义信息，该方法在伪装物体的分割和分类中取得了更准确和上下文感知的效果。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

Conclusion: 结合人类注视数据的机器学习方法为气道技能评估提供了客观、高效的解决方案，适用于高压力临床环境。

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

Method: 提出LM-AD方法，结合预训练语言模型，通过AQM模块高效捕捉点云与文本的细粒度对齐。

Result: 在3D AffordanceNet数据集上，LM-AD在准确率和平均IoU上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LM-AD通过引入AQM模块，显著提升了3D点云功能检测的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

Motivation: 解决多模态领域自适应问题，特别是在目标域中某些模态缺失的情况下，如何有效利用源域的多模态数据进行知识迁移。

Method: 提出PMC框架，包含两个新模块：多模态合作选择可靠伪标签目标样本，以及PMC-PI方法，通过多模态数据生成（MMG）网络生成目标域缺失的模态。

Result: 在三个图像数据集和八个视频数据集上的实验验证了PMC框架的有效性。

Conclusion: PMC框架在多模态跨领域视觉识别任务中表现出色，特别是在处理模态缺失问题时。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

Conclusion: RetCoP成功整合多模态数据，为眼底图像分析提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality
scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models
(7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the

rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite

Motivation: 蒸馏视频生成模型在无训练设置下难以实现运动定制，现有方法无法适应其快速生成过程和大去噪步长。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了运动保真度和生成质量，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: MotionEcho为蒸馏视频生成模型提供了一种高效且高质量的运动定制解决方案。

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but
struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially
under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally
designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the
accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models.
To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time
distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging
diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models
to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation
across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across
various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality
while preserving high efficiency. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂条件下稳定建模组织几何和变形，为机械分析提供了额外模态。

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

Motivation: 探索VLMs在训练过程中如何发展图像中文本内容的识别能力，以优化多模态学习策略。

Method: 通过分析VLMs的训练过程，观察文本可读性和语义理解能力的发展模式。

Result: 文本可读性在训练后期突然出现，而语义理解能力则从早期逐渐发展；图像与渲染文本的匹配能力发展更慢。

Conclusion: 研究强调了定制化训练策略的必要性，以加速VLMs的文本理解能力，为未来多模态学习优化提供基础。

Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images
emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis
reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a
given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

Motivation: 传统降尺度方法计算量大，AI扩散模型虽有效但仍计算密集，需改进。

Method: 提出分层扩散降尺度（HDD）模型，采用粗到细的分层采样策略。

Result: 在ERA5和CMIP6数据集上表现优异，计算量减半且结果具有竞争力。

Conclusion: HDD为概率气候降尺度提供了轻量级解决方案，支持大规模高分辨率气候预测。

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

Motivation: 超高分辨率遥感技术的发展对高效语义分割的需求增加，现有方法在计算效率和多尺度特征融合方面存在不足。

Method: 提出GLCANet，采用双流架构融合全局语义和局部细节，结合自注意力和掩码交叉注意力机制优化特征融合。

Result: 实验表明GLCANet在精度和计算效率上优于现有方法，能高效处理大尺寸高分辨率图像。

Conclusion: GLCANet为实际遥感应用提供了高效且轻量级的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

Motivation: 解决现有VLN方法中缺乏统一记忆、固定上下文窗口限制和隐式空间推理的问题。

Method: 提出Mem4Nav系统，结合稀疏八叉树（精细体素索引）和语义拓扑图（高层地标连接），并嵌入可逆Transformer中。长短记忆模块分别处理历史和实时数据。

Conclusion: Mem4Nav通过分层地图和双记忆模块，显著提升了VLN任务的性能，证明了其设计的必要性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

Conclusion: AMF-MedIT为医疗多模态数据融合提供了高效解决方案，FT-Mamba增强了表格数据的处理能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

Conclusion: 解决样本分布不一致问题是构建可信赖的归因分析的关键，抑制特征的采样方法有效且优于现有方法。

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout
all experimental models.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look
(saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater

inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide

Motivation: 糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）影响近半数糖尿病患者，需要早期检测。现有自动化方法存在特征提取效率低、依赖手工先验和数据不足的问题。

Method: HMSViT采用基于池化的分层和双重注意力机制，结合绝对位置编码，实现高效多尺度特征提取。通过块掩码自监督学习框架减少对标记数据的依赖，并使用多尺度解码器进行分割和分类。

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

Conclusion: SceneCrafter为驾驶场景的逼真编辑提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了模拟的实用性和可信度。

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV)
systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在视觉输入与文本输出之间存在不一致（视觉幻觉），这在安全关键AI应用中带来风险，需要有效的评估基准和检测方法。

Method: 开发了PRE-HAL数据集，系统评估LVLMs的感知和推理能力；提出基于Dempster-Shafer理论的视觉幻觉检测方法，通过不确定性估计高效捕捉特征冲突。

Result: 新方法在三种LVLMs（LLaVA-v1.5、mPLUG-Owl2和mPLUG-Owl3）上优于五种基线不确定性指标，AUROC平均提升4%、10%和7%。

Conclusion: PRE-HAL数据集和提出的检测方法有效揭示了LVLMs的视觉漏洞，尤其在关系推理任务中表现突出，为模型可靠性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our

### [89] [ReMAR-DS: Recalibrated Feature Learning for Metal Artifact Reduction and CT Domain Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19531)
*Mubashara Rehman,Niki Martinel,Michele Avanzo,Riccardo Spizzo,Christian Micheloni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReMAR-DS的深度学习框架，用于减少kVCT成像中的金属伪影，并将其转换为MVCT图像，提升放疗规划质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: kVCT成像中的伪影影响图像质量，进而影响临床决策。传统方法无法有效解决高分辨率kVCT与抗伪影MVCT之间的差距。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，结合特征重校准技术，专注于伪影区域和关键解剖结构，生成高质量的MVCT样重建图像。

Result: 通过定性和定量评估验证，该方法能有效减少伪影并保留解剖结构，减少重复MVCT扫描的需求。

Conclusion: ReMAR-DS框架为临床提供了高质量的MVCT样图像，降低了患者的辐射暴露，提升了放疗规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

*Ankita Raj,Ambar Pal,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种检测和识别面部识别系统中自然触发器的后门攻击的新方法，并在实验中取得了优于基线方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击通过隐藏触发器在输入中激活异常行为，对高安全性应用中的面部识别系统构成威胁，因此需要有效检测和识别这些触发器。

Method: 提出了一种新技术，用于检测面部识别网络是否被植入自然、物理可实现的触发器，并在已知被攻击的网络中识别这些触发器。

Result: 在实验中，该方法在识别触发器（如绿色太阳镜或红色帽子）时的前5准确率达到74%，而基线方法仅为56%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和识别面部识别系统中的后门攻击触发器，提升了安全性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨是否应在医学数据上预训练定制基础模型，还是从通用模型迁移学习。通过胎儿超声数据集实验，发现定制预训练效果更佳，且无需复杂方法创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学领域大规模无标签数据下，是否需定制预训练模型及是否需要新方法的问题。

Method: 使用DINOv2方法在200万张胎儿超声图像上预训练基础模型，并与自然图像预训练模型对比。

Result: 定制预训练模型在超声任务中表现优于通用模型，且无需超参数调整或方法创新。

Conclusion: 在资源有限时，应优先定制预训练模型，避免过度追求方法创新。

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

*Minjong Cheon,Changbae Mun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaOutRS是一种新型混合卷积架构，用于遥感图像分类，通过结合门控CNN和傅里叶滤波门模块，在多个数据集上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管状态空间模型（SSMs）在视觉任务中表现出色，但其在2D视觉数据上的适应往往复杂且效率低下。本文旨在探索是否可以通过更简单的架构替代SSMs。

Method: MambaOutRS采用四阶段分层设计，结合门控CNN块进行局部特征提取，并引入傅里叶滤波门（FFG）模块在频域捕获全局上下文信息。

Result: MambaOutRS在UC Merced、AID等数据集上表现优异，其轻量版（24.0M参数）在UC Merced和AID上分别达到98.41%和95.99%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过门控卷积和频域模块的结合，可以高效替代复杂的SSMs，为遥感等领域提供高性能且计算高效的模型范例。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

TL;DR: SMARTIES是一个通用的基础模型，能够处理多传感器遥感数据，通过共享频谱感知空间和跨传感器标记混合，实现传感器无关的特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常针对单一传感器或固定组合，限制了多传感器数据的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出SMARTIES模型，将异构传感器数据投影到共享频谱感知空间，并使用统一的Transformer模型进行跨传感器标记混合训练。

Result: SMARTIES在单模态和多模态任务中均优于依赖传感器特定预训练的模型。

Conclusion: SMARTIES为多传感器遥感数据处理提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and
pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云覆盖导致MSI数据缺失或损坏，影响早期作物制图；SAR数据不受云干扰但缺乏光谱细节，需结合两者优势。

Method: 利用ViT的注意力机制，结合时间序列MSI和SAR数据，重建云覆盖区域的MSI图像。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著优于仅使用非时间序列MSI和SAR或时间序列MSI的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的时间序列ViT框架有效提升了云覆盖区域的MSI图像重建质量。

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Result: 在KITTI-360数据集上，NVSF在LiDAR和相机领域均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: NVSF是一种高效、自监督的多模态动态NeRF框架，适用于自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,
referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the
implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR
and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing
both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs,
our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline
models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera
domain. Code of the model is available at

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning
of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present
VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of
future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet
outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking

Result: HOIverse提供了密集且准确的关系标注，并在最先进的场景图生成模型上进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: HOIverse有望推动涉及人类的场景理解研究。

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field
of scene understanding involving people.

TL;DR: PEVLM是一种并行编码策略，旨在提高视觉语言模型（VLMs）的长视频理解效率，无需微调模型，显著降低计算复杂度并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了视觉语言模型在长视频理解中的应用，需要一种高效的方法来提升性能。

Method: PEVLM通过分块输入、共享sink、保留全注意力位置嵌入和对齐注意力权重来模拟全注意力分布，将计算复杂度从$O((T \times N)^2)$降至$O(T \times N)$。

Result: 在LongVideoBench基准测试中，PEVLM比现有方法精度提升8.37%，注意力计算速度提升7.47倍，端到端延迟降低40%。在严格延迟约束下，精度从23.26%提升至61.03%。

Conclusion: PEVLM在低延迟、长上下文视频理解中表现出色，适用于自动驾驶等实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理大规模地球系统数据集时，其空间、时间和光谱冗余与标准视频类似，可以利用成熟的视频压缩技术。

Method: 通过ffmpeg使用标准视频编解码器将多通道时空数据集编码为视频。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上测试，压缩后PSNR表现优异，数据大小显著减小，且不影响下游深度学习任务性能。

Conclusion: xarrayvideo为地球科学社区提供了一种高效处理大型数据集的方法，使先进压缩技术更易用。

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),
DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis
data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2
images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,
and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,
and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,
DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the
machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at
significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without
compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is
observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their
respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance
prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an
efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation
datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to
the Earth science community. The library is available for use at

TL;DR: SAM2-SGP框架通过支持集引导的提示生成和低秩适应策略，解决了SAM2在医学图像分割中依赖人工提示和领域偏移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2在医学图像分割中面临依赖人工提示和领域偏移的挑战，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出SAM2-SGP框架，包括伪掩码生成模块（PMG）和伪掩码注意力模块（PMA），并采用低秩适应（LoRA）策略。

Result: 在多种医学影像模态上显著优于现有模型（如nnUNet、SwinUNet、SAM2和MedSAM2）。

Conclusion: SAM2-SGP通过自动化提示生成和领域适应，有效提升了医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation
models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 在M3D-Cap数据集上超越基线模型，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了CT报告生成中的特征提取和对齐问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

Motivation: 精准肿瘤学需要准确的分子信息，但直接从基因组学获取成本高且耗时。PathLUPI旨在通过WSI预测分子特征和患者预后，解决当前深度学习方法的主要挑战。

Method: PathLUPI在训练中使用转录组特权信息，提取基因组锚定的组织学嵌入，仅需WSI即可进行推理。

Result: 在49项分子肿瘤学任务中，PathLUPI表现优于传统方法，14项任务AUC≥0.80，5种主要癌症类型的生存队列C-index≥0.70。

Conclusion: PathLUPI通过编码分子上下文优化WSI表示，克服现有模型限制，为临床病理工作流程提供新策略。

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

TL;DR: UltraAD是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的方法，利用少量超声图像样本进行异常定位和细粒度分类，解决了现有方法在设备差异和细粒度区分上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中的精确异常检测对临床决策至关重要，但现有方法在细粒度区分（如良性与恶性肿瘤）和设备差异导致的域差距上表现不足。

Method: 通过融合图像级令牌与可学习文本嵌入，增强定位性能；构建记忆库存储少量样本及其文本描述，用于细粒度分类。

Result: 在三个乳腺超声数据集上，UltraAD在异常定位和细粒度分类上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UltraAD通过结合视觉语言模型和少量样本，显著提升了医学图像异常检测的精度和适用性。

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: CoCo4D提出了一种从文本提示生成动态4D场景的框架，通过分离动态前景和背景建模，结合参考运动序列，实现多视角一致性和沉浸感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D合成方法主要关注对象级生成或有限新视角的动态场景合成，无法生成多视角一致且沉浸的动态4D场景。

Method: CoCo4D将4D场景合成分为动态前景和背景建模，利用视频扩散模型生成初始运动序列，并通过渐进外推方案合成动态场景。

Result: 实验表明，CoCo4D在4D场景生成中性能优于或与现有方法相当，实现了真实且连贯的动态场景合成。

Conclusion: CoCo4D通过分离前景和背景建模，结合运动序列指导，有效生成了多视角一致且沉浸的动态4D场景。

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型网络依赖多个原型协作决策，解释复杂度高，ProtoSolo旨在通过单原型激活简化分类和解释过程。

Method: 提出基于特征图的相似性比较方法，利用全局信息进行分类；引入非原型投影学习策略，避免结构突变对性能的影响。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和Stanford Cars数据集上，ProtoSolo在分类任务和解释复杂度方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ProtoSolo通过单原型激活和特征图比较方法，实现了高效分类和低解释复杂度，优于现有可解释方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法在双角色对话视频生成任务上表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Bind-Your-Avatar为多角色对话视频生成提供了有效解决方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head
generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters
video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance
over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户对高分辨率视频需求的增加，仅依赖潜在计算已不足，需探索更高效的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：语义内容生成和细节合成，后者通过视频超分辨率模型实现。提出了退化策略、时间步采样策略和噪声增强等设计原则。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有技术，并通过消融研究验证了各设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为级联视频超分辨率生成提供了简单有效的基线，为未来高效合成系统的发展提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维视觉模态生成的计算密集型问题，同时避免复杂多阶段架构带来的额外负担。

Method: 提出Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM)，在多尺度表示（如拉普拉斯金字塔）的每一层独立应用Flow Matching。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k 512px上，FDD分数提升35.2%，优于基线方法；在大型模型（如FLUX）微调中收敛更快。

Conclusion: DFM通过单一模型和简单架构实现了显著的性能提升，且对现有训练流程改动最小。

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

Motivation: 现有的大规模预训练视频扩散模型在生成长视频时存在不真实的人类-场景交互、缺乏主体身份保持以及训练成本高的问题。

Method: GenHSI将长视频生成任务分为三个阶段：脚本编写、预可视化和动画。通过3D关键帧和现成的视频扩散模型实现一致的长视频生成。

Result: 实验表明，GenHSI能够从单张场景图像生成保持场景内容和角色身份的长视频，并实现合理的人类-场景交互。

Conclusion: GenHSI首次实现了无需训练即可生成长视频序列，具有一致的相机姿态和任意数量的角色动作。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法（如FisheRF和ActiveNeRF）在3D空间中选择最佳视图时需针对不同3D表示进行专门设计，且建模复杂。本文将其重新定义为2D IQA任务，以简化流程并提高效率。

Method: 通过训练一个模型预测多视图设置中的SSIM，并利用其指导视图选择，避免了传统方法对3D表示的依赖。

Result: 该方法在标准基准测试中实现了显著的定量和定性改进，运行速度比现有方法快14-33倍。

Conclusion: 提出的跨参考IQA框架简化了视图选择流程，提高了效率，且适用于多种3D表示。

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM)
and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention
mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention,

Conclusion: ScaleCap通过逐步优化描述生成，显著提升了图像描述的质量和多样性，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

Conclusion: AnimaX为类别无关的3D动画提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了运动生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution
for category-agnostic 3D animation. Project page:

Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本高，尤其是长视频生成时，时空能量衰减现象启发了一种更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 提出Radial Attention，一种稀疏注意力机制，通过静态注意力掩码和指数衰减计算密度降低复杂度。

Result: 在多个数据集上保持视频质量，计算效率提升1.9倍，训练成本降低4.4倍，推理加速3.7倍。

Conclusion: Radial Attention显著提升了视频扩散模型的效率和扩展性，适用于长视频生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

Motivation: 研究G-SYNC技术在60Hz帧率下的效果，补充此前30Hz的研究。

Method: 在60Hz帧率下测试G-SYNC对玩家表现和情感的影响。

Result: G-SYNC在60Hz下对资深玩家表现有提升，但对情感和体验影响较小。

Conclusion: G-SYNC在60Hz下仍有价值，尤其对挑战性游戏中的资深玩家。

Abstract: G-SYNC technology matches formerly regular display refreshes to irregular
frame updates, improving frame rates and interactive latency. In a previous
study of gaming at the 30Hz frame rates common on consoles, players of
Battlefield 4 were unable to discern when G-SYNC was in use, but scored higher
with G-SYNC and were affected emotionally. We build on that study with the
first examination of G-SYNC's effects at the 60Hz frame rate more common in PC
gaming and on emerging consoles. Though G-SYNC's effects are less at 60Hz than
they were at 30Hz, G-SYNC can still improve the performance of veteran players,
particularly when games are challenging. G-SYNC's effects on emotion and
experience were limited.

accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments -
remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth
estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and
limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted
Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D
Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work
by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian
depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we
incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and
introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In
addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to
our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude.
As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher
reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a
factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient
Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.

Abstract: The revolutionary advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) has fundamentally transformed the landscape of visual content creation
and artistic expression. While remarkable progress has been made in image
generation and style transfer, the underlying mechanisms and aesthetic
implications of these technologies remain insufficiently understood. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of AIGC technologies in visual arts, tracing
their evolution from early algorithmic frameworks to contemporary deep
generative models. We identify three pivotal paradigms: Variational
Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion
Models, and examine their roles in bridging the gap between human creativity
and machine synthesis. To support our analysis, we systematically review over
500 research papers published in the past decade, spanning both foundational
developments and state-of-the-art innovations. Furthermore, we propose a
multidimensional evaluation framework that incorporates Technical Innovation,
Artistic Merit, Visual Quality, Computational Efficiency, and Creative
Potential. Our findings reveal both the transformative capacities and current
limitations of AIGC systems, emphasizing their profound impact on the future of
creative practices. Through this extensive synthesis, we offer a unified
perspective on the convergence of artificial intelligence and artistic
expression, while outlining key challenges and promising directions for future
research in this rapidly evolving field.

Conclusion: 该方法为多变量体积数据的可视化提供了一种通用且有效的解决方案，支持交互式分析和探索。

Abstract: We introduce continuous indexed points for improved multivariate volume
visualization. Indexed points represent linear structures in parallel
coordinates and can be used to encode local correlation of multivariate
(including multifield, multifaceted, and multiattribute) volume data. First, we
perform local linear fitting in the spatial neighborhood of each volume sample
using principal component analysis, accelerated by hierarchical spatial data
structures. This local linear information is then visualized as continuous
indexed points in parallel coordinates: a density representation of indexed
points in a continuous domain. With our new method, multivariate volume data
can be analyzed using the eigenvector information from local spatial
embeddings. We utilize both 1-flat and 2-flat indexed points, allowing us to
identify correlations between two variables and even three variables,
respectively. An interactive occlusion shading model facilitates good spatial
perception of the volume rendering of volumetric correlation characteristics.
Interactive exploration is supported by specifically designed multivariate
transfer function widgets working in the image plane of parallel coordinates.
We show that our generic technique works for multi-attribute datasets. The
effectiveness and usefulness of our new method is demonstrated through a case
study, an expert user study, and domain expert feedback.

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模3D高斯泼溅场景的高效渲染提供了实用解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting represents a breakthrough in the field of novel view
synthesis. It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly
accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have
drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we
present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes
using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual
texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and
dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering.
Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results
in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for
highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be
integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for
large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key
practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its
impact on desktop and mobile devices.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统方法，利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）识别生成图像模型中的“概念盲点”，即训练数据中存在但生成图像中缺失或错误表现的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成图像模型在大规模数据集上表现优异，但在生成某些简单概念（如人手或四件物品）时仍会失败。这些失败模式是否反映模型的结构性限制尚不明确。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）提取可解释的概念嵌入，定量比较真实图像与生成图像中概念的普遍性。训练了一个包含32,000个概念的RA-SAE模型。

Result: 应用于四种流行生成模型（Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, Kandinsky），发现了特定的抑制盲点（如鸟食器、DVD光盘）和夸张盲点（如木质背景纹理）。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个理论框架，通过评估生成模型与数据生成过程的概念保真度，系统识别其概念盲点。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on
large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple
concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that
are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes
have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether
they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these
models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and
characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data
but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,
enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and
generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with
32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained
analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models
(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals
specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces
on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and
palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization
artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates
seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework
for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by
assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying
data-generating process.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了未知环境中在线动态机制设计问题，提出了一种基于强化学习的动态VCG机制，适用于连续拍卖场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多基于多臂老虎机或阶段性MDP模型，忽略了市场的连续演化特性。本文旨在解决这一局限性，提出更贴近现实的模型。

Method: 将VCG机制扩展到连续拍卖中，开发了一种在线强化学习算法，用于学习未知MDP模型并实现动态机制。

Result: 学习到的在线机制渐近收敛于近似满足效率、真实性和个体理性的动态机制，并在多种遗憾度量下表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文提出的动态VCG机制和在线学习方法为连续拍卖环境提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential
auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the
bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the
bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon
average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and
reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller
determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a
private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which
represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition
kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate
the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the
environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper
considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market
continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,
truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential
auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves
these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an
online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying
MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG
mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges
to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,
and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves
guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于区间估计的随机决策框架MERIT，旨在优化不确定环境下的选择过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统确定性选择规则在评估误差和未来不确定性的情况下不可靠，现有随机方法缺乏理论支持。

Method: 提出MERIT方法，通过最大化最坏情况下预期选择的顶级候选人数，基于区间估计进行优化。

Result: MERIT在多项式时间内可解，适用于大规模数据（超过10,000项），并在实验中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MERIT提供了一种理论支持且高效的随机决策方法，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Many decision-making processes involve evaluating and then selecting items;
examples include scientific peer review, job hiring, school admissions, and
investment decisions. The eventual selection is performed by applying rules or
deliberations to the raw evaluations, and then deterministically selecting the
items deemed to be the best. These domains feature error-prone evaluations and
uncertainty about future outcomes, which undermine the reliability of such
deterministic selection rules. As a result, selection mechanisms involving
explicit randomization that incorporate the uncertainty are gaining traction in
practice. However, current randomization approaches are ad hoc, and as we
prove, inappropriate for their purported objectives. In this paper, we propose
a principled framework for randomized decision-making based on interval
estimates of the quality of each item. We introduce MERIT (Maximin Efficient
Randomized Interval Top-k), an optimization-based method that maximizes the
worst-case expected number of top candidates selected, under uncertainty
represented by overlapping intervals (e.g., confidence intervals or min-max
intervals). MERIT provides an optimal resource allocation scheme under an
interpretable notion of robustness. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to
solve the optimization problem and demonstrate empirically that the method
scales to over 10,000 items. We prove that MERIT satisfies desirable axiomatic
properties not guaranteed by existing approaches. Finally, we empirically
compare algorithms on synthetic peer review data. Our experiments demonstrate
that MERIT matches the performance of existing algorithms in expected utility
under fully probabilistic review data models used in previous work, while
outperforming previous methods with respect to our novel worst-case
formulation.

Motivation: 在现实世界中，如医疗住院匹配、学校选择等场景，候选人需要决定申请哪些项目，而面试和信息收集阶段会影响双方的偏好。研究目标是确定候选人应寻求哪些面试。

Method: 基于Lee（2016）和Allman与Ashlagi（2023）的模型，采用分布式低通信策略，分析了医生和学生在不同场景下的匹配率和效用。

Result: 在住院匹配和学校选择场景中，非底层代理的匹配率分别为$e^{(-\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k}))}$和$e^{(-\widetilde{O}(k))}$，且容量较大的项目对医院和学校更有利。

Conclusion: 研究提供了候选人在匹配算法中的策略指导，并展示了不同参数对结果的影响，同时通过实验验证了理论结果的实用性。

Abstract: In real-world settings of the Deferred Acceptance stable matching algorithm,
such as the American medical residency match (NRMP), school choice programs,
and various national university entrance systems, candidates need to decide
which programs to list. In many of these settings there is an initial phase of
interviews or information gathering which affect the preferences on one or both
sides. We ask: which interviews should candidates seek? We study this question
in a model, introduced by Lee (2016) and modified by Allman and Ashlagi (2023),
with preferences based on correlated cardinal utilities.
  We describe a distributed, low-communication strategy for the doctors and
students, which lead to non-match rates of $e^{(-\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k}))}$ in
the residency setting and $e^{(-\widetilde{O}(k))}$ in the school-choice
setting, where $k$ is the number of interviews per doctor in the first setting,
and the number of proposals per student in the second setting; these bounds do
not apply to the agents with the lowest public ratings, the bottommost agents,
who may not fare as well. We also obtain bounds on the expected utilities each
non-bottommost agent obtains.
  These results are parameterized by the capacity of the hospital programs and
schools. Larger capacities improve the outcome for the hospitals and schools,
but don't significantly affect the outcomes of the doctors or students.
Finally, in the school choice setting we obtain an $\epsilon$-Nash type
equilibrium for the students apart from the bottommost ones; importantly, the
equilibrium holds regardless of the actions of the bottommost students. We also
discuss to what extent this result extends to the residency setting. We
complement our theoretical results with an experimental study that shows the
asymptotic results hold for real-world values of $n$.

Motivation: 解决现有EEG基础模型在泛化性和任务特定调优方面的不足。

Method: 设计了Neuro-Language Connector和Task-aware Query Selection模块，将EEG信号转化为语言模型可理解的表示，并动态生成任务自适应查询。

Result: 在十个数据集上平均性能提升12%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: UniMind不仅提升了多任务解码性能，还提供了跨任务神经功能相关性的新见解。

Abstract: Decoding human brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a
central challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial
intelligence, enabling diverse applications in mental state assessment,
clinical monitoring, and human-machine interaction. Recent efforts have
extensively explored EEG-based brain foundation models for generalized brain
decoding, employing large-scale training on multiple datasets. However, most of
these attempts struggle with generalizability and fail to achieve satisfactory
performance without task-specific tuning due to pronounced inherent
heterogeneity among decoding tasks. To address these challenges, we present
UniMind, a general-purpose EEG foundation model for unified multi-task brain
decoding by uniquely unleashing the power of large language models to
comprehend complex neural patterns. UniMind offers several advantages. First,
we design a Neuro-Language Connector to bridge the modality gap between neural
signals and large language models, distilling and transforming the
spatiotemporal neural patterns of EEG data into representations understandable
by language models. Second, a Task-aware Query Selection module is proposed to
inject task-awareness into the cross-modal alignment by dynamically generating
task-adaptive query tokens, enabling learning of task-relevant neural patterns
across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate
that UniMind substantially outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task decoding
models, with an average gain of 12 percent, while also offering valuable
neuroscientific insights into neural functional correlations across tasks. The
code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) applications since 2022,
their use in education has sparked both excitement and concern. Recent studies
consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes.
This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve
their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a
theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from
LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention
in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education
(CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with
instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to
inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their
insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an
interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical
prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through
a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed
methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners'
LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward
the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future.
Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting;
(2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical
prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning
tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching
LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in
classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an
on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI.

understanding and interaction with the immediate environment. Guided by the
Double Diamond design framework, we conducted a two-week diary study, two

Vision Pro. Our findings demonstrate that smart glasses can meaningfully
address key challenges in locating objects, reading text, recognising people,
engaging in conversations, and managing sensory stress. With the rapid
advancement of smart glasses and increasing recognition of CVI as a distinct
form of vision impairment, this research addresses a timely and under-explored

comprises over 480,000 user reviews labeled into seven categories that capture
critical aspects of trust in applications, trust in providers and privacy
concerns. Creating HARPT required addressing multiple complexities, such as
defining a nuanced label schema, isolating relevant content from large volumes
of noisy data, and designing an annotation strategy that balanced scalability
with accuracy. This strategy integrated rule-based filtering, iterative manual
labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using
transformer-based classifiers to accelerate coverage. In parallel, a carefully
curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support model
development and evaluation. We benchmark a broad range of classification
models, demonstrating that strong performance is achievable and providing a
baseline for future research. HARPT is released as a public resource to support

Result: 定量结果显示不同年龄模式（40s、50s、60s）下的近点变化显著；定性结果表明参与者理解和同理心提升。

Conclusion: OpticalAging可作为年龄包容性设计工作流程的补充工具，但需与直接用户参与结合使用。

Abstract: Presbyopia, a common age-related vision condition affecting most people as
they age, often remains inadequately understood by those unaffected. To help
bridge the gap between abstract accessibility knowledge and a more grounded
appreciation of perceptual challenges, this study presents OpticalAging, an
optical see-through simulation approach. Unlike VR-based methods, OpticalAging
uses dynamically controlled tunable lenses to simulate the first-person visual
perspective of presbyopia's distance-dependent blur during real-world
interaction, aiming to enhance awareness. While acknowledging critiques
regarding simulation's limitations in fully capturing lived experience, we
position this tool as a complement to user-centered methods. Our user study (N
= 19, 18-35 years old) provides validation: quantitative measurements show
statistically significant changes in near points across three age modes (40s,
50s, 60s), while qualitative results suggest increases in reported
understanding and empathy among participants. The integration of our tool into
a design task showcases its potential applicability within age-inclusive design
workflows when used critically alongside direct user engagement.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了理论驱动的学习分析仪表盘（LAD）是否能通过提升写作知识、培养自我调节学习（SRL）技能和优化人机对话特性，改善高等教育中生成式AI（GenAI）与学生的协作写作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在教育中的广泛应用引发了对学生过度依赖和浅层学习的担忧，尤其是在写作任务中。研究旨在探索如何通过LAD增强人机协作，避免技术对学习过程的负面影响。

Method: 基于Zimmerman的SRL框架，LAD提供实时反馈，监控学习者目标设定、写作过程和反思。研究采用准实验设计，52名研究生分为实验组（使用LAD）和对照组（不使用LAD），通过知识测试、SRL问卷、认知负荷问卷及对话数据分析效果。

Result: 实验组在写作知识和SRL技能（如自我效能和认知策略）上显著提升，但也报告了更高的测试焦虑和认知负荷。对话分析显示实验组与GenAI的互动更具反思性和评估性，而对照组更倾向于事务性和信息寻求。

Conclusion: 研究强调了设计互补GenAI工具干预措施的重要性，以确保技术增强而非削弱学习过程，为GenAI在教育中的应用提供了实践指导。

Abstract: The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into education has raised concerns
about over-reliance and superficial learning, particularly in writing tasks in

Grounded in Zimmerman's SRL framework, the LAD provided real-time feedback on
learners' goal-setting, writing processes and reflection, while monitoring the
quality of learner-AI interactions. A quasi-experiment was conducted involving
52 postgraduate students divided into an experimental group (EG) using the LAD
to a control group (CG) without it in a human-AI collaborative writing task.
Pre- and post- knowledge tests, questionnaires measuring SRL and cognitive
load, and students' dialogue data with GenAI were collected and analyzed.
Results showed that the EG achieved significantly higher writing knowledge
gains and improved SRL skills, particularly in self-efficacy and cognitive
strategies. However, the EG also reported increased test anxiety and cognitive
load, possibly due to heightened metacognitive awareness. Epistemic Network
Analysis revealed that the EG engaged in more reflective, evaluative
interactions with GenAI, while the CG focused on more transactional and
information-seeking exchanges. These findings contribute to the growing body of
literature on the educational use of GenAI and highlight the importance of
designing interventions that complement GenAI tools, ensuring that technology
enhances rather than undermines the learning process.

Motivation: 通过低成本、无需额外设备的深度摄像头和AI技术，提升交互系统和用户研究的自动化分析能力。

Method: 结合现有AI识别模型，构建远程协作系统，并讨论AI组件的协调与跟踪管道的工程化问题。

Result: 展示了基于现有技术构建的远程协作系统的可行性和潜力。

Conclusion: 深度摄像头与AI组件的结合为行为分析提供了新机遇，但需解决技术协调与工程化挑战。

Abstract: The automated analysis of human behaviour provides many opportunities for the
creation of interactive systems and the post-experiment investigations for user
studies. Commodity depth cameras offer reasonable body tracking accuracy at a
low price point, without the need for users to wear or hold any extra
equipment. The resulting systems typically perform body tracking through a
dedicated machine learning model, but they can be enhanced with additional AI
components providing extra capabilities. This leads to opportunities but also
challenges, for example regarding the orchestration of such AI components and
the engineering of the resulting tracking pipeline. In this paper, we discuss
these elements, based on our experience with the creation of a remote
collaboration system across distant wall-sized displays, that we built using
existing and readily available building blocks, including AI-based recognition
models.

Motivation: 共情是职场合作与沟通的关键，但培养共情能力仍具挑战。

Method: 采用混合方法，通过共情商数（EQ）量化评估，并结合扎根理论分析参与者体验。

Result: 定量分析未显示共情倾向显著变化，但定性结果表明工具促进了情境共情、自我反思和职场关系。

Conclusion: 异步、结构化的数字叙事工具有望支持职场共情，为情感智能技术设计提供启示。

Abstract: Empathy is widely recognized as a vital attribute for effective collaboration
and communication in the workplace, yet developing empathic skills and
fostering it among colleagues remains a challenge. This study explores the
potential of a collaborative digital storytelling platform - In Your Shoes -
designed to promote empathic listening and interpersonal understanding through
the structured exchange of personal narratives. A one-week intervention was
conducted with employees from multiple organizations using the platform.
Employing a mixed methods approach, we assessed quantitative changes in empathy
using the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and qualitatively analyzed participant
experiences through grounded theory. While quantitative analysis revealed no
statistically significant shift in dispositional empathy, qualitative findings
suggested the tool facilitated situational empathy, prompted self-reflection,
improved emotional resonance, and enhanced workplace relationships.
Participants reported feelings of psychological safety, connection, and, in
some cases, therapeutic benefits from sharing and responding to stories. These
results highlight the promise of asynchronous, structured narrative-based
digital tools for supporting empathic engagement in professional settings,
offering insights for the design of emotionally intelligent workplace
technologies.

TL;DR: VR神经心理学测试中，眼动追踪和头凝视输入方式在速度和准确性上优于手动控制器，年龄是主要影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究虚拟现实（VR）输入模式在神经心理学测试中的适用性，特别是眼动追踪、头凝视和手动控制器的表现差异。

Method: 77名健康志愿者（年轻和中年）完成VR Trail-Making测试，记录完成时间、空间准确性和错误次数，并进行主观评分。

Result: 眼动追踪在空间准确性上最佳，头凝视在速度和错误率上表现优异，手动控制器表现最差。年轻参与者表现优于中年。

Conclusion: 基于凝视的输入方式优于手动控制，但最佳选择取决于任务需求。VR测试需根据年龄制定标准。

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) can enrich neuropsychological testing, yet the ergonomic
trade-offs of its input modes remain under-examined. Seventy-seven healthy
volunteers-young (19-29 y) and middle-aged (27-56 y)-completed a VR
Trail-Making Test with three pointing methods: eye-tracking, head-gaze, and a
six-degree-of-freedom hand controller. Completion time, spatial accuracy, and
error counts for the simple (Trail A) and alternating (Trail B) sequences were
analysed in 3 x 2 x 2 mixed-model ANOVAs; post-trial scales captured usability
(SUS), user experience (UEQ-S), and acceptability. Age dominated behaviour:
younger adults were reliably faster, more precise, and less error-prone.
Against this backdrop, input modality mattered. Eye-tracking yielded the best
spatial accuracy and shortened Trail A time relative to manual control;
head-gaze matched eye-tracking on Trail A speed and became the quickest, least
error-prone option on Trail B. Controllers lagged on every metric. Subjective
ratings were high across the board, with only a small usability dip in
middle-aged low-gamers. Overall, gaze-based ray-casting clearly outperformed
manual pointing, but optimal choice depended on task demands: eye-tracking
maximised spatial precision, whereas head-gaze offered calibration-free
enhanced speed and error-avoidance under heavier cognitive load. TMT-VR appears
to be accurate, engaging, and ergonomically adaptable assessment, yet it
requires age-specific-stratified norms.

Method: 通过两阶段共同设计研究，包括26名HCPs参与的想法生成、概念评估、原型测试和设计迭代。

Result: HCPs高度认可沉浸式、具身化和集体体验技术对心理健康的支持潜力，并提出了满足自主性、能力和关联性需求的设计建议。

Conclusion: 研究为针对HCPs的健康技术设计提供了实用建议，强调了用户体验的沉浸感和社交互动的重要性。

Abstract: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) face increasing levels of stress and burnout.
Technological wellbeing interventions provide accessible and flexible support
for HCPs. While most studies have focused on mobile- and web-based programs,
alternative technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR),
tangible interfaces, and embodied technologies are emerging as engaging and
effective tools for wellbeing interventions. However, there is still a lack of
research on how such technologies are perceived among HCPs. This study explored
HCPs' perceptions and preferences for various types of wellbeing technologies,
by conducting a 2-phase co-design study involving 26 HCPs in idea generation,
concept evaluation, prototype testing, and design iteration. From our findings,
HCPs highly valued the potential of technologies to support mental health with
immersive, embodied, and collective experiences. Furthermore, we provided
design recommendations for wellbeing technologies for HCPs that sustain user
engagement by meeting their needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in
the experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像生成的多样性对公平表示和创意构思至关重要，但现有方法难以满足用户个性化的多样性需求。

Method: Varif.ai 通过迭代生成、验证属性覆盖和调整属性，结合用户需求实现多样性控制。

Result: 用户研究表明，Varif.ai 在多样性和用户满意度上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Varif.ai 支持用户控制的多样性，适用于创意构思和可扩展的图像生成。

Abstract: Diversity in image generation is essential to ensure fair representations and
support creativity in ideation. Hence, many text-to-image models have
implemented diversification mechanisms. Yet, after a few iterations of
generation, a lack of diversity becomes apparent, because each user has their
own diversity goals (e.g., different colors, brands of cars), and there are
diverse attributions to be specified. To support user-driven diversity control,
we propose Varif.ai that employs text-to-image and Large Language Models to
iteratively i) (re)generate a set of images, ii) verify if user-specified
attributes have sufficient coverage, and iii) vary existing or new attributes.
Through an elicitation study, we uncovered user needs for diversity in image
generation. A pilot validation showed that Varif.ai made achieving diverse
image sets easier. In a controlled evaluation with 20 participants, Varif.ai
proved more effective than baseline methods across various scenarios. Thus,
this supports user control of diversity in image generation for creative
ideation and scalable image generation.

TL;DR: HI-SQL提出了一种基于历史查询日志的提示生成机制，用于改进复杂查询的Text-to-SQL生成，显著提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL方法在处理多表连接和嵌套条件等复杂查询时存在高计算成本、延迟和错误传播问题。

Method: HI-SQL通过分析历史查询日志生成上下文提示，指导SQL生成，避免多步流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了LLM生成查询的准确性，同时减少了LLM调用和延迟。

Conclusion: HI-SQL为增强Text-to-SQL系统提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: The rapid growth of edge devices has driven the demand for deploying
artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge, giving rise to Tiny Machine Learning

survey presents a comprehensive overview of the transition from TinyML to
TinyDL, encompassing architectural innovations, hardware platforms, model
optimization techniques, and software toolchains. We analyze state-of-the-art
methods in quantization, pruning, and neural architecture search (NAS), and
examine hardware trends from MCUs to dedicated neural accelerators.
Furthermore, we categorize software deployment frameworks, compilers, and
AutoML tools enabling practical on-device learning. Applications across domains
such as computer vision, audio recognition, healthcare, and industrial
monitoring are reviewed to illustrate the real-world impact of TinyDL. Finally,
we identify emerging directions including neuromorphic computing, federated
TinyDL, edge-native foundation models, and domain-specific co-design
approaches. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for
researchers and practitioners, offering a holistic view of the ecosystem and
laying the groundwork for future advancements in edge AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SPLoRA的新方法，通过选择性修剪LoRA层来增强大语言模型的安全性，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大语言模型（LLMs）时，低秩适应（LoRA）虽能降低成本，但可能削弱安全性，现有方法难以平衡安全性与实用性。

Method: 提出SPLoRA，结合修剪技术和E-DIEM相似性度量，选择性移除削弱安全性的LoRA层。

Result: 实验表明，SPLoRA在安全性和性能上优于现有方法，同时降低推理开销。

Conclusion: SPLoRA是一种高效、可扩展的方案，能显著提升LLMs的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is
available at https://github.com/AoShuang92/SPLoRA.

Result: 成功应用于2D高斯混合分布采样，并在10x10振荡器网络中实现了MNIST数据集中0和1的采样。

Conclusion: 该方法为SGMs的非平衡驱动协议学习提供了一种高效且直接的途径。

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based
generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient
with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly
from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration,
we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators
coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a
mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10
oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

TL;DR: Chain-of-Experts (CoE) 是一种新的 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) 架构，通过层内专家顺序通信提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 MoE 模型中专家并行独立工作，缺乏动态交互，限制了模型的表达能力。

Method: CoE 在每层内通过迭代方式处理 token，动态选择专家，并引入路由机制支持每次迭代的专家选择。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，CoE 将验证损失从 1.20 降至 1.12，同时通过迭代深度扩展减少内存使用 17.6-42%。

Conclusion: CoE 通过迭代残差结构和动态路由机制，提升了模型的表达能力和计算效率。

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FIM的新框架，通过聚焦任务关键元素（CoG状态维度）来增强多智能体强化学习中的合作，显著提升了稀疏奖励环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏奖励下的多智能体强化学习（MARL）面临探索不足和协调注意力不集中的挑战。

Method: FIM框架包含三个核心组件：识别CoG状态维度、设计反事实内在奖励、基于资格迹的信用积累。

Result: 在多种MARL基准测试中，FIM显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FIM通过聚焦关键状态维度，有效提升了稀疏奖励环境下的多智能体合作性能。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards
presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient
coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing
Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by
directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center
of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory.
FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 该研究为注塑过程的智能质量控制提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

Motivation: 在边缘设备上运行LLM面临高计算和内存需求的问题，现有方法如量化和剪枝在速度和准确性上存在折衷。

Method: HOLA结合了分层推测解码（HSD）、自适应检索增强生成（AdaComp-RAG）以及LoBi（结合结构化剪枝和量化）技术。

Result: 在GSM8K上提升17.6% EMA，ARC上提升10.5% MCA，同时降低延迟和内存占用。

Conclusion: HOLA证明了其在边缘设备上的可扩展性和生产就绪性。

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high
compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in
sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions
such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer
only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We
introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM
deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD)
for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts
retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends
structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains:
17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge
devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 桥梁作为关键基础设施，其退化问题日益严重，需要可靠的交通监测方法评估剩余寿命。传统方法存在隐私和光照限制，非视觉方法缺乏灵活性。

Method: 结合CV辅助的高分辨率数据集生成与监督学习，利用GNN捕捉传感器数据的空间结构和相互依赖，将CV知识迁移到SHM传感器。

Result: 在实际案例中，模型对轻型车辆和重型车辆的分类准确率分别达到99%和94%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自动化监测和知识迁移，实现了与视觉系统相当的精度，为桥梁健康监测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light
vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

Motivation: 动态图中保持时间连续性至关重要，但大批次训练的MDGNNs会破坏事件序列，导致时间信息丢失，影响模型优化。

Method: 提出BADGNN框架，包含Temporal Lipschitz Regularization（TLR）控制参数搜索空间扩展，以及Adaptive Attention Adjustment（A3）缓解注意力失真。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，BADGNN在保持性能的同时支持更大的批次和更快的训练速度。

Conclusion: BADGNN有效解决了大批次训练中的时间信息丢失问题，提升了动态图神经网络的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

Motivation: 动态预测任务中，传统可解释性方法难以处理时间变化的目标依赖性和时间平滑性，影响模型在重症监护等关键领域的应用。

Method: 系统分析了传统方法的局限性，并提出可学习掩码框架，结合时间连续性和标签一致性约束，学习特征随时间的重要性。

Result: 可学习掩码方法在动态时间序列预测中提供更可靠和一致的解释。

Conclusion: 可学习掩码框架是解决动态预测任务中可解释性问题的有效替代方案，适用于重症监护等领域。

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM增强的合成数据生成方法，专注于提升健康数据中的因果公平性，显著减少敏感属性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在健康领域未解决因果公平性问题，需要一种新方法来生成高质量且公平的合成数据。

Method: 开发了首个LLM增强的合成数据生成方法，利用真实健康数据提升因果公平性。

Result: 合成数据在因果公平性指标上偏离真实数据不到10%，训练后的预测器减少敏感属性偏差70%。

Conclusion: 该方法为健康研究和医疗提供了更公平的合成数据支持。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

Abstract: Recent advancements have brought generated music closer to human-created

preference is the gold standard for assessing quality, translating these
subjective judgments into objective metrics, particularly for text-audio

songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conduct a survey of 15k pairwise
audio comparisons with 2.5k human participants to evaluate the correlation
between human preferences and widely used metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first to rank current state-of-the-art music
generation models and metrics based on human preference. To further the field
of subjective metric evaluation, we provide open access to our dataset of
generated music and human evaluations.

Result: 解码器方法节省50%训练时间和35%内存，且准确性高，表明Aurora的潜在空间捕捉了物理关系。

Conclusion: 基础模型在无需全微调下扩展到新变量的能力是其重要质量指标，有助于资源有限的社区更广泛采用。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

Motivation: 研究神经网络在数学上的表达能力，明确其能够表示的函数类型，并通过构造性方法展示神经网络作为算法的能力。

Method: 采用构造性方法，将神经网络视为算法，而非通过数据训练。例如，构造了一个精确排序输入的神经网络，并分析其计算复杂度。

Result: 构造的神经网络能够精确执行任务（如排序），并具有较高的计算效率。研究发现，这些网络通常是递归和并行的，且深度网络优于浅层网络。

Conclusion: 神经网络作为算法具有强大的表达能力，但其连续性和网络深度限制了其递归能力。深度网络在性能上优于浅层网络。

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

Result: 实验验证了Transformer与Lloyd算法的精确对应，并生成了多种聚类算法变体。

Conclusion: Transformer机制可以精确映射到算法过程，为精确算法的实现提供了清晰视角。

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Riemannian表示学习依赖流形上的密度近似，优化目标复杂且可能损害模型性能。

Method: 引入Riemannian生成解码器，利用Riemannian优化器找到流形值的最大似然潜在变量，同时训练解码器网络。

Result: 在三个案例中验证了方法有效性，学习到的表示尊重预设几何结构并捕获非欧几里得内在结构。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需解码器，兼容现有架构，生成与数据几何对齐的可解释潜在空间。

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如全微调或蒸馏）需要重复且昂贵的步骤，Command-V旨在提供一种高效且无需原始训练数据的替代方案。

Conclusion: Command-V为LLM行为调整提供了一种高效、低成本的方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically
requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for
every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a
backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual
activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and
data are accessible at https://github.com/GithuBarry/Command-V/.

Method: 提出三种互补的归因方法：黑盒法（反事实重要性）、白盒法（注意力模式聚合）和因果归因法（逻辑连接测量）。

Result: 发现"思维锚点"（如规划或回溯句子）对推理过程有显著影响，并通过开源工具可视化分析结果。

Conclusion: 句子级分析为理解推理模型提供了新视角，多种方法的一致性验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习（FL）在微调大语言模型时面临的性能和通信效率问题。

Result: 在保持性能的同时显著降低通信开销，与集中式训练效果相当。

Conclusion: GradualDiff-Fed是一种高效且隐私保护的分布式大模型微调解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要精确计算或多步代数推理的数学问题上表现不佳，而工具集成推理虽然能确保正确性，但引入了推理时的依赖问题。

Method: 构建一个Solver Agent，通过规划、符号工具调用和反思推理解决问题，并通过多LLM代理的反向翻译管道将工具调用痕迹转换为自然语言推理痕迹。

Result: 实验表明，通过微调小型开源模型，可以内化工具知识和结构化推理模式，在竞赛级数学基准上取得提升。

Conclusion: 该方法无需推理时访问工具，即可提升LLMs的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

Motivation: 解决在联邦学习中如何私有地恢复共享嵌入和本地低维表示的问题，同时在小超额风险下适应统计异构数据和噪声标签。

Method: 提出了一种基于FedRep算法的私有联邦学习算法，利用Johnson-Lindenstrauss变换降低共享嵌入和用户数据的有效维度。

Conclusion: 该方法在联邦学习环境下实现了高效且隐私保护的模型个性化，适用于更广泛的用户分布和噪声数据。

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to
singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study
the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization
algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE
analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of
high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in
PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very
high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related
to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we
obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in
\cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential
directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional
problems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in
distributed systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在优化奖励模型时可能出现的奖励黑客现象，并提出了一种名为HedgeTune的高效算法来缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型虽然能提升LLM性能，但作为复杂目标的代理，其不完美性可能导致奖励黑客现象，即过度优化奖励模型反而损害实际目标。

Method: 研究在推理时对齐中的奖励黑客现象，提出Best-of-Poisson（BoP）方法，并引入HedgeTune算法优化推理时参数。

Result: 实验表明，HedgeTune能有效缓解奖励黑客现象，并在奖励与失真之间实现更优权衡。

Conclusion: 通过合理对冲高奖励信号，可以避免奖励黑客现象，提升模型性能。

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在不同Gymnasium环境中的有效性，提供了对扰动的鲁棒性保证。

Conclusion: 全局Lipschitz正则化是提升行为克隆策略鲁棒性的有效方法。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;
Behavior Cloning; Lipschitz Neural Network

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图OOD分类中少数类性能下降和对结构噪声敏感的问题。

Method: 1. 约束均值优化（CMO）增强少数类鲁棒性；2. 邻居感知噪声重加权（NNR）动态调整样本权重。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了分类准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CMO和NNR方法有效解决了图OOD分类中的关键挑战，具有理论和实验支持。

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp
performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise.
This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the
underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2)
their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address
these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean
Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging
similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the
Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to
training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise
influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate
their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and
classification accuracy. The code for our method is available at:

### [166] [Efficient Extreme Operating Condition Search for Online Relay Setting Calculation in Renewable Power Systems Based on Parallel Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19289)
*Yan Li,Zengli Yang,Youhuai Wang,Jing Wang,Xiaoyu Han,Jingyu Wang,Dongyuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的并行图神经网络（PGNN）方法，用于解决电力系统中继电保护在线计算的极端运行条件搜索（EOCS）问题，显著提高了计算速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源的高渗透率和逆变器资源的广泛应用，电力系统的运行条件变得更加波动，传统的EOCS方法无法满足在线计算的效率需求。

Method: 将电力系统信息分为四个层次（组件参数层、拓扑连接层、电气距离层和图距离层），通过PGNN模型提取特征，并通过决策网络预测极端运行条件。

Result: 在改进的IEEE 39总线和118总线测试系统上验证了PGNN方法，结果表明其比现有方法具有更高的准确性和更快的在线计算时间。

Conclusion: PGNN方法为解决EOCS问题提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，适用于在线继电保护计算。

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了深度线性状态空间模型（SSMs）中深度和宽度对其表达能力的影响，证明了在无参数约束时深度和宽度等效，但在参数范数约束下深度更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度SSMs的深度和宽度如何影响其表达能力，填补理论空白。

Method: 通过理论证明和构造性方法，分析深度和宽度在有无参数约束下的等效性及差异。

Result: 无约束时深度和宽度等效；有约束时深度更优，能表示更大范数的目标。

Conclusion: 深度SSMs在参数范数约束下更具优势，为设计高效模型提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

*Ahmad Mohammad Saber,Aditi Maheshwari,Amr Youssef,Deepa Kundur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对智能电网中虚假数据注入攻击（FDIAs）检测的深度学习方案（DLSs）的新型对抗攻击框架，并展示了其高成功率。同时，通过对抗训练显著提升了模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网中虚假数据注入攻击（FDIAs）对深度学习检测方案（DLSs）的威胁日益严重，需要研究其脆弱性和防御措施。

Method: 利用快速梯度符号方法（FGSM）设计对抗攻击框架，通过微小扰动欺骗DLSs，并评估多种深度学习模型在对抗条件下的表现。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型对对抗攻击高度脆弱，某些攻击成功率超过99.7%。对抗训练显著提升了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击对DLSs构成重大威胁，对抗训练是有效的防御手段，智能电网需加强网络安全措施。

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant
attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CroMoTEX是一种基于对比学习的框架，利用胸部X光片训练学习临床信息丰富的心电图表示，用于多种心脏相关病理诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代诊断工作流程日益多模态化，心电图（ECG）和胸部X光片（CXR）是心脏评估中最常用的两种方式。ECG更易获取，适合早期预警系统，而CXR提供更丰富的诊断信息。

Method: CroMoTEX通过监督跨模态对比目标与自适应硬负样本加权，对齐ECG和CXR表示，实现稳健且任务相关的特征学习。测试时仅需ECG输入。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV-ECG和MIMIC-CXR数据集上，CroMoTEX在所有三种病理（心脏肥大、胸腔积液和水肿）中均优于基线，水肿的AUROC高达78.31。

Conclusion: CroMoTEX通过跨模态学习提升了ECG的诊断能力，适用于CXR不可用的实际场景。

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time
series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two
of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide
rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable
early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive
learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and
task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG
input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be
unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets,
CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to
78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at

Motivation: 全球道路交通事故致死率高，需准确数据支持预防策略和政策制定，但酒精推断不匹配（AIM）问题亟待解决。

Method: 开发框架结合BERT模型分析车祸数据，使用Probit Logit模型统计工具探索AIM模式的影响因素。

Result: 发现AIM占比24.03%，酒精相关致命事故和夜间事故AIM较低，未知车辆类型和老年司机事故AIM较高。

Conclusion: 需针对性培训和数据管理团队以提高车祸报告准确性，支持基于证据的政策制定。

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting
and support evidence-based policymaking.

Conclusion: DGMAE在异质性图上表现出色，显著提升了图自监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

Conclusion: Transformer通过上下文学习实现了贝叶斯奥卡姆剃刀原则，可能是其训练多样性的固有特性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

Motivation: 电磁结构设计面临高维空间和昂贵评估的挑战，现有方法数据密集且难以适应实际规模和预算限制。

Method: PQS将传统图像布局转换为四叉树分层表示，逐步搜索全局到局部细节，并引入一致性驱动样本选择机制。

Result: 在双频选择表面和高增益天线任务中，PQS显著降低评估成本（75-85%），节省20.27-38.80天设计周期。

Conclusion: PQS在有限预算下高效完成电磁结构设计，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fourier神经算子在处理复杂偏微分方程时需要增加傅里叶模式，导致模型参数激增，超参数调优计算成本高昂。

Method: 基于Maximal Update Parametrization（μP）框架，提出μTransfer-FNO技术，通过数学推导实现超参数在不同规模FNO模型间的迁移。

Result: 实验验证了μTransfer-FNO在多种偏微分方程上的有效性，显著降低了大型FNO模型的超参数调优计算成本，同时保持或提升准确性。

Conclusion: μTransfer-FNO为大规模FNO模型的超参数调优提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了因果发现的效果，且标签关系符合常识。

Conclusion: 基于标签的方法优于单一类型方法，为因果发现提供了更灵活和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement
method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms
to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is
simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a
few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning
to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing
algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo
environments.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

Motivation: 当前MU技术的漏洞研究不足，且现有攻击方法需访问原始模型，违背了MU的隐私保护目标。

Method: 提出MRA框架，利用教师-学生知识蒸馏架构，将ULM作为噪声标签器，转化为噪声标签学习问题。

Result: 实验表明MRA能高效恢复遗忘实例的类别成员关系。

Conclusion: 研究为未来MU漏洞研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

Motivation: 大型深度学习模型在噪声标签数据上性能显著下降，目前缺乏有效的恢复方法。

Method: 采用基于神经科学遗忘机制的COLUR框架，通过协同训练架构实现噪声标签影响的遗忘和模型信心的再学习。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，COLUR在模型恢复和细化方面优于其他SOTA方法。

Conclusion: COLUR框架有效解决了噪声标签导致的模型性能下降问题。

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

Motivation: 自然出现的符号公式中变量通常以固定组合出现，通过替换这些组合可以减少变量数量，但找到有效替换具有挑战性。

Method: 搜索小替换表达式空间并测试其有效性，将有效性测试简化为功能依赖性测试，形成迭代降维过程。

Result: 该方法能可靠识别有效替换，并显著提升多种先进符号回归算法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的迭代降维方法能有效减少变量数量，提升符号回归算法的表现。

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证误差的优化可能因随机性和重采样策略导致泛化性能下降，但这一现象（称为过度调优）在HPO和AutoML领域研究较少。

Method: 通过大规模重新分析HPO基准数据，定义过度调优并评估其普遍性和严重性。

Result: 研究表明过度调优比预期更常见，约10%的情况下会导致选择看似最优但泛化性能更差的配置。

Conclusion: 需提高对过度调优的认识，特别是在小数据场景下，并进一步研究缓解策略。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

Conclusion: 搜索式符号回归为ODE对称性发现提供了一种有效的新途径。

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when
it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated
solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer
algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying
them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these
symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in
symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic
expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the
task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can
find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过预留空间适应新类，但原型偏差和结构固定性限制了嵌入空间的表达能力。

Method: 设计了基于海马体联想记忆的原型校准和动态结构匹配，确保特征和结构的一致性。

Result: 在mini-ImageNet和CUB200基准测试中，ConCM性能最优，增量会话的谐波准确率分别提升3.20%和3.68%。

Conclusion: ConCM通过几何最优性和最大匹配性，克服了对类数先验的需求，显著提升了FSCIL的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

Conclusion: FAF框架在多任务和少样本时间序列预测中表现出色，实现了鲁棒且个性化的预测。

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design
and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to
the grid.

Result: 发现大型模型在完整似然方法下性能提升，而传统统计量方法中无改进；更多特征可提升预测效果。

Conclusion: DeepWAS方法通过优化模型规模和特征利用，有望改进疾病预测和治疗靶点识别。

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data
sets.

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse

hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that
tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5
dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer
model.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的张量并行训练需要大量通信同步激活，导致带宽需求高。

Method: 提出CAAT-Net，通过少量调整减少激活同步通信，训练1B和7B参数模型。

Result: 通信需求降低50%，预训练准确性无显著下降，训练和推理速度提升。

Conclusion: CAAT-Net有效减少通信开销，提升LLM训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with
tensor-parallelism requires substantial communication to synchronize
activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current
practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations,
reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for
Tensor-parallelism" (CAAT-Net). We train 1B and 7B parameter CAAT-Net models,
with a 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication and no significant drop
in pretraining accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CAAT-Net accelerates
both training and inference workloads.

Result: 实验表明，方法比现有技术减少20%的测试误分类，并扩展到自然语言处理任务。

Conclusion: 新方法在理论和实验上均优于现有技术，且对注释质量的重要性提供了实践见解。

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够保持预测集的覆盖概率，同时减少校准需求。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持共形预测理论性能的同时，显著提升了其实用性。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

Conclusion: 该方法在最小化内存占用方面表现出巨大潜力，适用于基于记忆的持续学习算法。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

Motivation: 数据隐私问题日益突出，需要能在不泄露敏感信息的情况下进行深度学习的方案，现有方法多限于加密推理或简单模型训练。

Method: 提出ReBoot框架，采用CKKS同态加密方案，设计基于局部误差信号的神经网络架构，优化乘法深度和噪声累积，结合SIMD操作和近似自举技术。

Conclusion: ReBoot为机器学习即服务提供了高效的全加密训练方案，显著提升了隐私保护深度学习的可行性和性能。

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public
repository.

TL;DR: 论文提出Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP)方法，通过预防极端激活异常值，提升大语言模型量化性能，实现高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中的极端激活异常值严重降低量化性能，阻碍设备端部署。现有方法难以有效缓解这一问题。

Method: OSP结合三项创新：Muon优化器、单尺度RMSNorm和可学习嵌入投影，从训练阶段预防异常值形成。

Result: 在1.4B参数模型上验证，OSP模型在4位量化下性能显著提升（35.7 vs 26.5），且训练开销仅增加2%。

Conclusion: 研究表明异常值并非大语言模型固有特性，而是训练策略的结果，为高效部署开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints

Result: 方法在IEEE 8500总线测试网络中表现优异，性能优于随机策略和优化方案，计算时间大幅缩短。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性和可扩展性，能显著提升恢复效率和效果。

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,
depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and
scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power
restored.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CFG在实践中非常有效，但其提升生成质量、细节和提示对齐的机制尚未完全理解。论文旨在通过频域分析揭示CFG的作用机制。

Method: 提出频率解耦引导（FDG），将CFG分解为低频和高频分量，并为每个分量分别设置引导强度，避免标准CFG中统一尺度带来的问题。

Result: 实验表明，FDG在低引导尺度下提升图像质量，在高尺度下避免过饱和和多样性损失，显著改善了FID和召回率。

Conclusion: FDG是一种即插即用的替代方案，能够在不牺牲多样性的情况下提升生成样本的保真度。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有变分推断方法在权重空间中使用各向同性高斯近似，无法匹配神经网络的固有几何结构，需要更合理的量化不确定性方法。

Method: CAP利用von Mises-Fisher分布建模权重不确定性，通过解析推导将vMF浓度参数与激活噪声方差关联，并引入KL散度正则化器。

Result: 在CIFAR-10实验中，CAP显著降低了预期校准误差（5.6倍），并提供了可解释的逐层不确定性分析。

Conclusion: CAP为深度学习中的不确定性量化提供了一个理论严谨且实用的方法，计算开销小且易于集成到标准架构中。

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

<details>

Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法（如SHAP）无法量化神经网络单元对高维输出的贡献，因此需要一种新方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 通过系统性地破坏单元组合，MSA生成Shapley Modes，即与模型输出维度完全一致的单元贡献图。

Result: MSA在不同规模的模型中应用，揭示了正则化如何集中计算、LLM中的语言特定专家以及GAN中的像素生成层次。

Conclusion: MSA是一种强大的工具，可用于解释、编辑和压缩深度神经网络。

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种基于物理振动分析的数据预处理技术，通过提取数据中的关键特征来提升深度学习模型的训练稳定性和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习架构在数据输入网络后表现优异，但数据准备成为瓶颈。DRIFT旨在通过物理感知方式提取数据中最具信息量的特征，减少噪声干扰。

Method: DRIFT将图像投影到由板的振动模式形状形成的低维基上，生成物理基础的特征集，显著减少输入维度。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR100上，DRIFT仅需50至100个特征即可达到与标准像素模型相当的分类精度，且在训练稳定性、抗过拟合和泛化鲁棒性上表现优越。

Conclusion: DRIFT通过物理驱动的数据转换，将焦点从架构设计转向输入优化，为深度学习性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

Result: 实验表明，NCT在单次前向传递中实现了最先进的可控生成，质量和计算效率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NCT是一种模块化、数据高效且易于部署的方法，显著提升了可控生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索在不同维度情况下（高维和低维）在线凸优化的最优遗憾表现，并研究是否需要自适应正则化。

Method: 使用Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) 方法，并分析时间变化和固定正则化的效果。

Result: 自适应正则化的FTRL在任何维度下都是最优的，而固定正则化方法在某一维度下会表现不佳。

Conclusion: 自适应正则化是必要的，固定正则化无法在所有维度下达到最优，且在ℓ_p-球的高维线性赌博机问题中无法实现次线性遗憾。

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all
$\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法需要大量手动调参以平衡模型复杂度和过拟合问题，本文旨在解决这一痛点。

Method: 通过将参数优化分为两部分：训练数据指导特征学习，验证数据调整正则化参数。该方法通过噪声注入在神经网络中实现。

Result: 实验显示该方法具有高噪声容忍度，并能自动生成架构特定的正则化模式。

Conclusion: 交叉正则化框架不仅简化了复杂度控制，还能无缝集成数据增强、不确定性校准等功能，同时保持高效的单次训练运行。

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO的新框架，扩展了Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)，以支持多目标动态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐技术（如RLHF）计算成本高且不稳定，而DPO及其扩展仅适用于静态偏好分布，无法满足多目标或动态对齐需求。

Method: 通过分类损失直接对齐语言模型，引入多个人类偏好维度（如帮助性、无害性、信息性），并通过可控的单纯形加权公式实现动态插值。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，该方法在静态目标上与DPO效果相当，同时更具通用性和适应性。

Conclusion: 新框架为语言模型的多目标动态对齐提供了轻量级且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world

*Chenhao Si,Ming Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应权重调整方案，用于改进物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在求解偏微分方程时的收敛性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于PINNs通常基于有限点集优化，难以保证收敛和精度，因此需要一种新方法来提升性能。

Method: 通过自适应调整损失函数中孤立点及其邻域的权重，优化PINNs的训练过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，该权重方案能显著降低相对L2误差。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应权重方案有效提升了PINNs的精度和收敛性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower
value.

*Vanessa Kosoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“模糊在线学习”的新变体，允许学习者生成多个预测标签，只要至少一个标签正确且没有“可预测错误”标签即视为正确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适用于多值动态系统、推荐算法和无损压缩等场景，并与“苹果品尝”问题相关。

Method: 通过假设类定义“可预测错误”，并分析学习者在多标签预测中的表现。

Result: 证明了在该设置下，错误界限存在三分法：Theta(1)、Theta(sqrt(N))或N。

Conclusion: 模糊在线学习为多标签预测问题提供了新的理论框架和界限分析。

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class
has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出四种基于机器学习的模型，模仿人类艺术策展人的工作，利用大都会艺术博物馆25年的展览数据，证明AI可以复制策展决策，且小型模型设计得当效果不输大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术策展依赖人类专家的主观判断，缺乏明确规则。研究旨在探索AI是否能通过学习历史展览数据模仿人类策展。

Method: 使用机器学习技术构建四种模型，分析大都会艺术博物馆25年的展览数据，通过特征工程和模型架构设计优化性能。

Result: 模型能有效复制历史展览，精度显著高于随机选择，且小型模型表现媲美大型语言模型。

Conclusion: AI策展模型在数据充足时有望接近人类策展水平，特征工程和小型模型设计是关键。

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

TL;DR: 研究发现，语言模型在微调后可能表现出广泛的‘突发性失调’行为，通过‘模型差异’方法揭示了内部特征，并提出少量良性样本微调可恢复对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型从训练到部署的泛化行为，特别是微调导致的‘突发性失调’现象及其机制。

Method: 采用‘模型差异’方法（稀疏自编码器）比较微调前后的内部表示，并测试多种微调条件（如强化学习、合成数据集）。

Result: 发现了控制‘突发性失调’的‘毒性人格特征’，并证明少量良性样本微调可有效恢复模型对齐。

Conclusion: 揭示了模型微调后失调的机制，并提出了一种简单有效的恢复方法。

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

### [213] [Scaling Speculative Decoding with Lookahead Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19830)
*Yichao Fu,Rui Ge,Zelei Shao,Zhijie Deng,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lookahead Reasoning通过利用步骤级并行性提升推理模型的解码速度，将SD的加速比从1.4倍提高到2.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token级推测解码（SD）的加速效果有限，因为长token猜测的正确率随长度指数下降。

Method: 提出Lookahead Reasoning，结合轻量级草稿模型生成多步推测，目标模型批量验证并保留语义正确的步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K等基准测试中，加速比从1.4倍提升至2.1倍，且答案质量不变。

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning通过步骤级并行性有效提升推理模型的解码效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OFTv2通过输入中心化重构和Cayley-Neumann参数化，显著降低了正交微调的计算和内存需求，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决正交微调（OFT）的高计算和内存成本问题，以提升实际部署的可行性。

Method: 提出OFTv2，采用输入中心化重构（矩阵-向量乘法）和Cayley-Neumann参数化（近似矩阵求逆）。

Result: OFTv2实现了10倍训练加速和3倍GPU内存节省，且在量化模型微调中优于QLoRA。

Conclusion: OFTv2是一种高效、实用的正交微调方法，适用于大规模模型部署。

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MATE，一种多模态可访问性多代理系统，通过模态转换满足用户需求，支持本地运行以确保隐私，并引入ModCon-Task-Identifier模型提升任务识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多代理系统因封闭设计缺乏定制化，无法全面支持残障用户需求，导致数字环境交互障碍。

Method: 提出MATE系统，支持多种模态转换和模型类型（如LLM API和自定义ML分类器），并开发ModCon-Task-Identifier模型精确提取用户任务。

Result: 实验表明ModCon-Task-Identifier在自定义数据上优于其他模型，系统可广泛应用于医疗等领域。

Conclusion: MATE通过灵活性和隐私保护，为残障用户提供有效支持，并展示了ModCon-Task-Identifier的优越性。

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many
technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs.
Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive
assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from
closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently
encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital
environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs
the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for
assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to
an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and
receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.
MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as
healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The
system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using
custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the
system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of
hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy
and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be
effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital
healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce
ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise
modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that
ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical
models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络暴力严重扰乱网络和现实秩序，现有研究多依赖宏观理论分析，缺乏微观与宏观结合的实际治理机制。

Method: 第一阶段构建四方的进化博弈模型，第二阶段引入旁观者并考虑情感因素，建立SBI1I2R模型。通过Matlab和Netlogo模拟验证。

Result: 强政府监管下适度惩罚误导策略的网络媒体效果最佳；网络媒体与政府协作干预最有效，其次是政府独立强监管。

Conclusion: 多阶段、多场景的治理机制结合案例分析和生命周期理论，增强了实际应用性。

Abstract: Cyber violence severely disrupts public order in both cyberspace and the real
world. Existing studies have gradually advocated collaborative governance but
rely on macro-level theoretical analyses. This study integrates micro- and
macro-level perspectives to propose a two-stage, multi-scenario governance
mechanism for cyber violence. In the first phase, a multi-scenario evolutionary
game model with four parties involved in cyber violence was developed based on
evolutionary game theory. Matlab simulations show that under strong government
regulation, moderate levels of punishment implemented by the government against
the online media that adopt misguidance strategies can achieve the most
desirable stable state. In the second phase, the role of bystanders was
introduced by integrating communication dynamics theory, and emotional factors
were considered alongside game strategies. This led to the development of a new
SBI1I2R model for public opinion dissemination in cyber violence. Netlogo
simulations found that increasing the "correct guidance" strategy by the online
media reduces the influence of cyber violence supporters and the time it takes
for their nodes to drop to zero, but does not significantly shorten the time
for the peak to occur. Comparatively, collaborative intervention between the
online media and the government was most effective in curbing public opinion,
followed by the government's independent "strong regulation." Relying solely on
the online media's "correct guidance" produced the weakest effect. Finally,
this mechanism was applied to a case study, and a multi-stage, multi-scenario
analysis based on life cycle theory enhanced its practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种时间正则化训练（TRT）方法，通过时间依赖的正则化机制缓解SNN的过拟合问题，提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN因事件驱动和低功耗特性受到关注，但直接训练的SNN因数据集规模小和梯度不匹配问题导致严重过拟合，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 引入时间依赖的正则化机制，对早期时间步施加更强约束，并通过Fisher信息分析验证其有效性。

Result: TRT在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，能有效缓解过拟合并平滑训练损失景观。

Conclusion: TRT通过时间衰减的正则化机制引导网络在信息丰富的时间步学习稳健特征，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to
their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly
effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have
shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to
the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching
problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In
this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by
introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger
constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other
state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,
ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of
TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape
visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can
effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,
thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical
interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results
of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics
inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process,
revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher
information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying
regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to
learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading
to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at

Result: 在多声源场景下，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 结合α稳定模型和神经网络的方法在多声源定位中表现优异。

Abstract: This paper describes a sound source localization (SSL) technique that
combines an $\alpha$-stable model for the observed signal with a neural
network-based approach for modeling steering vectors. Specifically, a
physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to
interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This
allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial
measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a
target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$
$\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to
leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer
in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed
technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound
sources.

Motivation: 现有音频伪造检测数据集缺乏多样化的口音，尤其是南亚地区，导致模型在实际场景中表现不佳。

Method: 构建了IFD数据集，包含真实和伪造音频，并评估了其与现有数据集（ASVspoof21和ITW）的性能对比。

Result: IFD在性能上优于ASVspoof21，且比ITW更具挑战性。

Conclusion: IFD填补了数据集的空白，为音频伪造检测提供了更全面的资源。

Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants,
better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment.
However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in
digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires
comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making
them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on
these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a
stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite
constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the
IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio
from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution
and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21
(DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF)
and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to
be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The dataset will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: The rapid rise of generative AI has transformed music creation, with millions
of users engaging in AI-generated music. Despite its popularity, concerns
regarding copyright infringement, job displacement, and ethical implications
have led to growing scrutiny and legal challenges. In parallel, AI-detection
services have emerged, yet these systems remain largely opaque and privately
controlled, mirroring the very issues they aim to address. This paper explores
the fundamental properties of synthetic content and how it can be detected.
Specifically, we analyze deconvolution modules commonly used in generative
models and mathematically prove that their outputs exhibit systematic frequency
artifacts -- manifesting as small yet distinctive spectral peaks. This
phenomenon, related to the well-known checkerboard artifact, is shown to be
inherent to a chosen model architecture rather than a consequence of training
data or model weights. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive
experiments on open-source models, as well as commercial AI-music generators
such as Suno and Udio. We use these insights to propose a simple and
interpretable detection criterion for AI-generated music. Despite its
simplicity, our method achieves detection accuracy on par with deep
learning-based approaches, surpassing 99% accuracy on several scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于谐波结构的F0估计算法（HAS），用于改进FFR中F0提取的性能，通过刺激感知滤波器组和选择最显著峰值的方法，显著降低了RMSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于FFR中F0的提取对语音处理至关重要，而传统方法（如ACF）在FFR中表现不佳，因此需要开发一种更有效的方法。

Method: 引入刺激感知滤波器组（HAS），选择性聚合F0及其谐波的振幅，并在刺激F0附近范围内评估候选F0；选择最显著峰值而非最高峰值。

Result: 在16名听力正常受试者的FFR数据中，HAS方法将RMSE降低了8.8%至47.4%，优于ACF。

Conclusion: HAS是首个基于谐波结构的FFR F0估计算法，显著提升了性能，为FFR分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: The Frequency Following Response (FFR) reflects the brain's neural encoding
of auditory stimuli including speech. Because the fundamental frequency (F0), a
physical correlate of pitch, is one of the essential features of speech, there
has been particular interest in characterizing the FFR at F0, especially when
F0 varies over time. The standard method for extracting F0 in FFRs has been the
Autocorrelation Function (ACF). This paper investigates
harmonic-structure-based F0 estimation algorithms, originally developed for
speech and music, and resolves their poor performance when applied to FFRs in
two steps. Firstly, given that unlike in speech or music, stimulus F0 of FFRs
is already known, we introduce a stimulus-aware filterbank that selectively
aggregates amplitudes at F0 and its harmonics while suppressing noise at
non-harmonic frequencies. This method, called Harmonic Amplitude Summation
(HAS), evaluates F0 candidates only within a range centered around the stimulus
F0. Secondly, unlike other pitch tracking methods that select the highest peak,
our method chooses the most prominent one, as it better reflects the underlying
periodicity of FFRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
propose an F0 estimation algorithm for FFRs that relies on harmonic structure.
Analyzing recorded FFRs from 16 normal hearing subjects to 4 natural speech
stimuli with a wide F0 variation from 89 Hz to 452 Hz showed that this method
outperformed ACF by reducing the average Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) within
each response and stimulus F0 contour pair by 8.8% to 47.4%, depending on the
stimulus.

Abstract: We tackle a new task of training neural network models that can assess
subjective impressions conveyed through speech and assign scores accordingly,
inspired by the work on automatic speech quality assessment (SQA). Speech
impressions are often described using phrases like `cute voice.' We define such
phrases as subjective voice descriptors (SVDs). Focusing on the difference in
usage scenarios between the proposed task and automatic SQA, we design a
framework capable of accommodating SVDs personalized to each individual, such
as `my favorite voice.' In this work, we compiled a dataset containing speech
labels derived from both abosolute category ratings (ACR) and comparison
category ratings (CCR).
  As an evaluation metric for assessment performance, we introduce ppref, the
accuracy of the predicted score ordering of two samples on CCR test samples.
Alongside the conventional model and learning methods based on ACR data, we
also investigated RankNet learning using CCR data. We experimentally find that
the ppref is moderate even with very limited training data. We also discover
the CCR training is superior to the ACR training. These results support the
idea that assessment models based on personalized SVDs, which typically must be
trained on limited data, can be effectively learned from CCR data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的TTS评估指标TTSDS2，并在多语言和多领域中验证其优于其他16种指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS系统评估方法（主观和客观指标）存在不足，尤其是对高质量合成语音的评估挑战。

Method: 提出TTSDS2指标，并发布数据集、测试管道和多语言基准。

Result: TTSDS2在所有领域和语言中均表现最佳（Spearman相关性>0.50）。

Conclusion: TTSDS2为TTS系统评估提供了更可靠的解决方案，并配套资源支持持续评估。

Abstract: Evaluation of Text to Speech (TTS) systems is challenging and
resource-intensive. Subjective metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are not
easily comparable between works. Objective metrics are frequently used, but
rarely validated against subjective ones. Both kinds of metrics are challenged
by recent TTS systems capable of producing synthetic speech indistinguishable
from real speech. In this work, we introduce Text to Speech Distribution Score
2 (TTSDS2), a more robust and improved version of TTSDS. Across a range of
domains and languages, it is the only one out of 16 compared metrics to
correlate with a Spearman correlation above 0.50 for every domain and
subjective score evaluated. We also release a range of resources for evaluating
synthetic speech close to real speech: A dataset with over 11,000 subjective
opinion score ratings; a pipeline for continually recreating a multilingual
test dataset to avoid data leakage; and a continually updated benchmark for TTS
in 14 languages.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Vo-Ve, a novel voice-vector embedding that captures
speaker identity. Unlike conventional speaker embeddings, Vo-Ve is explainable,
as it contains the probabilities of explicit voice attribute classes. Through
extensive analysis, we demonstrate that Vo-Ve not only evaluates speaker
similarity competitively with conventional techniques but also provides an
interpretable explanation in terms of voice attributes. We strongly believe
that Vo-Ve can enhance evaluation schemes across various speech tasks due to
its high-level explainability.

Result: 数值模拟验证了方法在两种通信拓扑下的有效性，实现了精确的领导者跟踪。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来结合数据驱动或强化学习的容错分布式自适应控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adaptive control strategies have progressively advanced to accommodate
increasingly uncertain, delayed, and interconnected systems. This paper
addresses the model reference adaptive control (MRAC) of networked,
heterogeneous, and unknown dynamical agents subject to both state and input
delays. The objective is to ensure that all follower agents asymptotically
track the trajectory of a stable leader system, despite system uncertainties
and communication constraints. Two communication topologies are considered,
full connectivity between each agent and the leader, and partial connectivity
wherein agents rely on both neighboring peers and the leader. The
agent-to-agent and agent-to-leader interactions are encoded using a
Laplacian-like matrix and a diagonal model-weighting matrix, respectively. To
compensate for the delays, a predictor-based control structure and an auxiliary
dynamic system are proposed. The control framework includes distributed
adaptive parameter laws derived via Lyapunov-based analysis, ensuring
convergence of the augmented tracking error. Stability conditions are
established through a carefully constructed Lyapunov Krasovskii functional,
under minimal assumptions on connectivity and excitation. Numerical simulations
of both network structures validate the proposed method, demonstrating that
exact leader tracking is achieved under appropriately designed learning rates
and initializations. This work lays a foundation for future studies on
fault-resilient distributed adaptive control incorporating data-driven or
reinforcement learning techniques.

Conclusion: DRL结合OED的方法在锂离子电池参数估计中具有高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation in electrochemical battery models is essential
for monitoring and assessing the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs).
This paper presents a novel approach that combines deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) with an optimal experimental design (OED) framework to identify key
electrochemical parameters of LiB cell models. The proposed method utilizes the
twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to optimize
input excitation, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the system response to
electrochemical parameters. The performance of this DRL-based approach is
evaluated against a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method and
conventional tests. Results indicate that the DRL-based method provides
superior information content, reflected in higher Fisher information (FI)
values and lower parameter estimation errors compared to the NMPC design and
conventional test practices. Additionally, the DRL approach offers a
substantial reduction in experimental time and computational resources.

Result: 该方法可行且高效，能够分析大规模模型，并比较了FOBNN与传统布尔语义反应网络的转换图。

Conclusion: 该方法为FOBNN分析开辟了新方向，深化了其与反应网络关系的理解。

Abstract: First-Order Boolean Networks with Non-deterministic updates (FOBNN) compute a
boolean transition graph representing the absence and presence of species over
time. The utility of FOBNNs has been justified by their theoretical soundness
with respect to the Euler simulation of the differential equations. However, we
lack practical means to work with FOBNNs and an empirical evaluation of their
properties. We present a sound and efficient reduction of the first-order FOBNN
transition relation to a propositional logic formula. This makes it possible to
use modern SAT solvers to reason on the full transition graph, even for large
models. We use this encoding to assess the feasibility and efficiency of
practical reasoning with FOBNNs. To do so, we focus on the computation of fixed
points. We also compare the transition graphs obtained via FOBNNs to those
computed by the classic boolean semantics of reaction networks. Overall, our
encoding opens new directions for the analysis of FOBNNs and deepens the
understanding of their relationship with reaction networks.

Motivation: 无人机在3D场景中的相对定位问题存在较多不确定性，而现有研究多集中于2D场景。受动物仅依赖个体感知实现群体行为的启发，本文探索了一种无基础设施的解决方案。

Method: 研究基于UWB传感器，开发了两种定位算法（基于欧氏距离矩阵和最大似然估计），并进行了理论分析、仿真和实地测试。

Result: 理论、仿真和实验结果验证了框架的有效性，尤其在近场定位任务中表现出较强的通用性和成本效益。

Abstract: Relative localization in the near-field scenario is critically important for
unmanned vehicle (UxV) applications. Although related works addressing 2D
relative localization problem have been widely studied for unmanned ground
vehicles (UGVs), the problem in 3D scenarios for unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) involves more uncertainties and remains to be investigated. Inspired by
the phenomenon that animals can achieve swarm behaviors solely based on
individual perception of relative information, this study proposes an
infrastructure-free 3D relative localization framework that relies exclusively
on onboard ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors. Leveraging 2D relative positioning
research, we conducted feasibility analysis, system modeling, simulations,
performance evaluation, and field tests using UWB sensors. The key
contributions of this work include: derivation of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) and geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) for near-field scenarios;
development of two localization algorithms -- one based on Euclidean distance
matrix (EDM) and another employing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE);
comprehensive performance comparison and computational complexity analysis
against state-of-the-art methods; simulation studies and field experiments; a
novel sensor deployment strategy inspired by animal behavior, enabling
single-sensor implementation within the proposed framework for UxV
applications. The theoretical, simulation, and experimental results demonstrate
strong generalizability to other 3D near-field localization tasks, with
significant potential for a cost-effective cross-platform UxV collaborative
system.

Conclusion: 展示了LLM驱动控制设计的潜力，为模型预测控制和强化学习等高级技术铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional control system design, reliant on expert knowledge and precise
models, struggles with complex, nonlinear, or uncertain dynamics. This paper
introduces AgenticControl, a novel multi-agent framework that automates
controller design using coordinated Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Through
structured JSON communication, these agents handle tasks including controller
selection, scenario design, parameter optimization, performance evaluation, and
decision-making. Through an actor-critic optimization approach, the system
iteratively improves performance while progressing through scenarios of
increasing complexity to ensure robustness under nominal conditions,
measurement noise, actuator disturbances, and parametric uncertainties. Key
innovations include structured multi-agent collaboration, robust optimization
mechanisms, and real-time adaptability via in-context learning. Validated
across four diverse control systems, namely, DC Motor Position control, Ball
and Beam, Inverted Pendulum, and Double Inverted Pendulum, the framework
achieves competitive performance against classical methods. Its Full State
Feedback solution closely matches Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) results,
while the designed PID controller significantly outperforming MATLAB's
PIDTuner, reducing PID tracking error by 55% through adaptive parameter
exploration. A comparative study of five LLM models reveals distinct
optimization profiles, with DeepSeek achieving the fastest convergence. This
work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven control design, paving the way
for advanced techniques like model predictive control and reinforcement
learning.

Method: 提出BiLSTM-PINN模型，并与物理信息全连接神经网络（FCNN）和BiLSTM进行对比，通过阶跃响应测试评估性能。

Result: BiLSTM-PINN和BiLSTM的中位RMSE分别比FCNN高9倍和4.5倍，标准差更小，表现更稳定。

Conclusion: BiLSTM-PINN是电力电子仿真的潜在替代方案，兼具速度和精度优势。

Abstract: The growing reliance on power electronics introduces new challenges requiring
detailed time-domain analyses with fast and accurate circuit simulation tools.
Currently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on
physics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that
data-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed
with limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before
deployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a
physics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network
(BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc
boost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A
physics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also
trained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using
step-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of
accuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform
the FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median
RMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than
the FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the
proposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or
data-driven methods for power electronics simulations.

Result: 算法在有限观测下能识别真实秩，随观测增加一致估计矩阵分量，并具有渐近正态性。

Conclusion: 算法在非平稳条件下高效且准确，理论分析和数值模拟验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a two-stage online algorithm for recovery of low-rank
parameter matrix in non-stationary stochastic systems. The first stage applies
the recursive least squares (RLS) estimator combined with its singular value
decomposition to estimate the unknown parameter matrix within the system,
leveraging RLS for adaptability and SVD to reveal low-rank structure. The
second stage introduces a weighted nuclear norm regularization criterion
function, where adaptive weights derived from the first-stage enhance low-rank
constraints. The regularization criterion admits an explicit and online
computable solution, enabling efficient online updates when new data arrive
without reprocessing historical data. Under the non-stationary and the
non-persistent excitation conditions on the systems, the algorithm provably
achieves: (i) the true rank of the unknown parameter matrix can be identified
with a finite number of observations, (ii) the values of the matrix components
can be consistently estimated as the number of observations increases, and
(iii) the asymptotical normality of the algorithm is established as well. Such
properties are termed oracle properties in the literature. Numerical
simulations validate performance of the algorithm in estimation accuracy.

Result: 在电压约束条件下，提出的市场机制能有效实现统一电价，平衡供需。

Conclusion: DOEs为产消者参与电力市场提供了公平且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of rooftop solar backed by battery storage is
enabling energy customers to both produce and consume electricity (i.e.,
prosumers of electricity). To facilitate prosumer participation in the electric
grid, new market mechanisms are required. In this paper, we design peer-to-peer
energy markets where prosumers trade their excess energy with peers to gain
profit while satisfying the overall balance in electricity supply and demand.
We first consider a market structure, considering the case where voltage and/or
thermal constraints are binding. When such grid constraints are binding, market
clearing prices can vary across locations. However, heterogeneous prices may be
considered by regulators to lack fairness. To ensure uniform pricing, we design
two peer-to-peer energy markets with dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). DOEs
enable us to decompose global voltage and thermal constraints across the power
grid into local constraints for each prosumer, resulting in uniform prices
across the grid. By means of numerical simulations on an IEEE 13-node feeder,
we benchmark the proposed market-based approaches in the presence of binding
voltage constraints.

Conclusion: 该框架仅依赖逆变器测量数据，无需电网全状态信息，更具实用性，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient Residual Reinforcement Learning (RRL)
framework for voltage control in active distribution grids. Voltage control
remains a critical challenge in distribution grids, where conventional
Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often suffer from slow training convergence
and inefficient exploration. To overcome these challenges, the proposed RRL
approach learns a residual policy on top of a modified Sequential Droop Control
(SDC) mechanism, ensuring faster convergence. Additionally, the framework
introduces a Local Shared Linear (LSL) architecture for the Q-network and a
Transformer-Encoder actor network, which collectively enhance overall
performance. Unlike several existing approaches, the proposed method relies
solely on inverters' measurements without requiring full state information of
the power grid, rendering it more practical for real-world deployment.
Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the RRL framework in achieving
rapid convergence, minimizing active power curtailment, and ensuring reliable
voltage regulation.

Abstract: As power systems evolve with increasing production from Inverter-Based

that can jeopardize system operation, leading to poorly damped oscillations or
small-signal rotor angle instability. In this work, we investigate whether
Power System Stabilizer (PSS) setting adjustments can effectively restore

penetration, using the benchmark Kundur Two-Area System as a case study.
Specifically, we evaluate the model-based Residues and P-Vref PSS tuning
methods to examine their effectiveness under evolving grid conditions. Our
findings indicate that the effectiveness of these tuning methods is not
guaranteed, particularly when coordination is limited. Consequently, our case
study motivates local and adaptive online PSS tuning methods.

Abstract: Beam squint poses a fundamental challenge in wideband hybrid beamforming,
particularly for mmWave and THz systems that demand both ultra-wide bandwidth
and high directional beams. While conventional phase shifter-based beamformers
may offer partial mitigation, True Time Delay (TTD) units provide a
fundamentally more effective solution by enabling frequency-independent beam
steering. However, the high cost of TTD units has recently driven much interest
in Sparse-TTD architectures, which combine a limited number of TTDs with a
higher number of conventional phase shifters to balance performance and cost.
This paper provides a critical examination of beam squint mitigation strategies
in wideband hybrid beamformers, comparing Full-TTD, Sparse-TTD, and Non-TTD
architectures. We analyze recent Non-TTD approaches, specifically the scheme
leveraging the wideband beam gain (WBBG) concept, evaluating their performance
and cost characteristics against TTD-based solutions. A key focus is placed on
the practical limitations of Sparse-TTD architectures, particularly the
often-overlooked requirement for wideband phase shifters operating alongside
TTDs, which can significantly impact performance and implementation cost in
real-world scenarios, especially for ultra-wideband applications. Finally, we
conduct a cost-performance analysis to examine the trade-offs inherent in each
architecture and provide guidance on selecting the most suitable hybrid
beamforming structure for various fractional bandwidth regimes.

Abstract: During grid faults, grid-forming converters are typically suggested to switch
from a voltage-source to a current-source mode to limit the current and protect
the electronics. This transition has the potential for the converter to
transiently lose synchronization due to such current saturation. Therefore,
this paper proposes an alternative current saturation algorithm to improve
transient synchronization stability during mode switching. The algorithm is
designed for grid-forming converters to meet low-voltage ride-through (LVRT)
requirements and grid-fault standards in addition to transient synchronization
stability. Moreover, it limits the converter output current during grid faults
with a new control parameter. The presented method introduces converter output
virtual fluxes to calculate the current references in the d- and q-axes for the
current saturation algorithm to enhance LVRT performance and grid stability.
The method exploits the correlation between the converter's virtual fluxes and
currents to modify the current saturation levels through real-time converter
virtual flux estimation. The adaptive saturation levels ensure precise control
and high dynamics during grid faults and facilitate optimal power injection or
absorption to support the grid. The proposed current-saturation algorithm is
analytically evaluated. Further, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有制导策略可能因忽略拦截器的视场和作动器限制而导致性能下降，因此需要一种新方法直接将这些约束纳入设计。

Method: 采用输入仿射幅度饱和模型，将其与拦截器运动学方程结合，设计出考虑传感器和作动器物理限制的制导律。

Result: 通过多种场景的数值模拟验证了所提策略的有效性，并与现有制导策略进行了对比。

Conclusion: 所提出的制导方案能够有效实现预定时间的精确拦截，同时满足物理约束。

Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear guidance scheme designed to achieve precise
interception of stationary targets at a pre-specified impact time. The proposed
strategy essentially accounts for the constraints imposed by the interceptor's
seeker field-of-view (FOV) and actuator limitations, which, if ignored, can
degrade guidance performance. To address these challenges, the guidance law
incorporates known actuator bounds directly into its design, thereby improving
overall interceptor effectiveness. The proposed method utilizes an input-affine
magnitude saturation model to effectively enforce these constraints. By
appending this input saturation model to the interceptor's kinematic equations,
a guidance law is derived that ensures interception at the desired impact time
while accounting for the physical constraints of the sensor and actuator. The
efficacy of the proposed strategies is demonstrated through comprehensive
numerical simulations across various scenarios and is compared against an
existing guidance strategy.

Result: 证明了有限时域策略在满足条件下收敛于无限时域FNE，并给出了成本差异的上界。

Conclusion: 有限时域策略在无限时域博弈中具有收敛性，且随着预测时域T的增加，成本差异趋近于零。

Abstract: This paper explores a finite-horizon strategy, ``watching $T$ steps into the
future and moving one step now,'' in an $N$-person infinite-horizon
discrete-time linear-quadratic dynamic game. The game involves linear
input/output/state dynamics and quadratic cost functions with heterogeneous
discount factors. For the finite-horizon version, which forms the basis of the
infinite-horizon game, we analyze the structure of the coupled generalized
discrete Riccati difference equations related to the feedback Nash equilibrium
(FNE) and derive a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the
finite-horizon FNE. Under this condition, the FNE can be efficiently computed
via the proposed algorithm. In the infinite-horizon game, assume all players
adopt this finite-horizon strategy. If the iterations of the coupled equations
related to the FNE converge, and the invertibility and stability conditions
hold, we prove the convergence of each player's total cost under the
finite-horizon strategy, even when players use individual prediction horizons.
Furthermore, we provide an explicit upper bound on the cost difference between
the finite-horizon strategy and the infinite-horizon FNE associated with the
limiting matrices, expressed via the distance between their feedback strategy
matrices. This bound vanishes as $T$ tends to infinity, implying convergence to
the infinite-horizon FNE cost. A non-scalar numerical example illustrates the
convergence behavior.

Abstract: An Attitude Determination and Control System is essential for orientation
stability and performance of slew maneuvers on the satellite. This research
focuses on comparing two different geomagnetic field models, Direct Dipole
Model and International Geomagnetic Reference Field Model, for modeling of
magnetometer and magnetorquers. Both these magnetic field models are compared
and analyzed for two satellite attitude cases: orientation stability and
unloading of reaction wheels. Magnetometer modeling is utilized to get sensor
data for attitude determination and control to attain orientation stability.
Whereas, the magnetorquer model aids in reaction wheel unloading, by performing
the required actuation on the satellite, upon interaction with the Earth's
magnetic field. The study offers a comprehensive lookout on the impact of
geomagnetic field models on the overall ADCS performance, incorporating both
attitude estimation and control via the sensor and actuator modeling. Apart
from this, valuable insights are gained into selecting optimal models based on
specific mission requirements and available computational resources. Finally,
this comparison and analysis results in unique findings for an actual future
satellite mission, that is to be launched soon.

Abstract: Owing to the advanced communication networks and intelligent electronic
devices, the cyber-physical distribution systems (CPDSs) possess the capability
to perform flexible economic dispatch and achieve rapid self-healing from
extreme events. Meanwhile, the deep integration of cyber and physical systems
makes CPDS vulnerable to coordinated cyber-physical attacks. In this paper, a
resilience assessment framework for the CPDS under coordinated cyber-physical
attacks is proposed to investigate the impact of the coordinated attacks on
load loss and service restoration in CPDS. First, a three-stage
defender-attacker-defender dynamic game model considering fake base station
(FBS) and physical attacks for CPDS is established, aiming at seeking the
optimal defense resource deployment strategy to enhance the resilience of the
CPDS. The physical attack is launched to cause faults on the power lines, and
the FBS attack is employed to interrupt the service of wireless cellular
network to hinder the self-healing process of the CPDS. The lognormal shadowing
model and search theory are applied to quantitatively describe the process of
the coordinated cyber-physical attacks. Further, the constructed three-stage
dynamic game model is equivalently recast as a tri-level max-min-max
optimization model, which is solved using column-and-constraint generation
combined with enumeration method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed
resilience assessment framework and solution strategy is demonstrated by
conducting simulation analysis on the modified IEEE 33-node CPDS and a
real-world 47-node CPDS in China.

Conclusion: 该方法具有在边缘设备上部署的潜力，避免了在线优化的计算负担。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to solving input- and state-constrained
parametric mixed-integer optimal control problems using Differentiable
Predictive Control (DPC). Our approach follows the differentiable programming
paradigm by learning an explicit neural policy that maps control parameters to
integer- and continuous-valued decision variables. This policy is optimized via
stochastic gradient descent by differentiating the quadratic model predictive
control objective through the closed-loop finite-horizon response of the system
dynamics. To handle integrality constraints, we incorporate three
differentiable rounding strategies. The approach is evaluated on a conceptual
thermal energy system, comparing its performance with the optimal solution for
different lengths of the prediction horizon. The simulation results indicate
that our self-supervised learning approach can achieve near-optimal control
performance while significantly reducing inference time by avoiding online
optimization, thus implying its potential for embedded deployment even on edge
devices.

### [244] [Decision-Focused Learning for Neural Network-Constrained Optimization: Application to HVAC Management System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19717)

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于混合整数二次规划（MIQP）和神经网络的HVAC管理系统，采用决策聚焦学习（DFL）优化性能，并通过随机平滑（SS）解决梯度问题。实验表明，该方法在成本节约和电网服务性能上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HVAC系统在电网服务中具有巨大潜力，但建筑热动力学的非线性与重复行为使得建模困难，历史数据价值降低。

Method: 将HVAC管理问题建模为MIQP，嵌入神经网络作为混合整数线性约束，采用DFL优化性能，并通过SS解决梯度问题。

Result: 实验表明，SS-DFL方法在成本节约和电网服务性能上优于传统两阶段和松弛DFL方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了可扩展的电网交互建筑控制潜力。

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is a major electricity
end-use with a substantial potential for grid services such as demand response.
Harnessing this flexibility requires accurate modeling of the thermal dynamics
of buildings, which is challenging due to their nonlinear and repetitive
behavior (e.g., daily pattern), which reduce the value of historical data. To
address this issue, this paper presents an HVAC management system formulated as
a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP), where Neural Network (NN) models of
thermal dynamics are embedded as exact mixed-integer linear constraints. We
employ Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) which tunes the NN parameters to improve
the HVAC performance rather than prediction metrics. However, the discrete
nature of the MIQP poses challenges for this approach, as it leads to gradients
that are undefined or discontinuous, thus impeding standard gradient-based
training. Here, we employ Stochastic Smoothing (SS), which enables efficient
gradient computation without the need to differentiate through the MIQP.
Experiments on a realistic five-zone building using a high-fidelity building
simulator demonstrate that the proposed SS-DFL approach outperforms
conventional two-stage and relaxed DFL methods in both cost savings and grid
service performance, highlighting its potential for scalable, grid-interactive
building control.

Abstract: This paper presents a Model-Inspired Distributionally Robust Data-enabled
Predictive Control (MDR-DeePC) framework for systems with partially known and
uncertain dynamics. The proposed method integrates model-based equality
constraints for known dynamics with a Hankel matrix-based representation of
unknown dynamics. A distributionally robust optimization problem is formulated
to account for parametric uncertainty and stochastic disturbances. Simulation
results on a triple-mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved disturbance
rejection, reduced output oscillations, and lower control cost compared to
standard DeePC. The results validate the robustness and effectiveness of
MDR-DeePC, with potential for real-time implementation pending further
benchmarking.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保证性能的同时，显著降低了对抗传感器的可观测性。

Abstract: We develop a feedback controller that minimizes the observability of a set of
adversarial sensors of a linear system, while adhering to strict closed-loop
performance constraints. We quantify the effectiveness of adversarial sensors
using the trace of their observability Gramian and its inverse, capturing both
average observability and the least observable state directions of the system.
We derive theoretical lower bounds on these metrics under performance
constraints, characterizing the fundamental limits of observability reduction
as a function of the performance tradeoff. Finally, we show that the
performance-constrained optimization of the Gramian's trace can be formulated
as a one-shot semidefinite program, while we address the optimization of its
inverse through sequential semidefinite programming. Simulations on an aircraft
show how the proposed scheme yields controllers that deteriorate adversarial
observability while having near-optimal closed-loop performance.

Conclusion: 医疗影像模型对模型窃取攻击具有显著脆弱性，QueryWise方法在有限预算下表现出色。

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.
