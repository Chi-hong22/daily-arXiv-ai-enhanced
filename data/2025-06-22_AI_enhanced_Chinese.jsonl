One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering\naudio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment. Recent\nadvances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of\nhigh-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance.\nHowever, the effect of source separation has not been systematically\ninvestigated in order to establish best practices for its use. This work\nexamines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a\nstate-of-the-art open source ASR model. We evaluate Whisper's performance on\noriginal audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and\nlong-form transcription tasks.

In-context\nlearning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image\nclassification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without\ngradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a\ncritical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.\nIn this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding\nmodel -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center\nof analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder\ntypes, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC\nperformance. Our experiments show that the training success and the\nout-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are\npretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based\nFSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the\ntraining distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.\nCode can be found at https://github.com/PictSure/pictsure-library.", "AI": {"tldr": "PictSure是一个专注于图像嵌入模型的ICL框架，通过系统分析视觉编码器类型、预训练目标和微调策略，显著提升了少样本图像分类的跨域性能。", "motivation": "在数据稀缺领域，构建图像分类模型困难，ICL虽有望解决少样本分类问题，但现有研究忽视了图像嵌入模型的关键作用。", "method": "提出PictSure框架，系统研究视觉编码器类型、预训练目标和微调策略对少样本分类性能的影响。", "result": "实验表明，嵌入模型的预训练方式对训练成功和跨域性能至关重要，PictSure在跨域任务上优于现有方法。", "conclusion": "PictSure通过优化嵌入模型设计，显著提升了少样本图像分类的跨域性能，同时保持域内任务表现。"}}

Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet.
