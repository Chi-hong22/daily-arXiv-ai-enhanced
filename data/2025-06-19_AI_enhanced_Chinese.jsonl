One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering\naudio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment. Recent\nadvances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of\nhigh-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance.\nHowever, the effect of source separation has not been systematically\ninvestigated in order to establish best practices for its use. This work\nexamines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a\nstate-of-the-art open source ASR model. We evaluate Whisper's performance on\noriginal audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and\nlong-form transcription tasks. For short-form, we suggest a concatenation\nmethod that results in a consistent reduction in Word Error Rate (WER). For\nlong-form, we propose an algorithm using source separation as a vocal activity\ndetector to derive segment boundaries, which results in a consistent reduction\nin WER relative to Whisper's native long-form algorithm. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art results for an open source system on the Jam-ALT long-form ALT\nbenchmark, without any training or fine-tuning.

However, integrating\nonline learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,\nwhere clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In\nreal-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the\ndisjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are\ntypically generated by an \\emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We\nare the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been\noverlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an\nevent-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients\nwere activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively\ncollaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated\n\\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by\nonline learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary\nenvironment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed\nframework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with\nevent-driven online VFL.
