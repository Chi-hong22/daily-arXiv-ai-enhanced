### [2] [Underwater Monocular Metric Depth Estimation: Real-World Benchmarks and Synthetic Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02148)
*Zijie Cai,Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了单目深度估计模型在水下环境中的性能，发现现有模型因域偏移表现不佳，提出了一种基于合成水下数据的微调方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境因光线衰减、散射和缺乏高质量数据，单目深度估计的可靠性受限，需研究域适应方法。

Method: 在合成水下数据集上微调Depth Anything V2模型，使用ViT-S编码器，并与真实水下数据集（如FLSea和SQUID）进行对比评估。

Result: 微调后的模型在所有基准测试中表现优于仅基于陆地数据训练的基线模型。

Conclusion: 域适应和尺度感知监督对水下环境中鲁棒的单目深度估计至关重要，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

*Gaochao Song,Zibo Zhao,Haohan Weng,Jingbo Zeng,Rongfei Jia,Shenghua Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh Silksong是一种高效紧凑的网格表示方法，通过自回归方式生成多边形网格，减少冗余并提升几何完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格标记化方法存在顶点重复标记的问题，浪费网络能力，因此需要一种更高效的表示方法。

Method: 通过仅访问每个网格顶点一次的方式标记化网格顶点，减少50%的冗余，并实现约22%的压缩率。

Result: 实验结果显示，Mesh Silksong不仅能生成复杂网格，还显著提升了几何完整性（如流形拓扑、水密检测和一致法线）。

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong在网格表示和生成方面表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

### [4] [ESTR-CoT: Towards Explainable and Accurate Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02200)
*Xiao Wang,Jingtao Jiang,Qiang Chen,Lan Chen,Lin Zhu,Yaowei Wang,Yonghong Tian,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于链式思维推理的事件流场景文本识别框架（ESTR-CoT），结合视觉编码器和大型语言模型，提升了在低光照和快速运动等极端场景下的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极端场景（如低光照、快速运动）下表现不佳，且缺乏解释性和上下文逻辑推理能力。

Method: 采用EVA-CLIP视觉编码器将事件流转换为token，结合Llama分词器和Vicuna-7B大型语言模型，通过Q-former对齐视觉token，输出答案和推理过程。

Result: 在三个事件流STR基准数据集上验证了框架的有效性和解释性。

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT框架显著提升了事件流场景文本识别的性能，并提供了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

### [5] [HyperGaussians: High-Dimensional Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Animatable Face Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02803)
*Gent Serifi,Marcel C. Bühler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperGaussians是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的新型扩展，用于高质量可动画面部化身，通过高维多元高斯提升表现力，解决了非线性变形和复杂光照的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅技术在静态面部表现优异，但在可动画化面部化身中仍存在非线性变形和细节不足的问题。

Method: 提出HyperGaussians，通过高维多元高斯和局部嵌入提升表现力，并引入'逆协方差技巧'提高计算效率。

Result: 在19个受试者的4个面部数据集上，HyperGaussians在数值和视觉上均优于3DGS，尤其在细节表现上。

Conclusion: HyperGaussians为可动画面部化身提供了一种高效且表现力强的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本多模态方法，用于复合情感识别（CER），结合六种模态并通过动态加权和概率聚合生成可解释的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖任务特定训练数据的问题，探索零样本学习在复合情感识别中的应用。

Method: 使用CLIP和Qwen-VL进行零样本模态融合，引入MHPF模块动态加权预测，并通过PPA和PFSA方法生成复合情感输出。

Result: 在AffWild2、AFEW和C-EXPR-DB数据集上的F1分数分别为46.95%、49.02%和34.85%，与监督方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法无需领域适应即可有效捕捉复合情感，证明了零样本多模态方法的潜力。

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

### [7] [LiteReality: Graphics-Ready 3D Scene Reconstruction from RGB-D Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02861)
*Zhening Huang,Xiaoyang Wu,Fangcheng Zhong,Hengshuang Zhao,Matthias Nießner,Joan Lasenby*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteReality是一个将RGB-D扫描转换为紧凑、逼真且可交互的3D虚拟副本的管道，支持高质量渲染和物理交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从现实扫描创建逼真、可交互3D场景的挑战，适用于AR/VR、游戏、机器人等领域。

Method: 通过场景理解、3D模型检索、材质增强和物理引擎集成，构建可编辑的3D场景。

Result: 在Scan2CAD基准测试中实现最先进的相似性性能，并能处理复杂光照和遮挡。

Conclusion: LiteReality提供了一种高效的方法，生成兼容标准图形管道的逼真3D场景。

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

### [8] [SciGA: A Comprehensive Dataset for Designing Graphical Abstracts in Academic Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02212)
*Takuro Kawada,Shunsuke Kitada,Sota Nemoto,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SciGA-145k数据集，用于支持图形摘要（GA）的选择和推荐，并提出了两种任务和一种新评估指标CAR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图形摘要在科学传播中很重要，但设计和选择有效的GA存在挑战，需要大规模数据和自动化支持。

Method: 构建了包含145,000篇论文和1.14百万张图的SciGA-145k数据集，定义了Intra-GA和Inter-GA推荐任务，并提出CAR评估指标。

Result: 提供了基线模型和CAR指标，为GA推荐和生成研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k为科学视觉传播和AI研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

### [9] [Understanding Trade offs When Conditioning Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02217)
*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了在少量图像数据下学习鲁棒物体检测器的挑战，比较了基于提示和基于布局的两种条件策略，发现布局条件在多样性高时表现更优，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业视觉系统中高质量训练数据收集耗时，合成数据成为关键解决方案，但现有方法存在渲染时间长和仿真-现实差距大的问题。

Method: 研究80种视觉概念，比较基于提示和基于布局的两种条件策略，分析其对合成数据质量的影响。

Result: 布局条件在多样性高时表现更优，合成数据使平均精度提升34%，最高可达177%。

Conclusion: 布局条件策略在多样性高的场景下更有效，能显著提升物体检测性能。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

*Tian Gao,Zhiyuan Zhang,Kaijie Yin,Xu-Cheng Zhong,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIDB-ViT是一种新型的二值化视觉变换器，通过引入差分信息和频率分解，显著提升了性能，同时保持了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有二值化ViT方法性能下降严重或依赖全精度模块的问题。

Method: 设计了一个包含差分信息的注意力模块，采用离散Haar小波进行频率分解，并改进RPReLU激活函数。

Result: 在多种ViT架构中，DIDB-ViT显著优于现有网络量化方法，提升了图像分类和分割性能。

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT在保持高效的同时，有效缓解了二值化带来的信息损失，性能优越。

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMOcc提出了一种基于流匹配选择性状态空间模型的TPV细化占用网络，用于少帧3D占用预测，通过特征细化模块和选择性过滤提升效率和预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少帧图像和3D空间冗余导致的遮挡和远场景预测精度问题，避免现有方法需要额外数据和计算资源的限制。

Method: 设计了流匹配SSM模块（FMSSM）生成缺失特征，TPV SSM层和平面选择性SSM（PS3M）选择性过滤特征，以及掩码训练（MT）增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和OpenOcc数据集上表现优异，两帧输入下达到43.1% RayIoU和39.8% mIoU，推理内存5.4G，时间330ms。

Conclusion: FMOcc通过流匹配和选择性特征过滤显著提升了少帧3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法通常针对单一任务设计，难以应对复杂手术场景的多样化需求。

Method: 结合领域特定知识的先验模型，通过上下文少样本学习和思维链推理，实现定制化图像增强。

Result: 在模拟真实手术失真的基准测试中，SurgVisAgent表现优于传统单任务模型。

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent有望成为手术辅助的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version
will appear in the official conference proceedings.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域高光谱图像分类中因光谱偏移导致的性能下降问题。

Conclusion: BiDA框架有效提升了跨域高光谱图像分类的性能，尤其在噪声条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be
available from the website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像因光线变化、水体浑浊和气泡等问题导致可见性和颜色失真，传统方法效果不佳，且深度学习缺乏高质量数据集。

Method: 模型结合了Conditional 3D Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC)进行初步颜色校正和Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE)进行细节优化。

Result: 实验表明，MAC-Lookup在恢复细节和颜色方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAC-Lookup能有效增强水下图像，避免过度增强和饱和问题。

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater
challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing
underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

*Feizhen Huang,Yu Wu,Yutian Lin,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自蒸馏方法，用于扩展视频到音频（V2A）生成模型，以应对电影语言场景中部分可见目标的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前V2A方法忽略了电影语言这一关键艺术表达元素，导致在部分可见目标场景中性能下降。

Method: 采用自蒸馏方法，通过模拟电影语言变化，使学生模型学习视频特征与音频-视觉对应关系的对齐。

Result: 方法在部分可见场景下显著提升性能，并在VGGSound数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: 自蒸馏方法有效解决了V2A模型在电影语言场景中的局限性，提升了性能。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

TL;DR: LaCo是一种新型视觉令牌压缩框架，通过在视觉编码器的中间层进行压缩，显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌压缩方法多为后编码器模块，限制了效率提升潜力。

Method: LaCo引入层级的像素重组机制和残差学习架构，保留关键视觉信息。

Result: LaCo在中间层压缩中优于现有方法，训练效率提升20%，推理吞吐量提升15%。

Conclusion: LaCo在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率，是视觉令牌压缩的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

TL;DR: ViRefSAM是一种新框架，通过少量标注参考图像引导SAM，实现遥感图像的自动分割，解决了手动提示和领域适应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM在遥感图像分割中手动提示效率低和领域适应性不足的问题。

Method: 引入视觉上下文提示编码器和动态目标对齐适配器，利用少量参考图像生成对象感知提示并注入类特定语义。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，优于现有少样本分割方法。

Conclusion: ViRefSAM通过少量参考图像实现高精度自动分割，适用于遥感图像。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: DreamComposer++ 是一个改进现有视图感知扩散模型的框架，通过多视图条件生成可控的新视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成可控新视图时因缺乏多视图信息而受限。

Method: 利用视图感知3D提升模块提取多视图的3D表示，通过多视图特征融合模块聚合并渲染到目标视图的潜在特征中，再集成到预训练扩散模型中进行新视图合成。

Result: 实验表明，DreamComposer++ 能无缝集成现有模型，提升多视图条件下的可控新视图生成能力。

Conclusion: 该框架推动了可控3D对象重建，拓展了应用范围。

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Flow-CDNet的双分支网络，用于同时检测图像中的慢速和快速变化，并通过实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，慢速变化（如滑坡、大坝等）往往是重大灾害的前兆，因此需要同时检测慢速和快速变化的网络。

Method: Flow-CDNet包含两个分支：光流分支（提取多尺度位移变化）和二进制变化检测分支（结合ResNet和光流分支输出）。

Result: 在自建数据集Flow-Change上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，且两分支相互促进提升检测性能。

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet通过双分支设计有效解决了同时检测慢速和快速变化的挑战，并取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

Result: LMPNet能自动发现鲁棒的语义关键点，预测精度接近监督式姿态估计模型。

Conclusion: LMPNet通过直接操作网络过滤器检测预定义概念，具有高可解释性，适用于弱监督关键点发现。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

Motivation: 现有方法在脑视觉解码中依赖低层次像素对齐，缺乏细粒度语义对齐，导致重建失真。

Result: fMRI信号提升了检测和分割的准确性，证实其包含多对象语义和空间信息。

Conclusion: fMRI信号具有未充分利用的语义和空间信息潜力，可提升解码模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

Motivation: 工业质量控制中异常数据稀缺，现有扩散模型方法无法同时满足背景保留、掩码对齐和语义合理性的需求。

Method: MAGIC基于Stable Diffusion修复框架，结合高斯提示级扰动和掩码引导的空间噪声注入，并引入上下文感知掩码对齐模块。

Result: 在MVTec-AD数据集上，MAGIC在下游异常任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC通过多级扰动和上下文感知对齐，实现了高质量的少样本异常生成。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ControlNet++）仅关注最终去噪步骤的对齐，忽略了中间生成阶段，限制了其效果。

Method: InnerControl通过训练轻量级卷积探针，从中间UNet特征重建输入控制信号，并在整个扩散过程中最小化预测与目标条件之间的差异。

Result: 结合ControlNet++等技术，InnerControl在多种条件方法（如边缘、深度）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: InnerControl通过全步骤的空间一致性优化，显著提升了控制保真度和生成质量。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段神经网络方法，用于自动检测颅内动脉瘤（ICA）的关键标志点，即Willis环（CoW）的动脉分叉处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内动脉瘤常见于Willis环的特定分叉处，准确检测这些标志点对快速高效诊断至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段神经网络：首先用目标检测网络识别感兴趣区域（ROIs），随后用改进的U-Net精确定位分叉点。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在分叉检测任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法有效解决了标志点漏检和解剖变异问题，提升了检测准确性。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining

model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in

TL;DR: Hita是一种新型的自回归图像生成标记器，通过整体到局部的标记化方案和关键策略改进全局信息捕获，显著提升生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成模型逐步生成视觉标记，限制了全局关系的捕获，且现有标记器多关注局部信息，缺乏全局视角。

Method: Hita采用整体到局部的标记化方案，结合可学习的整体查询和局部补丁标记，并通过因果注意力和轻量融合模块优化信息流。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，Hita达到2.59 FID和281.9 IS，训练速度更快，并在零样本风格迁移和图像修复中表现优异。

Conclusion: Hita通过改进全局信息捕获和标记化策略，显著提升了自回归图像生成的性能和应用范围。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

TL;DR: LocalDyGS提出了一种新的动态场景重建框架，通过分解场景为局部空间并解耦静态与动态特征，解决了复杂动态视频合成的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中复杂且高度动态的运动使得从多视角输入合成任意视角的动态视频具有挑战性，现有方法难以建模大尺度运动。

Method: LocalDyGS将动态场景分解为基于种子的局部空间，并解耦静态与动态特征，通过静态特征和动态残差场生成时间高斯模型。

Result: 该方法在精细尺度数据集上表现优异，并首次尝试建模更大更复杂的高度动态场景。

Conclusion: LocalDyGS为高度动态场景的建模提供了一种更现实的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅需视频数据的新型伪标签框架，用于单目3D目标检测，解决了数据稀缺和2D-3D模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D目标检测面临数据稀缺和2D-3D模糊性问题，现有方法受限于领域特定学习或单视角形状信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法具有高准确性和强扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法为单目3D目标检测提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

TL;DR: CoMEL提出了一种持续多实例学习框架，通过高效实例编码、可靠伪标注和遗忘缓解技术，显著提升了WSI数据集的分类和定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多实例学习（MIL）在持续任务中的适应性，解决大规模WSI图像中实例分类和定位的遗忘问题。

Method: 结合GDAT、BPPL和OWLoRA技术，分别实现高效实例编码、可靠伪标注和遗忘缓解。

Result: 在三个公开WSI数据集上，CoMEL在持续MIL任务中表现优异，分类和定位准确率分别提升11.00%和23.4%。

Conclusion: CoMEL为MIL在持续学习中的应用提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能并减少了遗忘。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于像素级时间不一致性的深度伪造视频检测方法，通过1D傅里叶变换提取时间特征，结合注意力模块和联合变换器模块提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于空间频率的检测器忽略了像素级的时间不一致性，导致无法有效检测时间伪影。

Method: 对每个像素进行时间轴上的1D傅里叶变换，提取时间不一致特征；引入注意力模块定位伪影区域；联合变换器模块整合时空特征。

Result: 显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的鲁棒性，适用于多样化的检测场景。

Conclusion: 该方法通过关注像素级时间不一致性，为深度伪造检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

TL;DR: TAB Net是一种基于涂鸦注释的弱监督医学图像分割框架，通过三重增强自恢复模块和边界感知伪标签监督模块，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量标注数据，但获取成本高。涂鸦注释作为一种稀疏标注方式，虽然高效但缺乏边界监督，限制了模型性能。

Method: TAB Net包含三重增强自恢复模块（TAS）和边界感知伪标签监督模块（BAP）。TAS通过三种增强策略提升特征学习，BAP通过融合双分支预测和边界感知损失优化伪标签。

Result: 在ACDC和MSCMR seg数据集上，TAB Net优于现有弱监督方法，性能接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: TAB Net为稀疏标注医学图像分割提供了一种高效解决方案，性能接近全监督方法。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Conclusion: 结合扩散模型和自动编码器的方法在图像表示学习和伪影修复方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Motivation: 当前3D高斯编辑方法无法满足实现真实化妆效果的基本要求，包括动态表情下的外观一致性、身份保持以及精细细节控制。

Method: 采用从粗到细的策略，首先通过Coherent Duplication方法确保一致性和身份保持，然后通过Refinement Module提升细节质量。

Result: 实验表明，AvatarMakeup在化妆转移质量和动画一致性上达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup方法有效解决了3D虚拟头像化妆中的一致性和细节控制问题，为个性化定制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

*Wei Li,Jingyang Zhang,Lihao Liu,Guoan Wang,Junjun He,Yang Chen,Lixu Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自由形式的测试时间适应（F²TTA）任务，针对医疗数据中域片段随机到达的问题，提出了图像级解耦提示调优（I-DiPT）框架，结合不确定性导向掩码（UoM）和平行图蒸馏（PGD）方法，显著提升了模型在乳腺癌和青光眼分类中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据标注成本高，且数据通常以随机顺序和长度到达，现有TTA方法无法有效处理这种自由形式的域片段。

Method: 提出I-DiPT框架，使用图像不变提示和图像特定提示，结合UoM和PGD方法优化知识提取和历史知识重用。

Result: 在乳腺癌和青光眼分类任务中，该方法优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: I-DiPT框架有效解决了自由形式域片段中的适应问题，为医疗领域的TTA提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet是一种零样本增强方法，无需配对数据或先验知识，通过分解和去噪模块恢复低曝光图像，显著提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖配对数据且可能导致过增强，IGDNet旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合分解模块（分离光照和反射）与去噪模块（光照引导校正），通过迭代优化生成最终结果。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上表现优异，PSNR（20.41dB）和SSIM（0.860dB）优于14种无监督方法。

Conclusion: IGDNet在复杂光照条件下具有强泛化能力，且无需训练数据。

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: WeCoL为红外小目标检测提供了一种高效的弱监督解决方案，显著降低标注成本，性能接近全监督方法。

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

Motivation: 现有多行人跟踪数据集场景简单且非真实，难以支持复杂场景下的算法开发。

Result: 数据集为复杂场景下的算法开发提供了平台，并测试了多种先进模型的表现。

Conclusion: CrowdTrack数据集填补了现有数据集的不足，为复杂场景下的多行人跟踪研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Conclusion: MedFormer为医学图像识别提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

Result: 实验表明，该方法将碎片化率降低了2.2倍，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 时间感知在息肉计数中至关重要，该方法为息肉计数设立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明MC-INR在科学数据编码任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MC-INR通过灵活的结构设计和动态优化，显著提升了多变量和非结构化数据的编码能力。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling

fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP

Motivation: 现有方法（如MoGe）只能预测未知尺度的仿射不变点图，无法满足度量几何的需求。同时，真实数据中的噪声和误差会降低几何细节的恢复效果。

Conclusion: MoGe-2首次同时实现了高精度的相对几何、度量尺度和细节恢复，为单图像几何估计提供了新突破。

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

Conclusion: 该方法能够从复杂环境中准确估计交互动作，为未来姿态估计和行为理解研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

Result: 实验证明，该方法能准确捕捉复杂血管的几何形状，如主动脉、动脉瘤和脑血管。

Conclusion: 该框架成功统一了三种表示方法，实现了高保真度的血管建模。

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$S^2DC$的自监督学习框架，通过结构感知的语义差异和一致性学习，解决了3D医学图像中解剖结构变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定大小的图像块划分，忽略了医学图像中解剖结构的位置、尺度和形态变化，导致学习到的表征缺乏结构感知能力。

Method: $S^2DC$框架分两步：1）利用最优传输策略增强不同图像块的语义差异；2）基于邻域相似性分布提升结构级别的语义一致性。

Result: 在10个数据集、4个任务和3种模态上的实验表明，$S^2DC$显著优于现有自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: $S^2DC$通过结构感知的表征学习，为3D医学图像分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

TL;DR: AuroraLong提出了一种线性RNN语言模型，以解决长视频理解中的计算和内存问题，性能接近基于Transformer的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频理解中因Transformer的高计算复杂性和内存需求带来的挑战。

Method: 用线性RNN语言模型替代LLM，结合视觉令牌合并和排序，以恒定大小的隐藏状态处理任意长度输入。

Result: AuroraLong在多个视频基准测试中表现接近基于Transformer的模型，且仅需2B参数和公开数据训练。

Conclusion: 线性RNN有望降低长视频理解的计算门槛，推动其普及。

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Result: AIGI-Holmes模型在三个基准测试中表现优异，具备泛化能力和可验证解释。

Conclusion: Holmes-Set和Holmes Pipeline有效提升了AI生成图像检测的可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在精度和计算效率上优于现有技术，同时保持了灵活性。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型在计算成像中的应用提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在有限数据下过拟合、知识丢失和文本对齐退化的问题。

Method: APT包含自适应训练调整、表示稳定化和注意力对齐三个组件。

Conclusion: APT在有限数据下表现优于现有方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

TL;DR: CanonSwap提出了一种新的视频人脸交换框架，通过解耦面部外观和运动信息，解决了现有方法在保留目标脸动态属性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频人脸交换中难以同时实现高质量的身份转移和目标脸动态属性的准确保留，导致结果不一致。

Method: CanonSwap通过解耦运动与外观信息，在统一规范空间进行身份修改，再将其重新整合到原始视频空间。此外，设计了部分身份调制模块和细粒度同步指标。

Result: 实验表明，CanonSwap在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保留方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CanonSwap有效解决了视频人脸交换中的关键挑战，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

Result: 实验表明SIU3R在3D重建、理解及两者同时任务上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SIU3R的无对齐框架和协作设计有效提升了3D理解与重建的性能。

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Motivation: 现有关键点引导的文本到图像扩散模型在生成非刚性物体（如动物）和重叠对象时存在局限性，主要由于方法本身的限制和缺乏合适的数据集。

Conclusion: UniMC和HAIG-2.9M为关键点引导的图像生成提供了更通用的解决方案，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持整体生成质量的同时，显著提升了局部细节的生成效果。

Conclusion: FairHuman通过多目标优化有效提升了人像生成的局部细节质量，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Result: 在图像分类和Darcy流任务中，MANO性能媲美ViT和Swin Transformer，同时显著降低运行时和内存占用。

Conclusion: MANO通过线性复杂度设计，为高分辨率输入的高效处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

Motivation: 解决定向目标检测中高标注成本问题。

Method: 提出PWOOD框架、OS-Student模型和CPF策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于传统半监督算法。

Conclusion: PWOOD为定向目标检测提供了一种低成本高效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Conclusion: 该方法通过灵活的特征注入和优化策略，实现了无需训练的高质量图像生成。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过语义先验和参考图像，实现了高效且自动的对象分割，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

Conclusion: LangScene-X为稀疏视图下的3D重建和开放词汇场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR框架有效解决了多模态HAR系统中的关键问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: USAD方法有效解决了HAR的关键问题，显著提升了性能，并具备实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模态的安全漏洞研究主要将视觉作为触发不安全行为的工具，缺乏现实场景的语义基础。本文旨在定义一种视觉中心越狱攻击，使视觉信息成为构建完整越狱场景的必要组成部分。

Method: 提出VisCo攻击方法，通过四种视觉策略构建上下文对话，动态生成辅助图像，并结合自动毒性混淆和语义优化生成最终攻击提示。

Result: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上对GPT-4o的毒性评分为4.78，攻击成功率为85%，显著优于基线方法（毒性2.48，攻击成功率22.2%）。

Conclusion: VisCo攻击方法在视觉中心越狱场景中表现出色，为MLLMs的安全漏洞研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

Motivation: 现有文本到视频（T2V）和图像到视频（I2V）方法在动态运动信号和空间约束整合方面存在不足，T2V缺乏精确空间控制，I2V依赖真实图像限制编辑性。

Method: 提出AnyI2V框架，支持多种模态条件图像（如网格和点云），无需训练，支持混合输入和风格编辑。

Result: 实验表明AnyI2V在空间和运动控制视频生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: AnyI2V为视频生成提供了新的视角，支持更灵活和多样化的应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

Result: 在五种专业视觉任务中，GCoT显著优于微调和蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: GCoT能有效提升MLLM在数据受限场景下的适应能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

Conclusion: EasyCache为高质量视频生成提供了高效且易用的解决方案，适用于研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

Conclusion: RefTok通过有效捕捉时间动态和上下文信息，显著提升了视频模型的性能。

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

Conclusion: Point3R通过显式指针内存和高效融合机制，实现了高性能的密集流式3D重建。

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

Conclusion: LDSolver为流体流动模拟提供了一种高效、准确且通用的方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为通用无校准运动想象分类设定了新基准，并贡献了开源数据集。

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体在选举和危机期间充斥虚假信息，现有研究多关注单模态（文本或图像），而多模态特征组合的研究较少。

Method: 采用早期融合方法，结合文本、图像和社交特征，分析1,529条推文，并通过数据增强提取视觉和社交特征。

Result: 多模态模型比单模态模型性能提升15%，比双模态模型提升5%，并分析了虚假信息的传播模式。

Conclusion: 多模态特征组合能更有效地检测虚假信息，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

Conclusion: 该方法能在个人计算机上高效选择高区分能力的特征子集，并提前估计区分能力的下限。

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器学习的多变量时间序列（MTS）异常检测方法，通过连续小波变换（CWT）将数据转换为图像表示，并利用微调的VGG-16架构和Siamese网络进行高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造过程复杂，数据高维且存在噪声、类别不平衡等问题，传统方法难以有效检测异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为半导体制造中的异常检测提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Temporal Chain of Thought”的推理策略，通过迭代选择视频中最相关的帧来提升长视频问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）能处理约1000帧输入，但在长视频理解中仍难以有效利用上下文，且易受无关干扰影响。

Method: 利用VLM自身迭代识别并提取视频中最相关的帧，用于回答问题。

Result: 在4个不同的视频问答数据集上取得最佳效果，尤其在超过1小时的长视频上表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过推理时选择最相关上下文，显著提升了长视频问答的准确性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AIRES的算法-系统协同设计解决方案，用于加速图卷积网络（GCNs）中的稀疏通用矩阵乘法（SpGEMM）计算，解决了现有系统中的数据对齐和内存分配性能瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图数据规模的不断扩大，现有的SpGEMM计算系统在资源受限的环境中面临高I/O延迟和GPU利用率不足的问题。

Method: AIRES通过算法层面的块级数据对齐优化和系统层面的三阶段动态调度策略，结合GPU内存、GPU Direct Storage（GDS）和主机内存的多层次存储系统，提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，AIRES在真实图处理基准测试中显著优于现有方法，延迟降低了1.8倍。

Conclusion: AIRES通过算法与系统的协同优化，有效解决了SpGEMM计算中的性能瓶颈，为大规模图处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

to determine the optimal datapoints to sample, and that the approach helps
under a constrained number of samples.

Motivation: 现有几何扩散模型在下游任务中高效微调的能力不足，尤其是在几何控制多样化的情况下。

Method: 提出SE(3)-等变适配器框架GeoAda，通过轻量级适配器模块实现参数高效微调，同时保持几何一致性。

Result: GeoAda在多种几何控制任务中表现优异，保持原始任务准确性，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GeoAda为几何扩散模型提供了一种灵活且高效的微调方法，适用于广泛的几何控制任务。

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded

Motivation: 研究旨在评估LLM在招聘中的准确性和公平性，揭示其潜在偏见，并展示专有模型如何更好地平衡准确性与公平性。

Method: 通过实验比较多个LLM与Match Score的预测准确性（如ROC AUC）和公平性（如影响比率），使用10,000个真实招聘数据。

Result: Match Score在准确性（ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77）和公平性（种族影响比率0.957 vs 0.809）上均优于LLM。

Conclusion: 专有模型能更有效减少偏见，强调在高风险领域需结合领域特定建模和偏见审计，避免直接使用通用LLM。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

Result: EBTs在训练和推理中表现优于Transformer++和Diffusion Transformers，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: EBTs是一种有前景的新范式，可扩展模型的学习和思考能力。

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Conclusion: 超坍缩现象为模型缩放提供了精确的实用指标，并通过简单的SGD噪声动力学模型解释了其起源。

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power

Result: 实验表明，该方法在相同重建误差下，压缩比优于SZ3等规则方法10倍，性能比学习型方法高63%。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少存储成本的同时实现了高精度的时空重建，为数据压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

Result: 定量实验表明，该方法提高了DR评估的稳定性，减少了评估偏见。

Conclusion: 该工作流程有效减少了维度降维评估中的偏见，提升了评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

Result: 在三种PDE系统中，预测误差减少高达100倍，推理时间增加不到5%。

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect将不稳定的神经网络代理转化为可靠的模拟工具，平衡了计算效率与物理保真度。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

Motivation: 当前机器学习领域存在大量性能相似但行为不同的模型，手动比较和文档化成本过高。

Method: 利用LLM采样生成模型差异的文本描述，并通过模拟评估其信息量。

Result: VERBA在决策树模型上能准确描述差异（80%准确率），结合结构信息后提升至90%。

Conclusion: VERBA为模型透明度和可比性提供了新方法。

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques

networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for
future research endeavors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励函数设计方法效率低且不一致，现有LLMs在数值优化上表现不佳，进化搜索范式资源利用低效。

Method: 提出URDP框架，通过自一致性分析量化奖励函数不确定性，引入UABO优化超参数配置，并采用双层优化架构。

Result: 在35个任务上验证，URDP生成更高质量的奖励函数，且设计效率显著提升。

Conclusion: URDP通过结合LLMs的逻辑推理和贝叶斯优化的数值优化能力，解决了奖励函数设计的核心挑战。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的补贴策略框架FCA-RL，用于动态适应竞争对手的价格调整，优化订单获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网约车聚合平台的竞争排名机制促使服务提供商采用优惠券策略以增加订单量，但现有研究较少。

Method: 结合快速竞争适应（FCA）和强化拉格朗日调整（RLA），并开发了RideGym模拟环境。

Result: 实验表明FCA-RL在多种市场条件下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FCA-RL框架能有效优化网约车服务提供商的补贴策略。

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

Result: 在APY数据集上，KGZS-SC网络表现出强大的泛化能力，在不同信噪比下显著优于现有框架。

Conclusion: KGZS-SC网络通过知识图谱和零样本学习，有效提升了语义通信的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AMR的轻量级方法，用于动态数据流中的持续学习，通过选择性更新记忆缓冲区来应对概念漂移，性能接近完全重新学习但成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习方法假设数据分布静态，忽视了真实世界中数据流的动态性（如概念漂移），需要同时保持稳定性和快速适应性。

Method: 提出AMR方法，选择性移除过时的样本并补充少量新样本，以轻量级方式对齐新分布；同时设计了四个概念漂移变体的标准视觉基准数据集。

Result: AMR在多个数据集上表现优异，接近完全重新学习的性能，但显著减少了标注和计算开销。

Conclusion: AMR是一种可扩展的解决方案，能在非静态环境中平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Result: 自蒸馏显著提升了生成质量。

Conclusion: 迭代自蒸馏是解决约束文本生成中稀疏奖励问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床环境中，了解患者风险演变的原因对及时干预至关重要，但现有XAI方法无法满足临床时间序列解释的特殊要求。

Result: 在在线患者监测任务中，DeltaSHAP在解释质量上优于现有XAI方法62%，计算效率提升33%。

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP为临床时间序列解释提供了一种高效、实用的解决方案，适用于时间敏感的临床应用。

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

Result: PANI与多种离线强化学习算法兼容，并在多个基准测试中表现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PANI提供了一种简单高效的方法，无需复杂模型即可提升离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global

TL;DR: InfinityKAN通过变分推断优化自适应学习无限基函数，扩展了Kolmogorov Arnold Networks（KANs）的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs的理论基础强大，但作为多层感知机（MLP）的替代方案时，其性能依赖于基函数数量的选择，这一问题尚未解决。

Method: 将问题建模为变分推断优化问题，通过反向传播自适应学习无限基函数。

Result: 提出的InfinityKAN方法能够动态调整基函数数量，提升了KANs的灵活性和适用性。

Conclusion: InfinityKAN为KANs的实际应用提供了更优的解决方案，解决了基函数数量选择的难题。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

TL;DR: 论文研究了一种在线框架下的共形预测问题，直接优化效率。目标是覆盖目标错误率α，同时最小化区间长度。在可交换序列中，算法能接近最优；在任意序列中，存在效率与错误率的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线共形预测问题，旨在在保证覆盖率的同时优化预测区间的效率，填补了在线学习与共形预测之间的空白。

Method: 针对可交换和任意输入序列，分别设计算法。可交换序列中，算法接近最优；任意序列中，算法需权衡效率与错误率。

Result: 可交换序列中，算法接近最优覆盖率且区间长度有界；任意序列中，算法需在效率与错误率间权衡。

Conclusion: 在线共形预测在可交换与任意序列中存在性能差异，需设计不同算法。论文提出的算法在两种情况下均表现良好。

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

TL;DR: GORP（Gradient LOw Rank Projection）是一种新的训练策略，通过结合全参数和低秩参数，在统一低秩梯度子空间中联合更新，解决了LLMs持续微调中效率与表达能力的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低秩适应（LoRA）在持续学习中的局限性，即效率高但学习新任务和知识迁移能力受限。

Method: 结合全参数和低秩参数，在统一低秩梯度子空间中联合更新，扩展优化空间并保持效率。

Result: 在持续学习基准测试中表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: GORP是一种高效且表达能力强的持续学习策略，有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is
available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RetrySQL是一种新的文本到SQL生成模型训练方法，通过引入自我纠正机制，显著提升了执行准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL任务的研究多依赖于黑盒语言模型，缺乏针对SQL的生成模型研究，且自我纠正策略的应用尚未探索。

Method: 通过准备参考SQL查询的推理步骤并故意引入错误，生成包含纠正步骤的“重试数据”，并基于开源编码模型进行持续预训练。

Result: 使用重试数据预训练使执行准确性提升高达4个百分点，且全参数预训练是必要的。

Conclusion: RetrySQL证明了自我纠正机制在文本到SQL任务中的有效性，为SQL导向的语言模型提供了新的改进方法。

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

TL;DR: 深度神经网络（DNNs）通过利用目标函数的组合稀疏结构取得成功，这种结构使得大多数实际相关函数可以由少量低维输入的子函数组合而成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨DNNs成功背后的基本原理，特别是其如何利用组合稀疏性来克服高维问题。

Method: 分析组合稀疏性在DNNs中的作用，并探讨其在可计算函数中的普遍性。

Result: 组合稀疏性是DNNs成功的关键，且适用于所有高效可计算函数。

Conclusion: 理解组合稀疏性对深度学习理论的完善至关重要，甚至可能对通用智能理论产生影响。

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

*Luca Baroni,Galvin Khara,Joachim Schaeffer,Marat Subkhankulov,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，层归一化（LN）在GPT-2模型中并非不可或缺，移除后仅小幅增加验证损失，且不影响语言建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨层归一化在推理阶段的作用及其对模型可解释性的影响。

Method: 移除GPT-2模型中的所有LN层，并评估验证损失、微调数据需求及可解释性技术的表现。

Result: 移除LN层仅导致验证损失小幅增加（如GPT-2 XL增加0.03交叉熵损失），且微调数据需求随模型参数增长呈次线性关系。

Conclusion: LN层在语言建模中作用有限，移除后模型仍能有效运行，为可解释性研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

Motivation: 解决DBNs在输入宽度增加时参数数量增长的问题，同时优化模型压缩与准确性的权衡。

Method: 引入可微互联结构，并采用基于SAT的逻辑等价剪枝和基于相似性的数据驱动剪枝。

Result: 扩展后的DBNs能处理更宽的输入层，剪枝方法在压缩模型大小的同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了DBNs的可扩展性和效率，同时优化了压缩与准确性的平衡。

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

Motivation: 扩散模型在推理时的高计算成本限制了其作为快速物理仿真器的应用，研究旨在探索潜在空间仿真是否能解决这一问题。

Method: 通过在自动编码器的潜在空间中生成仿真数据，而非像素空间，研究了不同压缩率下的性能表现，并比较了扩散模型与非生成模型的准确性。

Result: 潜在空间仿真的准确性对高达1000倍的压缩率表现出惊人的鲁棒性，扩散模型比非生成模型更准确且预测多样性更强。

Conclusion: 潜在空间扩散模型在动态系统仿真中具有高效性和准确性，同时提供了实用的设计选择建议。

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-VAE是一种可学习的变分自编码器，通过动态调整损失函数的权重和模型参数，解决了β-VAE中超参数固定的问题，实现了更好的解耦和重建平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: β-VAE中超参数η需要手动调整，限制了其灵活性。L-VAE旨在通过学习损失函数的权重和模型参数，动态平衡解耦和重建损失。

Method: L-VAE通过同时学习损失项的权重和模型架构参数，并添加正则化项防止偏向某一损失，优化解耦和重建的平衡。

Result: 实验表明，L-VAE在多个数据集上表现优异，平衡了解耦和重建性能，且在CelebA数据集上成功解耦面部属性。

Conclusion: L-VAE通过动态学习机制，显著提升了变分自编码器在解耦和重建任务中的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于多序列比对（MSA）的方法假设自然变体适应性强，但某些药物基因的低进化压力挑战了这一假设，DMS数据集提供了替代方案。

Method: 使用matVAE-MSA模型，结合结构化先验，并在33个DMS数据集上评估性能。还比较了基于DMS训练的matENC-DMS模型，并探索了AlphaFold结构信息的整合。

Result: matVAE-MSA在零样本预测中优于DeepSequence，且参数和计算需求更低。结合AlphaFold结构后，性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: DMS数据集有望替代MSA，未来需进一步开发DMS数据集并探索其关系以提升变体效应预测。

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）数据质量参差不齐，影响流行病学研究和人工智能训练的可靠性，现有评估方法不足。

Method: 采用软件工程中的单元测试和覆盖率概念，开发了MDPT工具，包括自动化测试生成器和数据测试框架。

Result: 在三个数据集上测试，MDPT生成了55-73个测试，识别出20-43个数据问题，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合外部医学知识，提升了数据质量测试的上下文敏感性，为未来改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

Result: PTS-BE在稀疏奖励和纯探索任务中显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 本文为基于信息增益的方法提供了理论支持，并通过PTS-BE框架实现了高效的深度探索。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

Conclusion: DAID通过因果分析有效解决了公平性与泛化性的冲突，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于离散扩散模型的抗体序列优化框架，结合SVDD模块提升可开发性预测，用于设计满足结合和生物物理标准的抗体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床有效的治疗性抗体需要高亲和力、良好的可制造性、稳定性和安全性，这些特性统称为可开发性。论文旨在通过计算方法优化抗体序列以实现更好的可开发性。

Method: 引入了一种基于自然抗体序列和临床抗体数据的离散扩散模型，结合SVDD模块引导生成生物物理可行的候选序列。

Result: 模型在无约束采样中重现了自然抗体库和已批准治疗抗体的特征，SVDD引导显著提升了可开发性预测得分。

Conclusion: 该框架结合高通量实验，可实现迭代的机器学习驱动抗体设计，同时满足结合和生物物理标准。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于差分隐私生成模型的数据共享方法，通过联合训练差分隐私条件变分自编码器（DP-CVAE）解决医学影像数据稀缺和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像中应用受限，主要因数据稀缺和隐私法规，联邦学习存在通信成本高和任务单一的问题。

Method: 采用基础模型提取紧凑嵌入，联合训练差分隐私条件变分自编码器（DP-CVAE），建模全局隐私感知数据分布。

Result: 方法在隐私、可扩展性和效率上优于传统联邦学习分类器，且DP-CVAE比DP-CGAN生成更高保真嵌入，参数减少5倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了医学影像数据共享的隐私和效率问题，支持多样化下游任务。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

*Thomas Hazenberg,Yao Ma,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Marijn van Rijswijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多智能体强化学习（MARL）如何改进供应链中的动态定价策略，填补了传统ERP系统静态规则方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ERP系统依赖静态规则，忽略了市场参与者间的战略互动，而单智能体强化学习未能模拟真实供应链的相互依赖性。

Method: 评估了三种MARL算法（MADDPG、MADQN、QMIX）与静态规则基线的性能，使用真实电商交易数据和LightGBM需求预测模型进行模拟。

Result: 规则代理在公平性和价格稳定性上表现最佳，但缺乏竞争动态；MADQN定价最激进，MADDPG在竞争与公平间取得平衡。

Conclusion: MARL能捕捉静态规则无法模拟的战略行为，为动态定价的未来发展提供参考。

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于共识的联邦学习协议（FedVRD），通过动态限制对手影响并优化数据传输成本，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习机制中，所有客户端无论权重是否有用都需要传输数据，导致资源浪费。本文旨在减少无效数据传输并提升模型性能。

Method: 提出了一种新的流体民主协议（viscous-retained democracy），并开发了FedVRD算法，动态限制对手影响，同时优化成本。

Result: 新协议在相同假设下优于传统1p1v方法，且能防止影响力积累。FedVRD算法有效减少了对手对全局模型的负面影响。

Conclusion: FedVRD协议在联邦学习中显著提升了效率和安全性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法存在早期经验过拟合问题（primacy bias），而人类因婴儿期遗忘机制不易受此影响。受此启发，提出FoG算法。

Method: 1. 经验回放衰减（ER Decay）逐步减少早期经验的影响；2. 网络扩展动态增加参数以增强模型能力。

Result: 在40多个任务的连续控制基准测试中，FoG表现优于现有SoTA算法（如BRO、SimBa、TD-MPC2）。

Conclusion: FoG通过模仿神经科学的遗忘与生长机制，显著提升了深度强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Motivation: 无桩电动滑板车作为环保灵活的交通工具，需求预测对其管理至关重要，但现有研究未能综合多维度因素。

Method: 提出了一种整合空间、时间和网络依赖性的框架，用于需求预测。

Result: 框架将需求预测准确性提高了27%至49%。

Conclusion: 该框架支持数据驱动的微出行管理，优化车队分布和城市规划。

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

Motivation: 解决蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用（PPI）预测中数据异质性和稀疏性问题，尤其是在跨物种和低数据条件下的预测挑战。

Method: 提出分层对比学习框架HIPPO，结合蛋白质序列和层次属性，通过多层次的生物表示匹配和分层对比损失函数，利用数据驱动的惩罚机制整合领域和家族知识。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在低数据条件下表现出鲁棒性，并展示了强大的零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: HIPPO为跨物种PPI预测提供了统一框架，特别适用于数据稀疏或不平衡的多物种场景，同时揭示了分层特征融合对捕捉保守相互作用决定因素的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类问题是机器学习的核心问题之一，传统方法如支持向量机和梯度下降存在局限性，需要更鲁棒和通用的解决方案。

Method: 通过在有界超立方体中搜索参数向量，并最小化熵函数，扩展到多项式曲面以实现复杂决策边界。

Result: 数值实验表明该方法在处理线性和非线性可分任务时高效且通用。

Conclusion: 该方法为分类问题提供了鲁棒的替代方案，优于传统线性或二次优化技术。

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型依赖海量数据，但传统扩展定律假设无限数据且计算受限，实际中token效率成为关键。

Method: 提出2-simplicial Transformer，将标准点积注意力推广为三线性函数，并通过Triton内核高效实现。

Result: 在相同token预算下，2-simplicial Transformer在数学、编码等任务上表现优于标准Transformer，并改变了知识推理任务的扩展定律指数。

Conclusion: 2-simplicial Transformer通过提升token效率，为计算非受限场景下的模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

Conclusion: 该研究为带有偏置离线数据的上下文定价问题提供了首个紧密的遗憾保证，并适用于随机线性老虎机问题。

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

Motivation: 循环模型（如状态空间模型和线性注意力）因其线性复杂度而流行，但在超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，即无法长度泛化。本文旨在分析原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过实证和理论分析支持“未探索状态假设”，并提出训练干预方法（如高斯噪声初始化或使用其他序列的最终状态初始化）以增加状态覆盖。

Result: 仅需500次后训练步骤（约0.1%的预训练预算），干预方法可将长度泛化能力从2k提升至128k，并在长上下文任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 简单的训练干预能高效提升循环模型的长度泛化能力，为实际应用提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

Result: 理论证明优化方法可行且接近最优，实证显示GRADUATE优于现有基线。

Conclusion: GRADUATE有效解决了少数子群体校准问题，提升了生存模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

Conclusion: ExPO通过生成高质量样本，有效解决了强化学习后训练中的探索问题，提升了模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in

*Kunyu Zhang,Qiang Li,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MvHo-IB是一种多视图学习框架，通过整合高阶相互作用（HOIs）和成对相互作用，提升fMRI数据的诊断准确性，并自动压缩冗余信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提取和利用高阶相互作用（HOIs）方面存在挑战，限制了fMRI数据的诊断准确性。

Method: 结合信息论中的O-information和Renyi熵估计器量化HOIs，使用Brain3DCNN编码器，并采用多视图学习信息瓶颈目标。

Result: 在三个fMRI基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，包括最新的超图技术。

Conclusion: MvHo-IB通过创新方法显著提升了fMRI数据的诊断性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is
available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的质量-多样性（QD）框架，用于动态调度问题，通过构建映射策略可视化解空间，并展示其在动态环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界优化需要多样且高质量的解决方案，而QD算法在动态组合优化问题中的应用和理论理解尚不充分。

Method: 提出了一种映射构建策略，将启发式基因型与其行为链接，并在QD映射上表示，以发现和维护多样化的调度启发式。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能在固定和动态变化的训练实例中有效演化映射和解分布。

Conclusion: 该研究为QD算法在动态组合优化中的应用提供了新思路，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Real-world optimization often demands diverse, high-quality solutions.
Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is a multifaceted approach in evolutionary
algorithms that aims to generate a set of solutions that are both
high-performing and diverse. QD algorithms have been successfully applied
across various domains, providing robust solutions by exploring diverse
behavioral niches. However, their application has primarily focused on static
problems, with limited exploration in the context of dynamic combinatorial
optimization problems. Furthermore, the theoretical understanding of QD
algorithms remains underdeveloped, particularly when applied to learning
heuristics instead of directly learning solutions in complex and dynamic
combinatorial optimization domains, which introduces additional challenges.
This paper introduces a novel QD framework for dynamic scheduling problems. We
propose a map-building strategy that visualizes the solution space by linking
heuristic genotypes to their behaviors, enabling their representation on a QD
map. This map facilitates the discovery and maintenance of diverse scheduling
heuristics. Additionally, we conduct experiments on both fixed and dynamically
changing training instances to demonstrate how the map evolves and how the
distribution of solutions unfolds over time. We also discuss potential future
research directions that could enhance the learning process and broaden the
applicability of QD algorithms to dynamic combinatorial optimization
challenges.

Motivation: 探究算法配置与问题特征之间的相互作用，以提升算法性能的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 计算六种modCMA变体在24个BBOB基准问题上的性能足迹，分析5维和30维设置下的表现。

Result: 发现不同配置因问题特征差异表现不同，同时揭示了共享行为模式和独特行为模式。

Conclusion: 算法足迹能有效提升算法性能的透明度和指导配置选择。

Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints
to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem
characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants
of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the
BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional.
These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same
algorithm exhibit varying performance and identify the problem features
influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns
across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem
features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in
enhancing interpretability and guiding configuration choices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可视化方法在高维或复杂解空间中难以展示搜索过程的结构动态，需要更直观的方法。

Method: 聚类算法探索的候选解，跟踪聚类成员在迭代中的变化，并引入稳定性与相似性指标。

Result: 应用于十种数值元启发式算法，揭示了其稳定性和比较行为。

Conclusion: 新方法提供了对算法搜索动态的更深入理解。

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms
is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional
visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and
fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex
solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and
visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种实验性方法，用于估计多目标进化算法（MOEAs）在数值优化中的运行时间上限，无需简化假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖算法或问题简化，限制了其在现实场景中的适用性，因此需要一种无需简化的运行时间分析方法。

Method: 采用平均增益模型和自适应采样方法，结合统计方法估计增益的概率分布，动态调整采样密度以准确拟合运行时间。

Result: 在五种代表性MOEAs上的实验表明，该方法能有效估计运行时间上限，无需简化假设。

Conclusion: 该方法为数值优化中MOEAs的理论研究提供了实用补充，并通过网页实现促进广泛采用。

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become essential tools
for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), making their running
time analysis crucial for assessing algorithmic efficiency and guiding
practical applications. While significant theoretical advances have been
achieved for combinatorial optimization, existing studies for numerical
optimization primarily rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, limiting
their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose an
experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of MOEAs
in numerical optimization without simplification assumptions. Our approach
employs an average gain model that characterizes algorithmic progress through
the Inverted Generational Distance metric. To handle the stochastic nature of
MOEAs, we use statistical methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of
gains. Recognizing that gain distributions in numerical optimization exhibit
irregular patterns with varying densities across different regions, we
introduce an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts sampling density
to ensure accurate surface fitting for running time estimation. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on five representative MOEAs (NSGA-II, MOEA/D,
AR-MOEA, AGEMOEA-II, and PREA) using the ZDT and DTLZ benchmark suites. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating upper
bounds on the running time without requiring algorithmic or problem
simplifications. Additionally, we provide a web-based implementation to
facilitate broader adoption of our methodology. This work provides a practical
complement to theoretical research on MOEAs in numerical optimization.

Motivation: 进化组合优化的运行时间分析在进化计算中是一个基础课题，但相关理论结果较少。

Method: 提出多增益模型，改进平均增益模型，适用于平均和最坏情况下的首次命中时间估计。

Result: 为背包问题、k-MAX-SAT问题和旅行商问题提供了更紧的时间复杂度上界，实验验证了模型有效性。

Conclusion: 多增益模型是分析组合优化问题进化算法运行时间的有效工具。

Abstract: The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a
fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. However, theoretical results
regarding the $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm (EA) for combinatorial
optimization problems remain relatively scarce compared to those for simple
pseudo-Boolean problems. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to analyze
the running time of EAs for combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed
model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is a
fitness-difference drift approach under the sigma-algebra condition to estimate
the running time of evolutionary numerical optimization. The improvement yields
a framework for estimating the expected first hitting time of a stochastic
process in both average-case and worst-case scenarios. It also introduces novel
running-time results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including two
tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights,
a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems and a tighter time
complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$)
EA for the traveling salesperson problem. Experimental results indicate that
the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that
the multiple-gain model is an effective tool for running-time analysis of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for combinatorial optimization problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缓和医疗中有效沟通的培训资源有限，PAL旨在提供低成本、可重复的练习工具。

Method: PAL支持文本和语音交互，基于共情框架提供反馈。通过17名美国医学生和临床医生的混合方法研究评估其可用性和用户参与度。

Result: 用户认为PAL有助于反思和技能提升，但情感真实性和反馈适应性存在局限。

Conclusion: PAL证明大语言模型可用于缓和医疗培训，并为情感敏感型模拟工具设计提供了启示。

Abstract: Effective communication in serious illness and palliative care is essential
but often under-taught due to limited access to training resources like
standardized patients. We present PAL (Palliative Assisted Learning-bot), a
conversational system that simulates emotionally nuanced patient interactions
and delivers structured feedback grounded in an existing empathy-based
framework. PAL supports text and voice modalities and is designed to scaffold
clinical skill-building through repeated, low-cost practice. Through a
mixed-methods study with 17 U.S. medical trainees and clinicians, we explore
user engagement with PAL, evaluate usability, and examine design tensions
around modalities, emotional realism, and feedback delivery. Participants found
PAL helpful for reflection and skill refinement, though some noted limitations
in emotional authenticity and the adaptability of feedback. We contribute: (1)
empirical evidence that large language models can support palliative
communication training; (2) design insights for modality-aware, emotionally
sensitive simulation tools; and (3) implications for systems that support
emotional labor, cooperative learning, and AI-augmented training in high-stakes
care settings.

Abstract: Large language Models have only been widely available since 2022 and yet in
less than three years have had a significant impact on approaches to education
and educational technology. Here we review the domains in which they have been
used, and discuss a variety of use cases, their successes and failures. We then
progress to discussing how this is changing the dynamic for learners and
educators, consider the main design challenges facing LLMs if they are to
become truly helpful and effective as educational systems, and reflect on the
learning paradigms they support. We make clear that the new interaction
paradigms they bring are significant and argue that this approach will become
so ubiquitous it will become the default way in which we interact with
technologies, and revolutionise what people expect from computer systems in
general. This leads us to present some specific and significant considerations
for the design of educational technology in the future that are likely to be
needed to ensure acceptance by the changing expectations of learners and users.

Result: 系统已在组织内部部署，拥有数百用户，并贡献了提示链方法到UNITXT开源库。

Conclusion: EvalAssist有效简化了LLM评估流程，提升了效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: With the broad availability of large language models and their ability to
generate vast outputs using varied prompts and configurations, determining the
best output for a given task requires an intensive evaluation process, one
where machine learning practitioners must decide how to assess the outputs and
then carefully carry out the evaluation. This process is both time-consuming
and costly. As practitioners work with an increasing number of models, they
must now evaluate outputs to determine which model and prompt performs best for
a given task. LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators to filter training data,
evaluate model performance, assess harms and risks, or assist human evaluators
with detailed assessments. We present EvalAssist, a framework that simplifies
the LLM-as-a-judge workflow. The system provides an online criteria development
environment, where users can interactively build, test, and share custom
evaluation criteria in a structured and portable format. We support a set of
LLM-based evaluation pipelines that leverage off-the-shelf LLMs and use a
prompt-chaining approach we developed and contributed to the UNITXT open-source
library. Additionally, our system also includes specially trained evaluators to
detect harms and risks in LLM outputs. We have deployed the system internally
in our organization with several hundreds of users.

Abstract: This paper examines a critical yet unexplored dimension of the AI alignment
problem: the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to inherit and amplify
existing misalignments between human espoused theories and theories-in-use.
Drawing on action science research, we argue that LLMs trained on
human-generated text likely absorb and reproduce Model 1 theories-in-use - a
defensive reasoning pattern that both inhibits learning and creates ongoing
anti-learning dynamics at the dyad, group, and organisational levels. Through a
detailed case study of an LLM acting as an HR consultant, we show how its
advice, while superficially professional, systematically reinforces
unproductive problem-solving approaches and blocks pathways to deeper
organisational learning. This represents a specific instance of the alignment
problem where the AI system successfully mirrors human behaviour but inherits
our cognitive blind spots. This poses particular risks if LLMs are integrated
into organisational decision-making processes, potentially entrenching
anti-learning practices while lending authority to them. The paper concludes by
exploring the possibility of developing LLMs capable of facilitating Model 2
learning - a more productive theory-in-use - and suggests this effort could
advance both AI alignment research and action science practice. This analysis
reveals an unexpected symmetry in the alignment challenge: the process of
developing AI systems properly aligned with human values could yield tools that
help humans themselves better embody those same values.

Abstract: Human-centered explainability has become a critical foundation for the
responsible development of interactive information systems, where users must be
able to understand, interpret, and scrutinize AI-driven outputs to make
informed decisions. This systematic survey of literature aims to characterize
recent progress in user studies on explainability in interactive information
systems by reviewing how explainability has been conceptualized, designed, and
evaluated in practice. Following PRISMA guidelines, eight academic databases
were searched, and 100 relevant articles were identified. A structural encoding
approach was then utilized to extract and synthesize insights from these
articles. The main contributions include 1) five dimensions that researchers
have used to conceptualize explainability; 2) a classification scheme of
explanation designs; 3) a categorization of explainability measurements into
six user-centered dimensions. The review concludes by reflecting on ongoing
challenges and providing recommendations for future exploration of related
issues. The findings shed light on the theoretical foundations of
human-centered explainability, informing the design of interactive information
systems that better align with diverse user needs and promoting the development
of systems that are transparent, trustworthy, and accountable.

Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly,
requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a
method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to
analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations
to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our
evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the
performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human
evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent
performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting
potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation.
However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and
design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations.
Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed

TL;DR: 提出了一种细粒度标注方法，通过即时回忆范式解决传统视频情感生理数据集中粗粒度标注导致的标签噪声问题，并验证了其生理和识别性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频情感生理数据集采用粗粒度标注，与情感反应的动态性和局部性不符，导致标签噪声，限制了情感识别算法的评估和性能。

Method: 采用即时回忆范式，在初始刺激观看后加入即时视频回放阶段，参与者可精确标记起始时间戳、情感标签和强度。

Result: 生理验证显示参与者标记的窗口内有多模态信号变化，识别实验中细粒度标注模型的准确率比传统方法高9.7%。

Conclusion: 细粒度标注解决了标签噪声问题，并证明标注精度对情感识别性能的影响超过数据规模。

Abstract: Traditional video-induced emotion physiological datasets often use
whole-trial annotation, assigning a single emotion label to all data collected
during an entire trial. This coarse-grained annotation approach misaligns with
the dynamic and temporally localized nature of emotional responses as they
unfold with video narratives, introducing label noise that limits emotion
recognition algorithm evaluation and performance. To solve the label noise
problem caused by coarse-grained annotation, we propose a fine-grained
annotation method through an immediate recall paradigm. This paradigm
integrates an immediate video replay phase after the initial stimulus viewing,
allowing participants to precisely mark the onset timestamp, emotion label, and
intensity based on their immediate recall. We validate this paradigm through
physiological evidence and recognition performance. Physiological validation of
multimodal signals within participant-marked windows revealed rhythm-specific
EEG patterns and arousal-dependent GSR responses-with SCRs appearing in 91% of
high-arousal versus 6% of low-arousal emotion windows. These objective
physiological data changes strongly aligned with subjective annotations,
confirming annotation precision. For recognition performance, classification
experiments showed that models trained on fine-grained annotations achieved
9.7% higher accuracy than traditional whole-trial labeling, despite using less
data. This work not only addresses label noise through fine-grained annotation
but also demonstrates that annotation precision outweighs data scale in
determining emotion recognition performance.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过音乐化振动模式作为被动生物反馈干预手段，用于放松和睡眠启动的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种非侵入性的触觉反馈方法，替代传统的听觉或开环干预，以帮助放松和睡眠。

Method: 通过智能手表振动编码节奏结构，并调整频率略低于用户实时心率，利用触觉同步降低兴奋度。

Result: 短期刺激下副交感神经活动增加且主观放松感提升，但对睡眠启动阶段无显著影响。

Conclusion: 触觉反馈可支持放松，但需进一步优化设计以提升睡眠干预效果。

Abstract: We investigate the use of musically structured, closed-loop vibration
patterns as a passive biofeedback intervention for relaxation and sleep
initiation. By encoding rhythmic meter structures into smartwatch vibrations
and adapting their frequency to be slightly slower than the user's real-time
heart rate, our system aims to reduce arousal through tactile entrainment,
offering a non-invasive alternative to auditory or open-loop approaches
previously used in sleep and anxiety contexts. In the first study (N=20), we
compared five adaptive vibration rhythms for their effects on heart rate and
subjective perceptions of relaxation in a resting context. In the second study
(N=28), we evaluated the most promising pattern from Study 1 in a prolonged
sleep initiation setting. Results showed increased parasympathetic activity and
perceived relaxation during short-term stimulation, but no significant effects
on sleep-related measures during the sleep onset phase. This work contributes
to the understanding of how wearable haptic feedback can support relaxation and
sleep, offering design insights and identifying methodological considerations
for effectively integrating haptic interaction into self-directed
interventions.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于实时心率的触觉生物反馈在休息状态下的效果，比较了手腕、手、前臂和肩部四种佩戴位置。结果显示前臂和肩部最适合放松反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有触觉生物反馈应用多关注压力场景和固定振动模式，缺乏对身体位置和动态生物反馈的考虑。

Method: 研究通过实时心率调整触觉反馈，测量心率、耳部α波活动、主观休息感和振动体验。

Result: 手腕、肩部和前臂的生物反馈降低了心率，前臂和肩部主观休息感最佳且最受欢迎。

Conclusion: 前臂和肩部是理想的放松反馈位置，手腕设计需改进。

Abstract: Wearable haptic interventions offer promising support for relaxation through
slow, vibrotactile biofeedback. Despite their potential, current applications
focus on stress-inducing procedures and fixed vibration patterns, with limited
consideration of body location and dynamic biofeedback during restful states.
This study investigates the effects of haptic biofeedback adjusted from
real-time heart rate during eyes-closed wakeful rest, comparing four wearable
body placements: the wrist, hand, forearm, and shoulder. Heart rate, alpha wave
activity on the ear, subjective restfulness, and vibration experience were
measured across these conditions. Results show that biofeedback reduced heart
rate at the wrist, shoulder, and forearm, while alpha power measured at the ear
remained unchanged. Subjective restfulness was rated highest at the shoulder
and forearm, which were also the most preferred locations. In addition,
participants reported greater comfort, relaxation, and further increased
sleepiness at the forearm compared to the wrist, which was more easily
recognizable. These findings suggest that the forearm and shoulder are ideal
for unobtrusive relaxation feedback for wakeful rest, while the wrist may
require design improvements for subjective experience.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成情感丰富对话时的表现，发现情感建模需结合自动化和人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对话代理在日常互动中的普及，情感智能（尤其是共情倾听）的需求日益增长。

Method: 使用ChatGPT和Gemini扩展专家手工制作的小数据集，通过VADER情感分析和专家评估分析对话情感进展。

Result: 生成的对话虽能反映情感结构，但人类评估显示共情和连贯性存在差异。

Conclusion: 情感对话建模需结合结构对齐和情感深度，强调自动化与人工方法结合的重要性。

Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding
their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and
customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily
human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly
empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore
how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating
emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted
by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using
two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the
dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.
While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional
structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived
empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion
modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed
emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining
automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent
agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种低成本、无线的脚部追踪器，用于CAVE显示系统，解决了传统追踪系统限制用户移动的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAVE显示系统的追踪子系统通常有线且限制用户移动，降低了其优势。

Method: 设计并实现了一种低成本（<$200）、无线、基于脚部的追踪器，精度为10 cm，采样率为20 Hz。

Result: 追踪器在校园漫游应用中表现良好，但在需要精确视觉检查的应用中表现不足。

Conclusion: 该追踪器为CAVE系统提供了移动自由，适用于非精确追踪的场景，如漫游应用。

Abstract: CAVE displays offer many advantages over other virtual reality (VR) displays,
including a large, unencumbering viewing space. Unfortunately, the typical
tracking subsystems used with CAVE displays tether the user and lessen this
advantage. We have designed a simple, low-cost feet tracker that is wireless,
leaving the user free to move. The tracker can be assembled for less than $200
US, and achieves an accuracy of 10 cm at a 20 Hz sampling rate. We have tested
the prototype with two applications: a visualization supporting close visual
inspection, and a walkthrough of the campus. Although the tracking was
convincing, it was clear that the tracker's limitations make it less than ideal
for applications requiring precise visual inspection. However, the freedom of
motion allowed by the tracker was a compelling supplement to our campus
walkthrough, allowing users to stroll and look around corners.

Motivation: 随着LLM聊天机器人的广泛应用，其通过有效道歉恢复用户信任的能力变得至关重要。

Method: 通过预注册研究，162名参与者评估了三种道歉方式对三类常见错误的修复效果。

Result: 解释式道歉普遍更受欢迎，但在偏见场景中，共情式道歉因承认情感影响而更受青睐；幻觉错误则无明确偏好。

Conclusion: 有效的AI道歉需考虑个性化与情境校准，以修复用户信任。

Abstract: As chatbots driven by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed
in everyday contexts, their ability to recover from errors through effective
apologies is critical to maintaining user trust and satisfaction. In a
preregistered study with Prolific workers (N=162), we examine user preferences
for three types of apologies (rote, explanatory, and empathic) issued in
response to three categories of common LLM mistakes (bias, unfounded
fabrication, and factual errors). We designed a pairwise experiment in which
participants evaluated chatbot responses consisting of an initial error, a
subsequent apology, and a resolution. Explanatory apologies were generally
preferred, but this varied by context and user. In the bias scenario, empathic
apologies were favored for acknowledging emotional impact, while
hallucinations, though seen as serious, elicited no clear preference,
reflecting user uncertainty. Our findings show the complexity of effective
apology in AI systems. We discuss key insights such as personalization and
calibration that future systems must navigate to meaningfully repair trust.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了三种改进方法，以提升神经语音解码的准确性、效率和实时性，包括时间掩码训练、紧凑Transformer架构和轻量级测试时适应方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速神经语音解码算法的进展，解决现有方法计算成本高且未在实时解码中验证的问题。

Method: 1. 引入大量时间掩码训练；2. 用紧凑Transformer替换GRU；3. 设计轻量级测试时适应方法。

Result: 词错误率降低19.5%，计算成本显著降低，并在实时解码中表现稳定。

Conclusion: 这些改进为准确、高效和实时的神经语音解码提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Speech neuroprostheses aim to restore communication for people with severe
paralysis by decoding speech directly from neural activity. To accelerate
algorithmic progress, a recent benchmark released intracranial recordings from
a paralyzed participant attempting to speak, along with a baseline decoding
algorithm. Prior work on the benchmark showed impressive accuracy gains.
However, these gains increased computational costs and were not demonstrated in
a real-time decoding setting. Here, we make three contributions that pave the
way towards accurate, efficient, and real-time neural speech decoding. First,
we incorporate large amounts of time masking during training. On average, over
$50\%$ of each trial is masked. Second, we replace the gated recurrent unit
(GRU) architecture used in the baseline algorithm with a compact Transformer.
The Transformer architecture uses $77\%$ fewer parameters, cuts peak GPU memory
usage by $36\%$ relative, and is significantly faster to calibrate relative to
the GRU. Third, we design a lightweight variant of an existing test-time
adaptation method developed for decoding handwriting from neural activity. Our
variant adapts the model using multiple time masked augmentations of a single
trial and requires only one gradient step per trial. Together, these
contributions reduce word error rate by $19.5\%$ and effectively mitigate
performance degradations across held-out days in a real-time decoding setting
while substantially lowering computational costs.

Motivation: 研究数据科学家如何将模糊概念转化为具体的目标变量，填补这一过程的理解空白。

Method: 访谈15位来自教育和医疗领域的数据科学家，分析其目标变量构建过程。

Result: 发现数据科学家通过拼凑和迭代调整满足目标变量的五大标准。

Conclusion: 为未来HCI、CSCW和ML研究提供了支持目标变量构建的机会。

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy,
hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the
"healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists
translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly
understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and
healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for
predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct
target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation
between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.
Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable
through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and
resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem
(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable
for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,
predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable
to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,
we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better
support the art and science of target variable construction.

Result: 该方法提供了系统性能的详细信息，优化了训练过程，并能模拟检测距离，估算叫声的空间密度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为声学监测提供了更全面的性能评估和优化工具，有助于提升动物种群监测的效果。

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

Method: 分析ASV嵌入的局限性，提出U3D指标以评估动态节奏模式，并公开代码。

Result: 发现ASV嵌入主要关注静态特征（如音色和音高范围），忽略动态特征（如节奏），并提出了缓解策略。

Conclusion: U3D指标填补了ASV嵌入在动态特征评估上的空白，为声音克隆系统中的身份一致性评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

Result: 在检索和音频效果参数匹配任务中表现优异，能够提取乐器级别的效果表示。

Conclusion: Fx-Encoder++ 填补了智能音乐制作系统中乐器级别音频效果理解的空白。

Abstract: General-purpose audio representations have proven effective across diverse
music information retrieval applications, yet their utility in intelligent
music production remains limited by insufficient understanding of audio effects
(Fx). Although previous approaches have emphasized audio effects analysis at
the mixture level, this focus falls short for tasks demanding instrument-wise
audio effects understanding, such as automatic mixing. In this work, we present
Fx-Encoder++, a novel model designed to extract instrument-wise audio effects
representations from music mixtures. Our approach leverages a contrastive
learning framework and introduces an "extractor" mechanism that, when provided
with instrument queries (audio or text), transforms mixture-level audio effects
embeddings into instrument-wise audio effects embeddings. We evaluated our
model across retrieval and audio effects parameter matching tasks, testing its
performance across a diverse range of instruments. The results demonstrate that
Fx-Encoder++ outperforms previous approaches at mixture level and show a novel
ability to extract effects representation instrument-wise, addressing a
critical capability gap in intelligent music production systems.

Conclusion: 新方法在语音增强任务中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在破坏VC防御方面优于现有净化技术，但仍揭示了对抗性扰动防御的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更鲁棒的解决方案以应对VC带来的安全和隐私风险的紧迫性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and
security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

Motivation: 标准Transformer的注意力机制可能将部分注意力权重分配给无关信息，影响模型的判别能力。

Method: 引入差分注意力机制，结合双softmax操作和调优的差分系数，优化注意力分配。

Result: ASDA在音频分类（AS-2M上49.0% mAP，AS20K上41.5% mAP）、关键词识别（SPC-2上98.3%准确率）和环境声音分类（ESC-50上96.1%准确率）中表现优异。

Conclusion: ASDA在音频任务中表现出色，为更广泛的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有替代模型在实时电网监控和决策支持中表现不佳，尤其是在处理非线性依赖、物理约束和拓扑变化时。

Method: 采用门控图神经网络（GGNN），结合监督学习和物理约束自监督训练策略，在多规模IEEE基准网络上训练。

Result: GGNN在性能上优于现有GNN模型，预测结果接近牛顿-拉夫逊法解，且具有轻量化和可扩展性。

Conclusion: GGNN为实时电网操作提供了一种物理一致、准确且可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable surrogate models for AC power flow are essential for
real-time grid monitoring, contingency analysis, and decision support in
increasingly dynamic and inverter-dominated power systems. However, most
existing surrogates fall short of practical deployment due to their limited
capacity to capture long-range nonlinear dependencies in meshed transmission
networks and their weak enforcement of physical laws. These models often
require extensive hyperparameter tuning, exhibit poor generalization under
topology changes or large load swings, and typically do not quantify
uncertainty or scale well beyond a few hundred buses. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a \textit{gated graph neural network (GGNN)}
surrogate for AC power-flow estimation under topological uncertainty. The model
is trained across multiple IEEE benchmark networks of varying size and
complexity, each incorporating randomized line contingencies and up to 40\%
load variation. To improve robustness and generalization, we explore both
conventional supervised learning and physics-informed self-supervised training
strategies. Comparative evaluations show that the proposed GGNN consistently
outperforms prior GNN-based surrogates, achieving predictions closely aligned
with Newton--Raphson solutions. By embedding operational constraints directly
into the architecture and loss function, the model ensures physical consistency
and delivers a lightweight, accurate, and scalable tool for real-time grid

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒预测方法和在线学习显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and adaptive model predictive control
(MPC) framework for uncertain nonlinear systems affected by bounded
disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. We use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to
learn the uncertain dynamics based on noisy measurements, including those
collected during system operation. As a key contribution, we derive robust
predictions for GP models using contraction metrics, which are incorporated in
the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility,
robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high
probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to
difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements
achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online
learning.

Method: 引入改进的Price of Anarchy作为性能指标，设计通用分区指标，选择最优分区以最小化性能损失。

Result: 在需求灵活的区域供热网络中，该方法仅增加1.9%的热损失，优于基线分区的22%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持稳定性和可行性的同时，性能接近集中式控制器，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel partitioning method designed to minimize control
performance degradation resulting from partitioning a system for distributed
control while maintaining the computational benefits of these methods. A
game-theoretic performance metric, the modified Price of Anarchy, is introduced
and is used in a generalizable partitioning metric to quantify optimality
losses in a distributed controller. By finding the partition that minimizes the
partitioning metric, the best-performing distributed control design is chosen.
The presented partitioning metric is control-design agnostic, making it broadly
applicable to many control design problems. In this paper, the developed metric
is used to minimize the performance losses in the distributed control of a
demand-flexible District Heating Network. The final distributed controller is
provably feasible and stable. In simulation, this novel partitioning performed
similarly to the centralized controller, increasing overall heat losses by only
1.9%, as compared to a similarly-sized baseline partition, which resulted in a
22% increase in losses.

Conclusion: SMDPs在紧密度、内存使用和计算时间之间实现了更优的权衡，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: This work addresses the general problem of control synthesis for
continuous-space, discrete-time stochastic systems with probabilistic
guarantees via finite abstractions. While established methods exist, they often
trade off accuracy for tractability. We propose a unified abstraction framework
that improves both the tightness of probabilistic guarantees and computational
efficiency. First, we introduce multi-interval MDPs (MI-MDPs), a generalization
of interval-valued MDPs (IMDPs), which allows multiple, possibly overlapping
clusters of successor states. This results in tighter abstractions but with
increased computational complexity. To mitigate this, we further propose a
generalized form of MDPs with set-valued transition probabilities (SMDPs),
which model transitions as a fixed probability to a state cluster, followed by
a non-deterministic choice within the cluster, as a sound abstraction. We show
that control synthesis for MI-MDPs reduces to robust dynamic programming via
linear optimization, while SMDPs admit even more efficient synthesis algorithms
that avoid linear programming altogether. Theoretically, we prove that, given
the partitioning of the state and disturbance spaces, both MI-MDPs and SMDPs
yield tighter probabilistic guarantees than IMDPs, and that SMDPs are tighter
than MI-MDPs. Extensive experiments across several benchmarks validate our
theoretical results and demonstrate that SMDPs achieve favorable trade-offs
among tightness, memory usage, and computation time.

Abstract: The emerging Web3 has great potential to provide worldwide decentralized
services powered by global-range data-driven networks in the future. To ensure
the security of Web3 services among diverse user entities, a decentralized
identity (DID) system is essential. Especially, a user's access request to Web3
services can be treated as a DID transaction within the blockchain, executed
through a consensus mechanism. However, a critical implementation issue arises
in the current Web3, i.e., how to deploy network nodes to serve users on a
global scale. To address this issue, emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite
communication systems, such as Starlink, offer a promising solution. With their
global coverage and high reliability, these communication satellites can
complement terrestrial networks as Web3 deployment infrastructures. In this
case, this paper develops three hybrid satellite-ground modes to deploy the
blockchain-enabled DID system for Web3 users. Three modes integrate ground
nodes and satellites to provide flexible and continuous DID services for
worldwide users. Meanwhile, to evaluate the effectiveness of the present hybrid
deployment modes, we analyze the complete DID consensus performance of
blockchain on three hybrid satellite-ground modes. Moreover, we conduct
numerical and simulation experiments to verify the effectiveness of three
hybrid satellite-ground modes. The impacts of various system parameters are
thoroughly analyzed, providing valuable insights for implementing the worldwide
Web3 DID system in real-world network environments.

Abstract: Grid-connected inverter control is challenging to implement due to the
difficulty of obtaining and maintaining an accurate grid model. Direct
Data-Driven Predictive Control provides a model-free alternative to traditional
model-based control methods. This paper describes how the recently-proposed
Transient Predictive Control (TPC) can be used for real-world, plug-and-play
inverter control. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) The TPC algorithm
can be run online using standard hardware, and 2) TPC, which is derived using
Linear Time-Invariant assumptions, is effective for grid-connected inverter
control, which is a nonlinear and time-varying system. Experiments conducted on
a two-converter benchtop setup and at the CoSES Laboratory on a 25 kVA
converter connected to the Munich grid support these hypotheses.

Abstract: The optimal management of a building's microclimate to satisfy the occupants'
needs and objectives in terms of comfort, energy efficiency, and costs is
particularly challenging. This complexity arises from the non-linear,
time-dependent interactions among all the variables of the control problem and
the changing internal and external constraints. Focusing on the accurate
modeling of the indoor temperature, we propose a data-driven approach to
address this challenge. We account for thermal inertia, non-linear effects,
small perturbations of the indoor climate dynamics caused by ventilation and
weather variations, as well as for the stochastic nature of the control system
due to the observed noise in the input signal. Since the prohibitive cost of
quality data acquisition and processing limits the implementation of
data-driven approaches for real-life problems, we applied a method that merges
several Bayesian machine learning and deep learning architectures that are
suitable for predicting complex system dynamics, while relaxing the dataset
quality requirements. Our framework includes a built-in deep Kalman filter,
which makes it deployable even with low-accuracy temperature sensors. It
achieves state-of-the-art performance, best performing with a 150-minute
prediction horizon with an RMSE of 0.2455, an MAE of 0.162, and an $R^2$ of
0.926. The model's performance remains consistent even when exposed to highly
noisy data. Finally, we show how our approach can be extended to other
applications including demand response event duration prediction and equipment
failure detection.

Result: 结果表明，子空间偏差和乐观偏差是导致基于子空间的DDPC方法跟踪性能差的主要原因，而瞬态预测控制不受这些偏差影响。

Conclusion: 结论指出，基于子空间的DDPC方法存在固有偏差，而瞬态预测控制是一种更优的无偏差替代方案。

Abstract: This paper quantifies and addresses the bias of subspace-based Data-Driven
Predictive Control (DDPC) for linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems. The primary
focus is the bias that arises when the training data is gathered with a
feedback controller in closed-loop with the system. First, the closed-loop bias
of Subspace Predictive Control is quantified using the training data
innovations. Next, the bias of direct, subspace-based DDPC methods DeePC and
$\gamma$-DDPC is shown to consist of two parts--the Subspace Bias, which arises
from closed-loop data, and an Optimism Bias, which arises from
DeePC/$\gamma$-DDPC's "optimistic" adjustment of the output trajectory. We show
that, unlike subspace-based DDPC methods, Transient Predictive Control does not
suffer from Subspace Bias or Optimism Bias. Double integrator experiments
demonstrate that Subspace and Optimism Bias are responsible for poor reference
tracking by the subspace-based DDPC methods.

Abstract: Achieving rapid and time-deterministic stabilization for complex systems
characterized by strong nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties presents a
significant challenge. Traditional model-based control relies on precise system
models, whereas purely data-driven methods often lack formal stability
guarantees, limiting their applicability in safety-critical systems. This paper
proposes a novel control framework that synergistically integrates data-driven
modeling with model-based control. The framework first employs the Extended
Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (EDMDc) to identify a high-dimensional
Koopman linear model and quantify its bounded uncertainty from data.
Subsequently, a novel Prescribed-Time Adaptive Backstepping (PTAB) controller
is synthesized based on this data-driven model. The design leverages the
structural advantages of Koopman linearization to systematically handle model
errors and circumvent the "explosion of complexity" issue inherent in
traditional backstepping. The proposed controller is validated through
simulations on the classic Van der Pol oscillator. The results demonstrate that
the controller can precisely stabilize the system states to a small
neighborhood of the origin within a user-prescribed time, regardless of the
initial conditions, while ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals.
This research successfully combines the flexibility of data-driven approaches
with the rigor of Lyapunov-based analysis. It provides a high-performance
control strategy with quantifiable performance and pre-assignable settling time
for nonlinear systems, showcasing its great potential for controlling complex
dynamics.

Result: 数值模拟表明，该方法在保证串稳定性的同时减少了跟踪误差。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动态切换拓扑下的车辆编队稳定性问题。

Abstract: Switching communication topologies can cause instability in vehicle platoons,
as vehicle information may be lost during the dynamic switching process. This
highlights the need to design a controller capable of maintaining the stability
of vehicle platoons under dynamically changing topologies. However, capturing
the dynamic characteristics of switching topologies and obtaining complete
vehicle information for controller design while ensuring stability remains a
significant challenge. In this study, we propose an observer-based distributed
model predictive control (DMPC) method for vehicle platoons under directed
Markovian switching topologies. Considering the stochastic nature of the
switching topologies, we model the directed switching communication topologies
using a continuous-time Markov chain. To obtain the leader vehicle's
information for controller design, we develop a fully distributed adaptive
observer that can quickly adapt to the randomly switching topologies, ensuring
that the observed information is not affected by the dynamic topology switches.
Additionally, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the mean-square
stability of the observer. Furthermore, we construct the DMPC terminal update
law based on the observer and formulate a string stability constraint based on
the observed information. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method can
reduce tracking errors while ensuring string stability.

operations. This paper gives a precise, formal description of the software
control of the lock complex in less than 400 lines of mCRL2 code. This
description can act as a blueprint on how the software of this lock complex

Conclusion: 通过形式化的经济控制，本文为分布式系统提供了新的理论框架，突破了CAP定理的传统限制。

Abstract: The CAP theorem asserts a trilemma between consistency, availability, and
partition tolerance. This paper introduces a rigorous automata-theoretic and
economically grounded framework that reframes the CAP trade-off as a constraint
optimization problem. We model distributed systems as partition-aware state
machines and embed economic incentive layers to stabilize consensus behavior
across adversarially partitioned networks. By incorporating game-theoretic
mechanisms into the global transition semantics, we define provable bounds on
convergence, liveness, and correctness. Our results demonstrate that
availability and consistency can be simultaneously preserved within bounded
epsilon margins, effectively extending the classical CAP limits through formal
economic control.

Abstract: We introduce Team Utility-Constrained Proximal Policy Optimization (TUC-PPO),
a new deep reinforcement learning framework. It extends Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) by integrating team welfare objectives specifically for
spatial public goods games. Unlike conventional approaches where cooperation
emerges indirectly from individual rewards, TUC-PPO instead optimizes a
bi-level objective integrating policy gradients and team utility constraints.
Consequently, all policy updates explicitly incorporate collective payoff
thresholds. The framework preserves PPO's policy gradient core while
incorporating constrained optimization through adaptive Lagrangian multipliers.
Therefore, decentralized agents dynamically balance selfish and cooperative
incentives. The comparative analysis demonstrates superior performance of this
constrained deep reinforcement learning approach compared to unmodified PPO and
evolutionary game theory baselines. It achieves faster convergence to
cooperative equilibria and greater stability against invasion by defectors. The
framework formally integrates team objectives into policy updates. This work
advances multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for social dilemmas while
providing new computational tools for evolutionary game theory research.

Result: 证明在包括首价和全付拍卖的一类非真实拍卖中，BCE可通过多项式样本学习。

Conclusion: 为拍卖系统设计提供了新的理论支持，表明BCE在实际中可高效学习。

Abstract: In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the
independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium
notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize
and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better
auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make
incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the
bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The
implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of
bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study
of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in
non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful
auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a
polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the
bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of
estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of
the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of
bidders.

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting has created the need to

Abstract: Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under
real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications.
A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling
or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their
surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based
lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment
maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area
light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.
Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be
executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is
partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the
corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we
obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each
region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically
sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian
approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time
approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material
properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable
performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single
directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our
approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment
map.

*Cong Wang,Roberto Calandra,Verena Klös*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了用户对机器人解释需求与内容的偏好，提出两种算法以识别意外行为并构建有效解释，优化人机交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人执行复杂任务时，偏离预期的行为可能让用户困惑，需通过解释帮助理解其意图，但需避免过度解释引起用户反感。

Method: 调查用户对厨房清洁机器人解释偏好，提出两种算法识别意外行为并生成解释，适用于BDI机器人。

Result: 用户希望在意外情况下获得解释，偏好简洁明确的内容，包括意图和相关上下文因素。

Conclusion: 提出的算法可无缝集成到BDI推理中，为个性化解释的人机交互铺平道路。

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

Abstract: We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language
foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for
complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a
lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous
architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact
size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of
embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B
variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary
models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities,
including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial
referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g.,
closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph
updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction,
multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We
hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step
toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark

*Miroslav Cibula,Kristína Malinovská,Matthias Kerzel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于认知启发的自监督学习方法，用于机器人轨迹规划，通过递归架构生成轨迹模型，避免了传统采样规划的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统轨迹规划方法计算密集，而完全监督方法仅模仿轨迹，无法确保目标可达性。因此，作者提出自监督学习方案，以更高效地生成适应性强的轨迹。

Method: 采用递归架构的自监督学习方案，结合正向和逆向运动学模型，生成轨迹模型。

Result: 模型能够仅通过给定的运动学模型学习生成轨迹，适用于需要自适应解决方案的复杂操作任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂机器人操作任务提供了一种高效且适应性强的轨迹规划解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

Result: 模型在仿真和真实数据上表现优异，具备良好的仿真到现实的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于多种机器人任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic
system.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 扩展DRIFT框架，结合GPS和IMU数据，实现精确位姿和航向估计，适用于海洋自主水面车辆及其他移动系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPS和IMU数据融合中的航向不可观测性问题，提供漂移无关的定位和可靠航向估计。

Method: 基于DRIFT算法，引入对称保持传感器融合流程，利用InEKF整合GPS全局位置更新，并提出新颖的航向校正机制。

Result: 在BlueBoat上验证，实现了精确的航向观测和定位，适用于GPS信号不佳的环境。

Conclusion: 提供开源解决方案，为未来实验和比较研究奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the DRIFT invariant state estimation
framework, enabling robust fusion of GPS and IMU data for accurate pose and
heading estimation. Originally developed for testing and usage on a marine
autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), this approach can also be utilized on other
mobile systems. Building upon the original proprioceptive only DRIFT algorithm,
we develop a symmetry-preserving sensor fusion pipeline utilizing the invariant
extended Kalman filter (InEKF) to integrate global position updates from GPS
directly into the correction step. Crucially, we introduce a novel heading
correction mechanism that leverages GPS course-over-ground information in
conjunction with IMU orientation, overcoming the inherent unobservability of
yaw in dead-reckoning. The system was deployed and validated on a customized
Blue Robotics BlueBoat, but the methodological focus is on the algorithmic
approach to fusing exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors for drift-free
localization and reliable orientation estimation. This work provides an open
source solution for accurate yaw observation and localization in challenging or
GPS-degraded conditions, and lays the groundwork for future experimental and
comparative studies.

Abstract: Simulators are useful tools for testing automated driving controllers.
Vehicle-in-the-loop (ViL) tests and digital twins (DTs) are widely used
simulation technologies to facilitate the smooth deployment of controllers to
physical vehicles. However, conventional ViL tests rely on full-size vehicles,
requiring large space and high expenses. Also, physical-model-based DT suffers
from the reality gap caused by modeling imprecision. This paper develops a
comprehensive and practical simulator for testing automated driving controllers
enhanced by scaled physical cars and AI-powered DT models. The scaled cars
allow for saving space and expenses of simulation tests. The AI-powered DT
models ensure superior simulation fidelity. Moreover, the simulator integrates
well with off-the-shelf software and control algorithms, making it easy to
extend. We use a filtered control benchmark with formal safety guarantees to
showcase the capability of the simulator in validating automated driving
controllers. Experimental studies are performed to showcase the efficacy of the
simulator, implying its great potential in validating control solutions for
autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic.

### [203] [Path Planning using a One-shot-sampling Skeleton Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02328)
*Gabriel O. Flores-Aquino,Octavio Gutierrez-Frias,Juan Irving Vasquez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度去噪自编码器（DDAE）和U-Net架构的路径规划方法SkelUnet，用于高效生成骨架化导航地图，并在无人机模拟环境中验证了其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统骨架化算法资源消耗大且主要用于图像处理，而路径规划需要平衡响应时间、安全性和路径长度，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 使用SkelUnet网络通过单次采样（OSS）生成骨架化地图，替代传统迭代或概率采样方法，并在12,500张二维地图上训练和测试。

Result: 在250张未见地图的无人机模拟测试中，SkelUnet显著提高了路径安全性、连通性和处理速度。

Conclusion: SkelUnet方法适用于结构化环境中的移动服务机器人，因其高效性和安全性优势。

Abstract: Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

Abstract: In the future, mobility will be strongly shaped by the increasing use of
digitalization. Not only will individual road users be highly interconnected,
but also the road and associated infrastructure. At that point, a Digital Twin
becomes particularly appealing because, unlike a basic simulation, it offers a
continuous, bilateral connection linking the real and virtual environments.
This paper describes the digital reconstruction used to develop the Digital
Twin of the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-W\"urttemberg (TAF-BW), Germany.
The TAF-BW offers a variety of different road sections, from high-traffic urban
intersections and tunnels to multilane motorways. The test area is equipped
with a comprehensive Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication infrastructure
and multiple intelligent intersections equipped with camera sensors to
facilitate real-time traffic flow monitoring. The generation of authentic data
as input for the Digital Twin was achieved by extracting object lists at the
intersections. This process was facilitated by the combined utilization of
camera images from the intelligent infrastructure and LiDAR sensors mounted on
a test vehicle. Using a unified interface, recordings from real-world
detections of traffic participants can be resimulated. Additionally, the
simulation framework's design and the reconstruction process is discussed. The
resulting framework is made publicly available for download and utilization at:
https://digit4taf-bw.fzi.de The demonstration uses two case studies to
illustrate the application of the digital twin and its interfaces: the analysis
of traffic signal systems to optimize traffic flow and the simulation of
security-related scenarios in the communications sector.

Motivation: 解决现有协作感知方法对高通信带宽和模型架构访问的依赖问题，适应实际自动驾驶场景中的通信限制和模型保护需求。

Method: 引入基于共享3D边界框属性的后期协作框架，无需直接访问检测模型，实现多源多目标融合。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了实际协作感知挑战，为高效可扩展的多智能体融合设定了新基准。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于约束最优控制问题的辅助控制器框架，通过离线计算控制不变集，确保在线控制动作的可行性、严格约束满足和最小化用户意图覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共享控制方法在可行性、可扩展性或安全性保证方面存在不足，尤其是用户输入不可预测。

Method: 基于约束最优控制问题，结合离线计算的控制不变集，支持在线计算控制动作，并能处理非凸约束。

Result: 通过大规模用户研究验证，在任务负载、信任、感知控制和性能方面均有改善，且不牺牲安全性和用户意图。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了共享控制中的关键挑战，提升了任务效果和用户体验。

Abstract: Shared control combines human intention with autonomous decision-making, from
low-level safety overrides to high-level task guidance, enabling systems that
adapt to users while ensuring safety and performance. This enhances task
effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics,
teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control
methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or
learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety
guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable.
  To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework
based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an
offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control
actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal
override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured
class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We
validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66
participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a
computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in
addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all
these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.

Conclusion: 该方法通过顺应性动作模块实现了鲁棒性和顺应性的平衡，显著提升了四足机器人的性能。

Abstract: Despite recent remarkable achievements in quadruped control, it remains
challenging to ensure robust and compliant locomotion in the presence of
unforeseen external disturbances. Existing methods prioritize locomotion
robustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and
energy inefficiency. This paper, therefore, presents a two-stage hierarchical
learning framework that can learn to take active reactions to external force
disturbances based on force estimation. In the first stage, a velocity-tracking
policy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical
proprioceptive features. A neural network-based estimator is learned through
supervised learning, which estimates body velocity and external forces based on
proprioceptive measurements. In the second stage, a compliance action module,
inspired by impedance control, is learned based on the pre-trained encoder and
policy. This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in
response to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the
compliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor
disturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking
a balance between robustness and compliance. Simulations and real-world
experiments have demonstrated that our method has superior performance in terms
of robustness, energy efficiency, and safety. Experiment comparison shows that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based locomotion controllers.
Ablation studies are given to show the critical roles of the compliance action
module.

Abstract: Under-actuated compliant robotic systems offer a promising approach to
mitigating actuation and control challenges by harnessing pre-designed,
embodied dynamic behaviors. This paper presents Flix-Walker, a novel,
untethered, centimeter-scale quadrupedal robot inspired by compliant
under-actuated mechanisms. Flix-Walker employs flexible, helix-shaped beams as
legs, which are actuated by vibrations from just two motors to achieve three
distinct mobility modes. We analyze the actuation parameters required to
generate various locomotion modes through both simulation and prototype
experiments. The effects of system and environmental variations on locomotion
performance are examined, and we propose a generic metric for selecting control
parameters that produce robust and functional motions. Experiments validate the
effectiveness and robustness of these actuation parameters within a closed-loop
control framework, demonstrating reliable trajectory-tracking and
self-navigation capabilities.

Abstract: Articulated object manipulation remains a critical challenge in robotics due
to the complex kinematic constraints and the limited physical reasoning of
existing methods. In this work, we introduce ArtGS, a novel framework that
extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating visual-physical modeling
for articulated object understanding and interaction. ArtGS begins with
multi-view RGB-D reconstruction, followed by reasoning with a vision-language
model (VLM) to extract semantic and structural information, particularly the
articulated bones. Through dynamic, differentiable 3DGS-based rendering, ArtGS
optimizes the parameters of the articulated bones, ensuring physically
consistent motion constraints and enhancing the manipulation policy. By
leveraging dynamic Gaussian splatting, cross-embodiment adaptability, and
closed-loop optimization, ArtGS establishes a new framework for efficient,

Abstract: Robotic grasping faces challenges in adapting to objects with varying shapes
and sizes. In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method
that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature
enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction
between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer,
while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level
features, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine
geometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp
utilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among
positive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features.
Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate
that MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop
decluttering tasks. More details are available at https://miscgrasp.github.io/.

Abstract: In disaster response scenarios, deploying robotic teams effectively is
crucial for improving situational awareness and enhancing search and rescue
operations. The use of robots in search and rescue has been studied but the
question of where to start robot deployments has not been addressed. This work
addresses the problem of optimally selecting starting locations for robots with
heterogeneous capabilities by formulating a joint optimization problem. To
determine start locations, this work adds a constraint to the ergodic
optimization framework whose minimum assigns robots to start locations. This
becomes a little more challenging when the robots are heterogeneous (equipped
with different sensing and motion modalities) because not all robots start at
the same location, and a more complex adaptation of the aforementioned
constraint is applied. Our method assumes access to potential starting
locations, which can be obtained from expert knowledge or aerial imagery. We
experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our joint optimization approach by
comparing it to baseline methods that use fixed starting locations for all
robots. Our experimental results show significant gains in coverage
performance, with average improvements of 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91%
on real-world data for homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, in terms of the
ergodic metric.

Abstract: We present an efficient hierarchical motion planning pipeline for
differential drive mobile manipulators. Our approach first searches for
multiple collisionfree and topologically distinct paths for the mobile base to
extract the space in which optimal solutions may exist. Further sampling and
optimization are then conducted in parallel to explore feasible whole-body
trajectories. For trajectory optimization, we employ polynomial trajectories
and arc length-yaw parameterization, enabling efficient handling of the
nonholonomic dynamics while ensuring optimality.

Abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the
real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.

Motivation: 探索LLM在动态、实时、多智能体协作环境中的表现，填补现有研究在静态或回合制场景中的不足。

Conclusion: 游戏理论指导与实时反馈的结合显著提升了LLM在多智能体系统中的协作效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities across
mathematical, strategic, and linguistic tasks, yet little is known about how
well they reason in dynamic, real-time, multi-agent scenarios, such as
collaborative environments in which agents continuously adapt to each other's
behavior, as in cooperative gameplay settings. In this paper, we bridge this
gap by combining LLM-driven agents with strategic reasoning and real-time
adaptation in cooperative, multi-agent environments grounded in game-theoretic
principles such as belief consistency and Nash equilibrium. The proposed
framework applies broadly to dynamic scenarios in which agents coordinate,
communicate, and make decisions in response to continuously changing
conditions. We provide real-time strategy refinement and adaptive feedback
mechanisms that enable agents to dynamically adjust policies based on immediate
contextual interactions, in contrast to previous efforts that evaluate LLM
capabilities in static or turn-based settings. Empirical results show that our
method achieves up to a 26\% improvement in return over PPO baselines in
high-noise environments, while maintaining real-time latency under 1.05
milliseconds. Our approach improves collaboration efficiency, task completion
rates, and flexibility, illustrating that game-theoretic guidance integrated
with real-time feedback enhances LLM performance, ultimately fostering more
resilient and flexible strategic multi-agent systems.
