Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedeCouple是一种联邦学习方法，通过在细粒度级别平衡全局泛化和局部适应性，联合学习全局和局部特征表示，并使用动态知识蒸馏来增强个性化分类器的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有个性化联邦学习方法在特征提取器局部适应性和分类器全局泛化方面的不足，改善组件间的协调性和耦合度。

Method: 联合学习全局和局部特征表示，采用动态知识蒸馏，引入锚点来优化特征空间，锚点的严格局部性和非传输特性保护隐私并减少通信开销。

Result: 在五个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedeCouple在有效性、稳定性、可扩展性和安全性方面持续优于九种基线方法，有效性实验中比最佳基线高出4.3%。

Conclusion: FedeCouple通过平衡全局泛化和局部适应性，显著提升了联邦学习在异构客户端数据场景下的性能，并提供了收敛性理论保证。

Abstract: In privacy-preserving mobile network transmission scenarios with heterogeneous client data, personalized federated learning methods that decouple feature extractors and classifiers have demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing learning capability. However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.

TL;DR: 本文提出ParaBench基准测试，发现现有顺序自回归方法在思维感知生成中存在错误传播导致的性能下降问题，并提出并行多模态扩散框架MMaDA-Parallel来解决跨模态对齐问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有思维感知生成方法在复杂任务中存在错误传播问题，导致性能下降，特别是生成的推理与最终图像之间缺乏对齐。

Method: 提出并行多模态扩散框架MMaDA-Parallel，支持文本和图像在去噪轨迹中的连续双向交互，采用监督微调训练，并通过并行强化学习(ParaRL)优化跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验表明，MMaDA-Parallel显著改善了跨模态对齐和语义一致性，在ParaBench上比最先进模型Bagel在输出对齐方面提升了6.9%。

Conclusion: MMaDA-Parallel为思维感知图像合成建立了更鲁棒的范式，通过并行交互机制有效解决了跨模态对齐问题。

Abstract: While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

Conclusion: 通过提供语音创伤严重程度评估的自动化工具，能够实现大规模语音创伤研究，最终改善临床理解和患者护理。

Abstract: Phonotrauma refers to vocal fold tissue damage resulting from exposure to forces during voicing. It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令式图像编辑模型对多指令提示中的每个指令应用固定强度，限制了用户精确连续控制单个编辑强度的能力。

Result: 应用于FLUX-Kontext和Qwen-Image-Edit等先进图像编辑模型，在编辑可控性、视觉一致性和用户可操控性方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: SliderEdit是首个探索和提出在指令式图像编辑模型中实现连续精细指令控制的框架，为交互式指令驱动图像操作铺平了道路。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models have recently achieved impressive performance, enabling complex edits to an input image from a multi-instruction prompt. However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models. Our results pave the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

Abstract: This study enhances a crowd density estimation algorithm originally designed for image-based analysis by adapting it for video-based scenarios. The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉定位方法（如PALMS）在智能手机LiDAR短距离和室内布局模糊性方面的限制，实现更准确的基础设施无关室内定位。

Method: 使用基础单目深度估计模型（Depth Pro）从定位的RGB图像重建尺度对齐的3D点云，然后通过卷积与平面图进行几何布局匹配，输出位置和方向的后验分布。

Result: 在Structured3D和包含80个观测的校园数据集上，PALMS+在静态定位精度上优于PALMS和F3Loc，且无需训练。在33条真实轨迹的序列定位中，与粒子滤波器集成后获得更低的定位误差。

Conclusion: PALMS+展示了在无基础设施应用中的鲁棒性，为无摄像头跟踪提供了潜力，证明了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Abstract: In dynamic and crowded environments, realistic pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of human motion and the mutual influences among individuals. Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.

Abstract: Soiling detection for automotive cameras is a crucial part of advanced driver assistance systems to make them more robust to external conditions like weather, dust, etc. In this paper, we regard the soiling detection as a semantic segmentation problem. We provide a comprehensive comparison of popular segmentation methods and show their superiority in performance while comparing them to tile-level classification approaches. Moreover, we present an extensive analysis of the Woodscape dataset showing that the original dataset contains a data-leakage and imprecise annotations. To address these problems, we create a new data subset, which, despite being much smaller, provides enough information for the segmentation method to reach comparable results in a much shorter time.

TL;DR: 评估8个医学和通用领域基础模型在胸部X光分析中的表现，发现医学预训练具有优势，但特征有效性高度依赖任务，对于复杂病理分割任务，预训练特征效果有限，监督模型仍是强有力替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在医学影像中的有效性存在差异，目前不清楚预训练领域、范式和架构如何影响嵌入质量，这阻碍了为特定放射学任务选择最优编码器。

Method: 评估8个医学和通用领域基础模型的视觉编码器用于胸部X光分析，使用线性探测和微调方法对分类（气胸、心脏肥大）和分割（气胸、心脏边界）任务进行基准测试。

Result: 医学预训练具有显著优势；医学基础模型在线性探测中始终优于通用领域模型，建立了更优的初始特征质量。但对于分割复杂细微病理（如气胸），所有基础模型在未进行显著微调时表现不佳。子组分析显示基础模型使用混淆捷径进行分类。

Conclusion: 医学预训练有益，但架构选择至关重要，预训练特征并非普遍有效，特别是在复杂定位任务中，监督模型仍是强有力的替代方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) promise to generalize medical imaging, but their effectiveness varies. It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.

Abstract: Developing reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection methods requires diverse datasets that capture realistic variations in iris features and a wide spectrum of anomalies. Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation and tracking are fundamental capabilities for physical AI systems such as robots. However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.

Conclusion: PANDA框架有效解决了无样本持续学习中的双重不平衡问题，提升了模型在现实世界数据流中的学习能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有动画流水线使用网格或点云作为3D表示，而3DGS在新型视图合成中达到最先进的光照真实效果，但在人-场景动画和交互方面仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用3DGS作为3D表示，将渲染与运动合成解耦；提出高斯对齐运动模块，使用基于不透明度的线索和投影高斯结构来指导人体放置和姿态对齐；进一步提出人-场景高斯细化优化以确保自然交互。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了3DGS在单目视频人体动画中的独特优势，能够实现高质量的人-场景交互动画。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.

TL;DR: CertMask是一种可证明鲁棒的防御方法，通过单轮掩码操作有效对抗对抗性补丁攻击，相比现有方法显著降低了计算复杂度并提高了认证鲁棒精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁攻击通过在图像中注入局部扰动来误导深度视觉模型，这些攻击可以在物理世界中部署，对实际应用构成严重风险。现有最先进方法需要两轮掩码且推理成本为O(n²)，需要更高效的防御方案。

Method: CertMask构建一组可证明充分的二进制掩码来中和补丁效应，采用数学严谨的覆盖策略确保每个可能的补丁位置至少被覆盖k次，仅需单轮掩码操作，时间复杂度为O(n)。

Result: 在ImageNet、ImageNette和CIFAR-10上的实验表明，CertMask相比PatchCleanser将认证鲁棒精度提高了高达+13.4%，同时保持与原始模型几乎相同的干净精度。

Conclusion: CertMask提供了一种高效且可证明鲁棒的防御机制，显著降低了对抗性补丁攻击的威胁，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks inject localized perturbations into images to mislead deep vision models. These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

Conclusion: IPCD-Net成功解决了点云内在分解的关键挑战，验证了在真实世界中的适用性，为点云处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used in various fields, including augmented reality (AR) and robotics, where relighting and texture editing are crucial for realistic visualization. Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade. Furthermore, we showcase its applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varying illumination. Finally, we verify the real-world applicability of IPCD-Net.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种推理阶段的三步衰减恢复策略（T-DRS），用于缓解大型视觉语言模型在使用旋转位置编码时面临的长距离依赖建模问题，包括语义驱动、距离感知控制和重新强化远程依赖三个组件。

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在使用旋转位置编码时存在渐进注意力衰减问题，随着token距离增加，模型难以记忆全局上下文，这严重影响了长距离依赖的建模能力。

Method: 提出推理阶段的三步衰减恢复策略：1）语义驱动DRS通过内容感知残差放大语义上有意义但距离较远的信号；2）距离感知控制DRS基于位置距离平滑调节注意力权重，抑制噪声同时保持局部性；3）重新强化远程DRS巩固剩余的信息性远程依赖以维持全局一致性。

Result: 在视觉问答基准测试上的广泛实验表明，T-DRS能够以无需训练的方式持续提升模型性能。

Conclusion: T-DRS策略能够在不损害局部归纳偏置的情况下恢复被抑制的长距离token对，有效解决了旋转位置编码导致的注意力衰减问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

Motivation: 解决直接应用SAM基础模型到RGB-D视频显著目标检测任务时面临的三个挑战：依赖手动提示、顺序适配器内存消耗高、记忆注意力计算负担重。

Method: 提出SAM-DAQ方法，包含：1）并行适配器多模态图像编码器（PAMIE），使用深度引导并行适配器在无提示条件下微调SAM编码器；2）查询驱动时序记忆模块（QTM），统一内存库和提示嵌入到可学习管道中，同时利用帧级和视频级查询。

Result: 在三个RGB-D VSOD数据集上的广泛实验表明，SAM-DAQ在所有评估指标上均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: SAM-DAQ成功将SAM2适配于RGB-D视频显著目标检测，通过深度和时序线索的无缝集成，实现了卓越的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently segment anything model (SAM) has attracted widespread concerns, and it is often treated as a vision foundation model for universal segmentation. Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个基于递归目标条件变换器的多智能体轨迹预测模型，通过结合长期意图、历史运动和社会交互建模，在MADRAS和SDD数据集上实现了最先进的预测精度和显著降低的碰撞率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时捕捉智能体的长期目标和细粒度社会交互，导致多智能体未来轨迹预测不真实。需要开发能够联合建模长期意图和社会交互的预测框架。

Method: 提出VISTA模型，包含：(1)交叉注意力融合模块整合长期意图与历史运动；(2)社会令牌注意力机制实现灵活的多智能体交互建模；(3)成对注意力图在推理时提供可解释的社会影响模式。

Result: 在MADRAS基准测试中，将强基线的平均碰撞率从2.14%降低到0.03%；在SDD数据集上实现零碰撞，同时改进ADE、FDE和minFDE指标。

Conclusion: VISTA能够生成社会合规、目标感知且可解释的轨迹，在安全关键自主系统中具有应用前景。

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HCC-3D的分层补偿压缩方法，用于高效压缩3D视觉语言模型中的3D token，在保持关键细节的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D-VLMs直接将3D点云嵌入为3D token，但这种方法在大型语言模型部分处理所有3D token时会产生巨大的计算开销，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出了分层补偿压缩方法：1）全局结构压缩（GSC），使用全局查询将3D token压缩为少量关键token；2）自适应细节挖掘（ADM），通过互补评分选择性重新压缩显著但未被充分关注的特征。

Result: HCC-3D实现了约98%的极端压缩比，同时达到了新的最先进性能，在效率和性能方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分层补偿压缩策略有效解决了3D-VLMs的计算瓶颈问题，在保持信息完整性的同时大幅降低了计算开销。

Abstract: 3D understanding has drawn significant attention recently, leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable multi-modal reasoning between point cloud and text data. Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: M3DSG和MSGNav系统通过多模态场景表示和专门设计的推理模块，显著提升了零样本导航的性能和泛化能力，为现实世界机器人部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

Motivation: 当前VLA模型在机器人操作中存在两个关键限制：1）感知冗余，处理不相关视觉输入效率低下；2）表面化的指令-视觉对齐，阻碍了动作的语义基础。这些问题阻碍了实际部署。

Conclusion: SemanticVLA在性能和效率上都达到了新的最先进水平，为机器人操作的VLA模型部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

Abstract: Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

TL;DR: VLF-MSC是一种基于视觉语言特征的多模态语义通信系统，通过传输单一紧凑的视觉语言表示来同时支持图像和文本生成，提高频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信技术分别处理每种模态，需要特定模态的流或重传，导致频谱效率低下。需要一种统一的多模态语义通信系统。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型将源图像编码为视觉语言语义特征（VLF），在接收端基于该特征同时生成描述文本和语义对齐的图像。

Result: 实验表明VLF-MSC在低信噪比下优于仅文本和仅图像的基线方法，以显著减少的带宽实现更高的语义准确性。

Conclusion: VLF-MSC通过统一的视觉语言表示实现了高效的多模态语义通信，具有噪声鲁棒性和语义保真度。

Abstract: We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

Conclusion: MosaicDoc为视觉丰富文档理解领域提供了权威基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capabilities are inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks, which are predominantly English-centric, feature simplistic layouts, and support limited tasks. Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their current limitations in handling real-world document complexity and charts a clear path for future research.

Result: 在标准CIL基准测试中，SLDC显著提升了SeqFT的性能，结合知识蒸馏后，顺序微调在所有评估数据集上达到了与联合训练相当的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in many real-world applications such as pedestrian trajectory tracking. However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSPE-GS是一种改进3D高斯溅射的方法，通过均匀采样透射率来建模像素级多模态不透明度和深度分布，解决半透明表面重建问题，同时保持不透明场景性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯溅射方法假设每个像素只有一个深度，这无法处理半透明表面中多个表面可见的情况，导致重建失败。

Method: 提出TSPE-GS方法，通过均匀采样透射率建模像素级多模态不透明度和深度分布，替代先前的单峰假设；通过渐进融合截断符号距离函数，在统一框架内分别重建外部和内部表面。

Result: 在公开和自收集的半透明及不透明数据集上的广泛实验表明，TSPE-GS显著改善了半透明几何重建，同时保持了对不透明场景的性能。

Conclusion: TSPE-GS能够有效解决半透明表面重建中的交叉表面深度模糊问题，且无需额外训练开销即可推广到其他基于高斯的重建流程中。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting offers a strong speed-quality trade-off but struggles to reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces because most methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible. We propose TSPE-GS (Transparent Surface Probabilistic Extraction for Gaussian Splatting), which uniformly samples transmittance to model a pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, replacing the prior single-peak assumption and resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity. By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework. The method generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected semi-transparent and opaque datasets show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应融合框架，将CLIP图像特征的余弦相似度与幅度感知质量线索相结合，用于无参考图像质量评估，无需特定任务训练即可超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用CLIP模型的余弦相似度进行图像质量评估，忽略了图像特征幅度与感知质量之间的强相关性，需要更全面的质量线索融合。

Method: 提出自适应融合框架：提取CLIP图像特征的绝对值，应用Box-Cox变换进行统计归一化，生成语义归一化的辅助线索；设计置信度引导的融合方案，根据相对强度自适应加权两个线索。

Result: 在多个基准IQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于标准CLIP-based IQA和最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合余弦相似度和幅度感知质量线索的自适应融合，可以显著提升无参考图像质量评估的性能，无需额外训练即可实现优越表现。

Abstract: Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用视觉语言模型生成伪标签来训练高效实时目标检测器的新方法，通过基于每目标协同教学的训练策略来减轻VLM生成标签中的噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在零样本目标检测方面表现优异，但其检测延迟和幻觉预测问题使其无法直接部署。在自动驾驶等需要大量标注数据的领域，人工标注成本过高。

Method: 采用基于每目标协同教学的训练策略，两个YOLO模型协作学习，根据彼此的每目标损失值从每个小批次中过滤不可靠的边界框，而不是过滤整个图像。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，方法显著优于基线YOLOv5m模型，mAP@0.5从31.12%提升到46.61%，同时保持实时检测延迟。补充10%真实标签后，mAP@0.5达到57.97%。在ACDC和BDD100k数据集上也观察到类似性能提升。

Conclusion: 该管道为自动驾驶提供了一种高效、鲁棒且可扩展的方法来训练高性能目标检测器，显著减少了对昂贵人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs), offer compelling zero-shot object detection for applications like autonomous driving, a domain where manual labelling is prohibitively expensive. However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, especially diffusion models, have significantly improved image restoration (IR) performance. However, existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration (DMIR) methods face challenges in fully leveraging diffusion priors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR methods by analyzing their sampling process and providing effective solutions. We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$. TAS prioritizes deterministic steps to enhance certainty and sampling efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method is compatible with previous problem-agnostic DMIR methods and significantly boosts their performance without increasing computational costs.

Conclusion: DiVE方法通过约束差异向量来保持嵌入几何结构，成功解决了视觉语言模型在微调时泛化能力下降的问题。

Abstract: Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.

Conclusion: STELLAR通过创新的多语言编辑架构和训练策略，有效解决了场景文本编辑中的关键挑战，为低资源语言和真实世界数据提供了可靠的编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) is the task of modifying text content in an image while preserving its visual style, such as font, color, and background. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that STELLAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving an average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over the baselines.

Conclusion: MOBA揭示了一类新的物理可实现威胁，强调了在真实环境中考虑材料级属性的防御措施的紧迫需求。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%. Our work reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the urgent need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.

Abstract: How can we accurately quantize a pre-trained Vision Transformer model? Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

Abstract: We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.

Abstract: As a critical task in autonomous driving perception systems, 3D object detection is used to identify and track key objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians. However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架为处理复杂拓扑结构的3D内容生成提供了更稳健和计算高效的解决方案，突破了传统3D VAE在分辨率上的限制。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D contents remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of representing arbitrary topologies-such as open surfaces and intricate internal structures-while preserving geometric details. Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, yielding superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可见光和红外模态由不同传感器采集，在复杂场景中存在信息不平衡问题，导致跨模态融合不足和检测性能下降。现有方法多在空间域使用Transformer，忽略了在频率域开发Transformer挖掘互补信息的优势。

Method: 提出频率域融合Transformer(FreDFT)，包含多模态频率域注意力(MFDA)挖掘模态间互补信息，频率域前馈层(FDFFL)通过混合尺度频率特征融合增强多模态特征，跨模态全局建模模块(CGMM)消除模态信息不平衡，以及局部特征增强模块(LFEM)加强多模态局部特征表示。

Conclusion: FreDFT通过频率域Transformer有效解决了可见光-红外目标检测中的模态信息不平衡问题，实现了更好的跨模态特征融合和检测性能。

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection has gained sufficient attention due to its detection performance in low light, fog, and rain conditions. However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner. Moreover, a local feature enhancement module (LFEM) is developed to strengthen multimodal local feature representation and promote multimodal feature fusion by using various convolution layers and applying a channel shuffle. Extensive experimental results have verified that our proposed FreDFT achieves excellent performance on multiple public datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个完整的图像筛选解决方案，包括构建包含128k样本的全面数据集，以及引入HCM-GRPO方法来提升多模态大语言模型的图像美学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成性能显著提升，但图像筛选研究稀缺，且多模态大语言模型在图像美学推理方面表现不佳，主要由于缺乏数据和模型推理能力弱。

Method: 收集包含128k样本的全面数据集，采用多种标注方法获取高质量思维链数据；提出HCM-GRPO方法，在GRPO框架中引入困难案例挖掘策略和动态比例精度奖励。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的闭源MLLMs在图像美学推理中表现接近随机猜测，而使用HCM-GRPO的小模型能够超越大规模开源和领先闭源模型的得分。

Conclusion: 通过构建全面数据集和开发HCM-GRPO方法，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的图像美学推理能力，证明了该方法在图像筛选任务中的有效性。

Abstract: The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AV-ConfuseBench基准来测试多模态大语言模型在音频-视觉混淆场景中的表现，发现现有模型因视觉主导推理而难以识别不存在的声音。作者提出了RL-CoMM方法，通过引入大型音频语言模型作为参考，并使用强化学习来改善模型的音频-视觉推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型是否能识别视觉存在但音频缺失的混淆对象，现有模型在音频-视觉混淆场景中表现不佳，主要受视觉主导推理的影响。

Method: 提出了RL-CoMM方法，包含两个阶段：1) 引入大型音频语言模型作为参考模型生成纯音频推理，设计逐步推理奖励函数让MLLMs自我改进音频-视觉推理；2) 引入答案中心置信度优化来减少潜在异构推理差异的不确定性。

Result: 在音频-视觉问答和音频-视觉幻觉任务上的广泛实验表明，RL-CoMM在有限训练数据下比基线模型准确率提高了10~30%。

Conclusion: RL-CoMM方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型在音频-视觉混淆场景中的视觉主导推理问题，显著提升了模型的音频-视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) discern confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent? To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

TL;DR: 提出了GaussMedAct框架，通过多元高斯编码进行医疗动作评估，在CPREval-6k数据集上达到92.1%的Top-1准确率，比ST-GCN基线提升5.9%且仅需10%计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗视觉中细粒度动作评估面临的挑战：缺乏全面数据集、精度要求严格、对快速动作的时空动态建模不足。

Method: 提出GaussMedAct框架，使用多元高斯表示将关节运动投影到时间缩放的多维空间，将动作分解为自适应3D高斯作为token；采用笛卡尔和向量双流策略的混合空间编码有效利用骨骼信息。

Result: 在CPREval-6k数据集上达到92.1% Top-1准确率，比ST-GCN基线提升+5.9%准确率且仅需10% FLOPs；跨数据集实验证实了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GaussMedAct框架通过自适应时空表示学习有效提升了医疗动作分析的性能，在保持实时推理的同时显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.

*Muzhou Yang,Wuzhou Quan,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CABIN是一个半监督学习框架，通过感知-行动-校正的闭环学习过程解决高光谱图像分类中置信度误导的问题。它利用认知不确定性估计识别模糊区域，采用不确定性引导的双重采样策略，并通过细粒度动态分配策略校正噪声监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类中，仅依赖置信度会产生误导，模型容易将高预测分数误认为正确性而缺乏不确定性意识。这导致确认偏差，特别是在稀疏标注或类别不平衡情况下，模型会过度拟合自信的错误并无法泛化。

Method: 1. 感知：通过估计认知不确定性识别可能出错的模糊区域
2. 行动：采用不确定性引导的双重采样策略，选择不确定样本进行探索，同时将自信样本作为稳定伪标签
3. 校正：引入细粒度动态分配策略，将伪标签数据分为可靠、模糊和噪声子集，应用定制化损失函数

Result: 实验结果表明，多种最先进方法在集成CABIN后都受益，提高了标注效率和性能。

Conclusion: CABIN通过认知感知的行为知情学习有效解决了高光谱图像分类中的置信度误导问题，提高了模型的泛化能力和标注效率。

Abstract: Confidence alone is often misleading in hyperspectral image classification, as models tend to mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking awareness of uncertainty. This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出GlobalDiff，首个在全局关节旋转空间操作的扩散框架，通过多级约束方案解决累积误差问题，显著提升共语音运动生成质量。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法基于局部关节旋转，存在层次依赖导致的累积误差，表现为末端效应器的不稳定和不合理运动。

Method: 提出GlobalDiff扩散框架，直接在全局关节旋转空间操作；引入多级约束：关节结构约束（虚拟锚点）、骨架结构约束（骨骼角度一致性）、时间结构约束（多尺度变分编码器）。

Result: 在标准共语音基准测试中，GlobalDiff生成平滑准确的运动，相比当前SOTA性能提升46.0%。

Conclusion: 全局旋转空间操作结合多级约束能有效解决层次误差累积问题，显著改善共语音运动生成质量。

Abstract: Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.

*Yuxiang Duan,Ao Li,Yingqin Li,Luyu Li,Pengwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridPrune是一种新的视觉token剪枝方法，采用"全局引导、局部选择"的两阶段策略，通过文本条件指导动态分配token预算到空间区域，然后在每个区域内进行局部选择，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token剪枝方法主要关注"选择什么"，忽略了"看哪里"的问题，导致空间分配效率低下、位置偏差和保留无关冗余token。受人类视觉系统启发，需要先确定关注区域再精细选择。

Method: GridPrune将剪枝过程分为两步：首先使用文本条件指导动态分配token预算到不同空间区域，然后在每个预算区域内进行局部选择，替代全局Top-K机制。

Result: 在LLaVA-NeXT-7B上，GridPrune仅使用11.1%的token就能保持96.98%的完整性能，在相同剪枝率下比最佳基线方法性能提升2.34%。

Conclusion: GridPrune通过模拟人类视觉系统的两阶段处理策略，有效解决了现有剪枝方法的空间分配效率问题，在各种MLLM架构上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.

Motivation: 探索如何让大型语言模型理解骨架数据并区分不同动作，解决LLM作为识别器时的骨架理解和动作区分问题。

Method: 提出SUGAR范式：1) 使用大规模视频模型生成视觉和运动信息作为知识库；2) 通过先验知识监督骨架学习生成离散表示；3) 使用预训练LLM理解这些表示并生成动作目标和描述；4) 引入Temporal Query Projection模块建模长序列骨架信号。

Conclusion: SUGAR成功地将LLM与骨架数据结合，通过视觉-运动知识监督实现了有效的动作识别和描述，在零样本场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold rich implicit knowledge and powerful transferability. In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决立体深度估计在真实环境中的挑战：动态域偏移、稀疏监督和密集真值标签获取成本高。现有TTA方法依赖静态目标域假设，限制了在持续偏移下的有效性。

Method: RobIA框架包含两个关键组件：(1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE)：参数高效模块，通过轻量级自注意力机制动态路由输入到冻结专家；(2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher：基于PEFT的教师模型，通过补充稀疏手工标签提供密集伪监督。

Conclusion: RobIA框架通过输入特定的灵活性和广泛的监督覆盖，在域偏移下提高了泛化能力，为立体深度估计的持续测试时适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation in real-world environments poses significant challenges due to dynamic domain shifts, sparse or unreliable supervision, and the high cost of acquiring dense ground-truth labels. While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有密集视频描述方法主要依赖隐式建模，使用帧级或碎片化视频特征，无法捕捉事件序列的时序连贯性和视觉上下文的全面语义。

Method: 提出CACMI框架，包含两个核心组件：跨模态帧聚合通过跨模态检索提取时序连贯的事件对齐文本特征；上下文感知特征增强利用查询引导注意力整合视觉动态与伪事件语义。

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook2数据集上的大量实验表明，CACMI在密集视频描述任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CACMI框架通过显式建模视频中的潜在时序特征和文本语料库的语言语义，有效提升了密集视频描述的性能。

Abstract: Dense video captioning jointly localizes and captions salient events in untrimmed videos. Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.

Motivation: 调查当今文本到图像模型在处理逻辑组合方面的系统性失败，特别是在否定、计数和空间关系等核心原语上的性能崩溃问题。

Method: 通过分析三个核心逻辑原语（否定、计数、空间关系）来调查模型性能，追踪失败原因到训练数据缺失、注意力架构不适用和评估指标偏差等关键因素。

Result: 发现模型在单个原语上准确，但在组合时性能急剧下降，暴露严重干扰问题。当前解决方案和简单扩展无法弥合这一差距。

Conclusion: 实现真正的组合性需要在表示和推理方面进行根本性进步，而不是对现有架构进行渐进式调整。

Abstract: The architectural blueprint of today's leading text-to-image models contains a fundamental flaw: an inability to handle logical composition. This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为split-layer的新MLP重构方法，通过将每层分成多个并行分支并用Hadamard乘积整合输出，构建高次多项式空间，显著提升隐式神经表示(INR)的表征能力，同时避免计算开销的二次增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多层感知机(MLP)架构中低维特征空间限制了INR的表征能力，而拓宽MLP会导致计算和内存成本的二次增长，需要一种既能提升表征能力又避免过高计算开销的方法。

Method: 提出split-layer方法，将MLP的每一层划分为多个并行分支，通过Hadamard乘积整合分支输出，构建高次多项式空间来扩展特征空间维度。

Result: 实验表明split-layer显著提升INR性能，在2D图像拟合、2D CT重建、3D形状表示和5D新视角合成等多个任务中超越现有方法。

Conclusion: split-layer通过有效扩展特征空间维度，在不大幅增加计算成本的前提下显著增强了INR的表征能力，为各种逆问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) models signals as continuous functions using neural networks, offering efficient and differentiable optimization for inverse problems across diverse disciplines. However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.

Motivation: 当前公平性增强的检测器往往以牺牲检测精度为代价来改善公平性，这在实际部署中不可行。为了解决这一挑战，需要在保持检测准确性的同时提升模型对不同人口群体的公平性。

Method: 采用双机制协同优化框架：在模型架构层面解耦对人口群体敏感的通道，在特征层面通过全局分布对齐减少整体样本分布与各人口群体分布之间的距离。

Result: 实验结果表明，与其他方法相比，该框架在保持跨领域整体检测精度的同时，提高了群体间和群体内的公平性。

Conclusion: 提出的双机制协同优化框架有效解决了深度伪造检测中公平性与准确性之间的权衡问题，为可信部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Fairness is a core element in the trustworthy deployment of deepfake detection models, especially in the field of digital identity security. Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.

Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效检测完全操纵视频并准确定位部分伪造样本中的深度伪造片段。

Abstract: Recent multimodal deepfake detection methods designed for generalization conjecture that single-stage supervised training struggles to generalize across unseen manipulations and datasets. However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples. Our model, evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrates strong generalization and precise temporal localization.

Conclusion: TubeRMC通过管状条件重建和互约束机制，显著提升了弱监督时空视频定位的性能。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube that corresponds to a given language query in an untrimmed video. This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面部情感识别方法存在两个关键限制：(1) 幻觉推理 - VLMs由于缺乏情感特定知识而生成看似合理但不准确的解释；(2) 情感推理与识别之间的不对齐 - 观察到的面部特征与最终标签之间的连接碎片化。

Method: 三阶段对齐框架：1) 指令微调建立基本情感推理能力；2) 引入以情感和AU标签为奖励信号的强化训练，明确对齐生成推理过程与预测情感；3) 设计数据合成管道，迭代利用前阶段扩展训练数据集，实现可扩展的自我改进。

Result: 在八个标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Facial-R1在FEA中实现了最先进的性能，具有强大的泛化能力和鲁棒的可解释性。

Conclusion: Facial-R1框架有效解决了面部情感分析中的幻觉推理和对齐问题，通过最小监督实现了卓越的性能，并引入了包含17,737个训练样本和1,688个测试样本的FEA-20K基准数据集。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) extends traditional facial emotion recognition by incorporating explainable, fine-grained reasoning. The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.

Motivation: 现有细粒度视觉分类方法在捕捉判别性线索时存在不足，往往引入大量类别无关冗余，无法全面捕获细微的类间差异。

Method: 提出H3Former框架，包含语义感知聚合模块(SAAM)和双曲层次对比损失(HHCL)。SAAM利用多尺度上下文线索构建加权超图，通过超图卷积聚合token特征；HHCL在非欧几里得嵌入空间中施加层次语义约束。

Result: 在四个标准FGVC基准测试上的综合实验验证了H3Former框架的优越性。

Conclusion: H3Former通过高阶语义关系聚合和层次对比学习，有效解决了细粒度视觉分类中的挑战，在多个基准测试上表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) remains a challenging task due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.

Motivation: 现有推理时干预方法在缓解LVLM对象幻觉问题时存在计算开销大的问题，通常需要额外前向传播，限制了在实际延迟敏感部署中的实用性。

Method: 提出RUDDER框架，包含两个关键创新：(1) CARD向量，从单次标准前向传播的自注意力层残差更新中提取视觉证据向量；(2) 贝叶斯启发的自适应门控，根据模型偏离视觉上下文程度执行token级注入。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR等关键幻觉基准测试中，RUDDER达到了与最先进方法相当的性能，同时引入了可忽略的计算延迟。

Conclusion: RUDDER是一种实用有效的改进LVLM可靠性的方法，在不显著牺牲效率的前提下解决了对象幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.

Conclusion: GRAM框架能够有效解决贫民窟分割的区域泛化问题，无需目标区域标注数据即可实现鲁棒性能，支持数据驱动的城市规划。

Abstract: Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

Motivation: 解决LLaVA架构在整合视觉特征时由于文本和视觉模态不匹配而存在的固有缺陷，从新的角度让LLM同时承担语言模型和视觉编码器的双重角色。

Method: 通过三个关键修改实现LLM作为扩展视觉变换器：(1)为视觉模态学习独立的QKV投影，(2)在视觉token上启用双向注意力，(3)结合全局和局部视觉表示。

Result: 在广泛的LLM上进行控制实验表明，LLaViT在多个基准测试中显著优于LLaVA基线方法，甚至超过参数数量翻倍的模型。

Conclusion: LLaViT为视觉语言建模建立了更有效的方法，通过让LLM同时作为视觉编码器，解决了模态不匹配问题。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅保留了CLIP的语义对齐优势，还丰富了特征多样性和跨域结构一致性，有效提升了单域泛化目标检测性能。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for object detection aims to train a model on a single source domain that can generalize effectively to unseen target domains. While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains. Extensive experiments on the diverse weather-driving benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method.

Motivation: 地理空间基础模型在预训练数据不足的环境中往往表现不可靠，需要开发能够识别和应对这些不可靠预测的方法。

Method: 整合三种互补信号：输入空间的OOD检测、嵌入空间的OOD检测和任务特定的预测不确定性，应用于烧伤疤痕分割任务。

Result: OOD分数与特定环境条件下的较低性能相关，基于不确定性的标志有助于丢弃许多表现不佳的预测。失败集中在低海拔区域和大型河流区域，可能是由于预训练数据代表性不足。

Conclusion: SHRUG-FM为在气候敏感应用中更安全、更可解释地部署地理空间基础模型提供了途径，有助于弥合基准性能与现实世界可靠性之间的差距。

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

Method: 提出了AntiDB_Purify评估框架，系统评估现有防御方法在传统图像滤波器和对抗性净化等真实净化威胁下的表现。

Result: 评估结果显示，当前所有防御方法在净化威胁下都无法保持其保护效果，揭示了现有防御提供虚假安全感的严重问题。

Conclusion: 当前防御方法存在明显不足，迫切需要开发更不可察觉和鲁棒的保护机制来保障个性化生成中的用户身份安全。

Abstract: Personalized AI applications such as DreamBooth enable the generation of customized content from user images, but also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly the risk of facial identity leakage. Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.

Abstract: Lane detection is an important topic in the future mobility solutions. Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS. The results demonstrate that SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets. The code will be made available upon publication.

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR v1.5是一个统一的视觉语言框架，通过两阶段解析流程增强文档布局理解和内容识别，在复杂文档场景下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界文档通常具有复杂布局，包含多级表格、嵌入式图像或公式以及跨页结构，这对现有OCR系统构成挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段解析流程：第一阶段使用大型多模态模型联合预测文档布局和阅读顺序；第二阶段在检测区域内进行文本、公式和表格的局部识别。针对复杂表格结构，提出基于视觉一致性的强化学习方案和两个专门模块：图像解耦表格解析和类型引导表格合并。

Result: 在OmniDocBench v1.5上的综合实验表明，MonkeyOCR v1.5实现了最先进的性能，优于PPOCR-VL和MinerU 2.5，在视觉复杂文档场景中表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR v1.5通过统一的视觉语言框架和专门设计的模块，有效解决了复杂文档解析的挑战，在布局理解和内容识别方面均取得显著改进。

Abstract: Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合YOLOMS目标检测模型与大语言模型(LLM)的风力发电机故障智能分析与诊断框架，通过KV映射模块将视觉检测结果转换为结构化文本表示，再由LLM进行语义推理生成可解释的故障分析和维护建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风力发电机故障检测方法主要局限于视觉识别，输出结果缺乏语义可解释性，无法支持维护决策制定。

Method: 采用YOLOMS进行多尺度检测和滑动窗口裁剪以增强故障特征提取，通过轻量级KV映射模块将检测结果转换为包含定性和定量属性的结构化文本表示，再使用领域调优的LLM进行语义推理。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了90.6%的故障检测准确率和平均89%的维护报告准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了诊断结果的可解释性，为风力发电机的运维提供了实用的决策支持。

Abstract: The health condition of wind turbine (WT) components is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable operation. However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

Abstract: Acquiring standard facial planes during routine fetal ultrasound (US) examinations is often challenging due to fetal movement, variability in orientation, and operator-dependent expertise. These factors contribute to inconsistencies, increased examination time, and potential diagnostic bias.
  To address these challenges in the context of facial assessment, we present: 1) GT++, a robust algorithm that estimates standard facial planes from 3D US volumes using annotated anatomical landmarks; and 2) 3DFETUS, a deep learning model that automates and standardizes their localization in 3D fetal US volumes.
  We evaluated our methods both qualitatively, through expert clinical review, and quantitatively. The proposed approach achieved a mean translation error of 4.13 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.93 degrees per plane, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on 3D US volumes. Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce a curated video dataset of laboratory rodents for automatic detection of convulsive events. The dataset contains short (10~s) top-down and side-view video clips of individual rodents, labeled at clip level as normal activity or seizure. It includes 10,101 negative samples and 2,952 positive samples collected from 19 subjects. We describe the data curation, annotation protocol and preprocessing pipeline, and report baseline experiments using a transformer-based video classifier (TimeSformer). Experiments employ five-fold cross-validation with strict subject-wise partitioning to prevent data leakage (no subject appears in more than one fold). Results show that the TimeSformer architecture enables discrimination between seizure and normal activity with an average F1-score of 97%. The dataset and baseline code are publicly released to support reproducible research on non-invasive, video-based monitoring in preclinical epilepsy research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义分割的组织学信息分块方法(HIT)，通过提取前列腺癌WSI中的腺体作为生物学意义明确的输入补丁，改进了多实例学习的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数字病理学流程使用基于网格的分块方法忽略了组织结构，引入了不相关信息并限制了可解释性。需要一种能够提取生物学意义结构的方法。

Method: 使用语义分割从全切片图像中提取腺体作为输入补丁，应用于多实例学习和表型分析。在ProMPT队列的137个样本上训练，在ICGC-C和TCGA-PRAD队列的760个WSI中提取了38万个腺体。

Result: 腺体级别Dice得分为0.83±0.17；将检测上皮-间质转化和MYC相关基因拷贝数变异的多实例学习模型AUC提高了10%；识别出15个腺体簇，其中多个与癌症复发、致癌突变和高Gleason评分相关。

Conclusion: HIT通过专注于生物学意义结构进行特征提取，提高了多实例学习预测的准确性和可解释性，同时简化了计算。

Abstract: Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Abstract: We present OpenSR-SRGAN, an open and modular framework for single-image super-resolution in Earth Observation. The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference. By turning GAN-based super-resolution into a configuration-driven workflow, OpenSR-SRGAN lowers the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners who wish to experiment with SRGANs, compare models in a reproducible way, and deploy super-resolution pipelines across diverse Earth-observation datasets.

Conclusion: 胰腺表面小叶化可用于2型糖尿病筛查，并可能帮助预测2型糖尿病的早期发病。

Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers的计算需求随令牌数量呈二次增长，需要更高效的令牌稀疏化方法来减少计算负担。

Method: 利用令牌嵌入、交互和跨层注意力动态来推断令牌重要性，使用轻量级预测器实现输入特定的令牌优先级排序。

Result: 相比标准ViTs，SPOT实现了高达40%的计算效率提升，同时保持或提高了模型精度。

Conclusion: SPOT提供了一个可插入各种ViT架构的通用框架，能够在不同资源约束下实现计算效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: While Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their computational demands are substantial, scaling quadratically with the number of processed tokens. Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers. Its versatile design supports a range of performance levels adaptable to varying resource constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs, while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Separate-then-Map（StM）的新策略，通过专门的信息映射机制来桥接分别定义和优化的模型，以解决单目视频中动态人类与真实环境交互的重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么整体建模动态场景，要么分别建模场景和背景并引入参数化人类先验，但前者忽略了场景中不同组件（尤其是人类）的独特运动特性，导致重建不完整；后者忽略了分别建模组件之间的信息交换，导致空间不一致和人类-场景边界处的视觉伪影。

Method: 采用Separate-then-Map策略，为每个高斯属性使用共享变换函数来统一分别建模的组件，避免详尽的成对交互，同时确保人类与其周围环境之间的空间和视觉一致性。

Result: 在单目视频数据集上的广泛实验表明，StM在视觉质量和渲染精度方面显著优于现有最先进方法，特别是在具有挑战性的人类-场景交互边界处。

Conclusion: StM策略通过引入专门的信息映射机制，有效解决了分别建模组件之间的空间不一致和视觉伪影问题，在动态人类与真实环境交互的重建任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with real-world environments from monocular videos is an important and challenging task. Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings. Extensive experiments on monocular video datasets demonstrate that StM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and rendering accuracy, particularly at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

Abstract: Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

Conclusion: 本文首次在学术界开源了代码到风格图像生成方法，通过数值风格代码实现了新颖、一致的视觉风格生成，为艺术创作提供了更简单高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

TL;DR: OmniVGGT是一个能够有效利用任意数量几何模态的3D基础模型框架，通过GeoAdapter编码深度和相机参数，采用零初始化卷积注入几何信息，并引入随机多模态融合策略，在深度估计、多视角立体重建和相机姿态估计等任务上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D基础模型大多只使用RGB输入，忽略了容易获得的几何线索（如相机内参、外参和深度图），限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出GeoAdapter模块使用零初始化卷积将深度和相机参数编码到空间基础模型中，同时引入随机多模态融合策略，在训练时随机采样模态子集，支持测试时任意数量模态输入。

Result: 在单目/多视角深度估计、多视角立体重建和相机姿态估计任务上优于现有方法，即使仅使用RGB输入也能达到SOTA性能，集成到VLA模型中在机器人任务上获得持续增益。

Conclusion: OmniVGGT能够有效利用几何模态提升3D视觉任务性能，同时保持推理效率，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.

Abstract: Although Sentinel-2 based land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for various environmental monitoring applications, it is a very difficult task due to some key data challenges (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, context information, signature ambiguity). This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的激励机制来减少人类对AI建议的系统性过度依赖，通过行为实验验证该机制能显著降低过度依赖，并强调激励机制设计需要与任务情境和人类-AI互补性相匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在与AI协作决策时存在系统性过度依赖AI建议的问题，即使独立判断能获得更好结果，这削弱了人类-AI互补性的潜力。现有激励机制是导致这种过度依赖的结构性驱动因素。

Method: 基于先前研究识别激励机制问题，提出替代性激励机制来对抗系统性过度依赖，并通过180名参与者的行为实验进行实证评估。

Result: 提出的激励机制显著减少了过度依赖，但研究发现设计不当的激励机制可能扭曲行为、引入意外后果并最终降低性能。

Conclusion: 有效的协作需要转向情境敏感的激励机制设计，激励机制必须与任务情境和人类-AI互补性保持一致，才能提升协作效果和决策质量。

Abstract: Collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) has improved human decision-making across various domains by leveraging the complementary capabilities of humans and AI. Yet, humans systematically overrely on AI advice, even when their independent judgment would yield superior outcomes, fundamentally undermining the potential of human-AI complementarity. Building on prior work, we identify prevailing incentive structures in human-AI decision-making as a structural driver of this overreliance. To address this misalignment, we propose an alternative incentive mechanism designed to counteract systemic overreliance. We empirically evaluate this approach through a behavioral experiment with 180 participants, finding that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces overreliance. We also show that while appropriately designed incentives can enhance collaboration and decision quality, poorly designed incentives may distort behavior, introduce unintended consequences, and ultimately degrade performance. These findings underscore the importance of aligning incentives with task context and human-AI complementarities, and suggest that effective collaboration requires a shift toward context-sensitive incentive design.

### [82] [Co-Designing Multimodal Systems for Accessible Remote Dance Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09658)
*Ujjaini Das,Shreya Kappala,Meng Chen,Mina Huh,Amy Pavel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究通过三个共同设计工作坊，探索了如何为盲人和低视力学习者开发可访问的远程舞蹈教学系统，解决了视频教学中视觉演示无法被BLV学习者看到的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频教学依赖视觉演示，而盲人和低视力学习者无法看到这些内容。虽然音频描述可以增加可访问性，但描述复杂运动（如舞蹈）仍然具有挑战性，需要传达动作的机制、位置、方向以及速度、流畅性和时间安排。

Method: 进行了三个共同设计工作坊（共28名参与者），包括BLV舞者、教练以及声音、触觉和音频描述领域的专家。参与者设计了8个系统，揭示了分阶段学习、构建动作词汇和选择性使用不同模式等共同主题。

Result: 研究发现三个关键设计主题：分阶段学习以分解舞蹈套路、为动作构建词汇表、以及选择性使用不同模式（叙述用于动作结构、声音用于表达、触觉用于空间提示）。

Conclusion: 提出了设计建议，使舞蹈学习对盲人和低视力学习者更加可访问，强调了多模式教学在复杂运动技能学习中的重要性。

Abstract: Videos make exercise instruction widely available, but they rely on visual demonstrations that blind and low vision (BLV) learners cannot see. While audio descriptions (AD) can make videos accessible, describing movements remains challenging as the AD must convey \textit{what} to do (mechanics, location, orientation) and \textit{how} to do it (speed, fluidity, timing). Prior work thus used \textit{multimodal instruction} to support BLV learners with individual simple movements. However, it is unclear how these approaches scale to dance instruction with unique, complex movements and precise timing constraints. To inform accessible remote dance instruction systems, we conducted three co-design workshops (N=28) with BLV dancers, instructors, and experts in sound, haptics, and AD. Participants designed 8 systems revealing common themes: staged learning to dissect routines, crafting vocabularies for movements, and selectively using modalities (narration for movement structure, sound for expression, and haptics for spatial cues). We conclude with design recommendations to make learning dance accessible.

*Zekun Wu,Mayank Jobanputra,Vera Demberg,Jessica Hullman,Anna Maria Feit*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究通过预注册在线实验(N=304)发现，AI生成回答的详细程度和自信程度会影响人们的信念改变。中等自信的详细回答引发最大的信念变化，而高度自信的信息主要导致信念强度调整而非立场反转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成回答在日常工具中的广泛应用，需要了解回答的细节特征和自信语气等微妙因素如何影响人们的信念形成和改变。

Method: 采用预注册在线实验设计，引入信念转换和信念偏移分析框架，量化用户立场变化和信念强度调整，考察AI回答的详细程度和自信程度对信念改变的影响。

Result: 详细且中等自信的回答与最大的整体信念变化相关；高度自信的信息倾向于引发信念偏移但较少导致立场反转；任务类型、先验信念和感知立场一致性进一步调节信念改变的程度和方向。

Conclusion: AI回答的不同属性以微妙但可能具有重要后果的方式与用户信念相互作用，这对LLM驱动系统的设计提出了实践和伦理考量。

Abstract: The growing use of AI-generated responses in everyday tools raises concern about how subtle features such as supporting detail or tone of confidence may shape people's beliefs. To understand this, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment (N = 304) investigating how the detail and confidence of AI-generated responses influence belief change. We introduce an analysis framework with two targeted measures: belief switch and belief shift. These distinguish between users changing their initial stance after AI input and the extent to which they adjust their conviction toward or away from the AI's stance, thereby quantifying not only categorical changes but also more subtle, continuous adjustments in belief strength that indicate a reinforcement or weakening of existing beliefs. Using this framework, we find that detailed responses with medium confidence are associated with the largest overall belief changes. Highly confident messages tend to elicit belief shifts but induce fewer stance reversals. Our results also show that task type (fact-checking versus opinion evaluation), prior conviction, and perceived stance agreement further modulate the extent and direction of belief change. These findings illustrate how different properties of AI responses interact with user beliefs in subtle but potentially consequential ways and raise practical as well as ethical considerations for the design of LLM-powered systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究调查了内容审核员的心理健康状况，发现他们患有PTSD、抑郁、躯体症状和酒精滥用的比例显著高于数据标注员/技术支持人员，并识别出工作场所文化、自动负面思维、持续压力和回避应对等关键风险因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是了解内容审核员在审查令人痛苦的数字内容时的心理健康状况，以及工作环境因素如何影响他们的心理健康结果，而不仅仅是内容暴露本身。

Method: 研究方法包括横断面国际样本（N=166）和美国前瞻性样本（N=45），使用金标准诊断访谈，评估工作场所因素、认知情感个体差异和应对方式。

Result: 结果显示内容审核员的心理健康问题普遍存在（PTSD：25.9-26.3%；抑郁：42.1-48.5%），且比数据标注员/技术支持人员有更高的PTSD严重程度和情绪障碍风险。负面自动思维、持续压力和回避应对是重要预测因素。

Conclusion: 结论强调组织环境和相关个体应对方式在塑造风险中的重要作用，建议采取结构性和技术性干预措施，如限制每日暴露时间、支持性团队文化、减少侵入性记忆的界面功能，以及认知重构和适应性应对培训。

Abstract: Human content moderators (CMs) routinely review distressing digital content at scale. Beyond exposure, the work context (e.g., workload, team structure, and support) may shape mental health outcomes. We examined a cross sectional international CM sample (N = 166) and a U.S. prospective CM sample, including a comparison group of data labelers or tech support workers (N = 45) and gold standard diagnostic interviews. Predictors included workplace factors (e.g., hours per day distressing content, culture), cognitive-affective individual differences, and coping. Across samples, probable diagnoses based on validated clinical cutoffs were elevated (PTSD: 25.9 to 26.3%; depression: 42.1 to 48.5%; somatic symptoms: 68.7 to 89.5%; alcohol misuse: 10.5% to 18.3%). In the U.S. sample, CMs had higher interviewer rated PTSD severity (d = 1.50), likelihood of a current mood disorder (RR = 8.22), and lifetime major depressive disorder (RR = 2.15) compared to data labelers/tech-support workers. Negative automatic thoughts (b = .39 to .74), ongoing stress (b = .27 to .55), and avoidant coping (b = .30 to .34) consistently predicted higher PTSD and depression severity across samples and at 3 month followup. Poorer perceived workplace culture was associated with higher depression (b = -.16 to -.32). These findings strongly implicate organizational context and related individual response styles, not exposure dose alone in shaping risk. We highlight structural and technological interventions such as limits on daily exposure, supportive team culture, interface features to reduce intrusive memories, and training of cognitive restructuring and adaptive coping to support mental health. We also connect implications to adjacent human in the loop data work (e.g., AI red teaming), where similar risks are emerging.

TL;DR: 本研究通过离线注视交互模拟框架评估实时隐私保护技术的有效性，这些技术旨在减少眼动数据中的身份相关信息并提升注视交互效能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前探索了一些实时注视隐私化方法，但未在大数据集上进行验证。需要开发功能性框架来研究实时注视隐私化在已收集离线数据集上的效果。

Method: 提出功能性框架，使用离线数据集研究实时注视隐私化效果；采用极轻量级卡尔曼滤波器框架减少注视信号中的身份相关信息。

Result: 使用识别率评估身份相关信息的减少程度，通过交互期间的信号质量评估注视交互的改进效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效评估实时注视隐私化技术，卡尔曼滤波器框架既能保护隐私又能提升交互性能。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of the real-time privacy-preserving techniques through an offline gaze-based interaction simulation framework. Those techniques aim to reduce the amount of identity-related information in eye-tracking data while improving the efficacy of the gaze-based interaction. Although some real-time gaze privatization methods were previously explored, their validation on the large dataset was not conducted. We propose a functional framework that allows to study the efficacy of real-time gaze privatization on an already collected offline dataset. The key metric used to assess the reduction of identity-related information is the identification rate, while improvements in gaze-based interactions are evaluated through signal quality during interaction. Our additional contribution is the employment of an extremely lightweight Kalman filter framework that reduces the amount of identity-related information in the gaze signal and improves gaze-based interaction performance.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了改进的扩散模型和GAN方法，用于生成个性化的合成注视数据，通过引入用户嵌入和主题特定合成模块来增强模型的主体感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要从随机噪声分布或全局预定义潜在嵌入生成注视数据，而个性化注视序列生成研究较少，需要开发能够保留个体特异性注视信息的方法。

Method: 对扩散模型使用紧凑的用户嵌入来强调每个主体的特征；对GAN方法提出主题特定合成模块，使生成器能够更好地保留个体特异性注视信息。

Result: 改进后的方法在标准眼动追踪信号质量指标（包括空间准确性和精度）上表现更好，提高了合成信号的质量、真实性和主体特异性。

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于定义合成信号质量、真实性和主体特异性，为基于注视的应用开发做出贡献。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning demonstrate the ability to generate synthetic gaze data. However, most approaches have primarily focused on generating data from random noise distributions or global, predefined latent embeddings, whereas individualized gaze sequence generation has been less explored. To address this gap, we revisit two recent approaches based on diffusion and generative adversarial networks (GANs) and introduce modifications that make both models explicitly subject-aware while improving accuracy and effectiveness. For the diffusion-based approach, we utilize compact user embeddings that emphasize per-subject traits. Moreover, for the GAN-based approach, we propose a subject-specific synthesis module that conditioned the generator to retain better idiosyncratic gaze information. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of these modified approaches utilizing standard eye-tracking signal quality metrics, including spatial accuracy and precision. This work helps define synthetic signal quality, realism, and subject specificity, thereby contributing to the potential development of gaze-based applications.

*Yichen Gao,Menghan Hu,Gang Luo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了视障人士和视力正常人士在智能手机触摸屏上通过触觉反馈识别光栅图案的能力差异，发现视障群体在触觉敏感性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过智能手机触摸屏提供触觉反馈，可能帮助盲人理解图表信息，研究旨在比较视障和视力正常人士对触觉光栅的辨别能力。

Method: 招募6名视障参与者和10名视力正常参与者，在无视觉条件下通过手指在触摸屏上滑动来感知振动同步的黑色条纹图案，进行两个实验：检测光栅图案存在性和比较不同频率光栅的宽度。

Result: 视障群体在实验1中准确率显著更高（99.15% vs 84.5%），在实验2中视障群体的最佳性能出现在0.270 cycles/mm（83.3%准确率），接近盲文点间距，而视力正常群体最佳性能在0.963 cycles/mm（70%准确率）。

Conclusion: 基于光栅图案编码的触觉刺激可用于为视障人士呈现可理解的图表，这对人机交互和感官适应研究具有价值。

Abstract: Providing haptic feedback via smartphone touch screen may potentially offer blind people a capability to understand graphs. This study investigated the discrimination performance of haptic gratings in different frequencies, in both visually impaired (VI) and sighted (S) individuals. 6 VI participants and 10 S participants took part in two experiments designed to compare their ability to interpret grating images with a finger swiping across a smartphone touchscreen without vision. The swipe gesture activates phone vibration temporally synchronized with the black stripes. Their tasks were: (1) determining whether a grating pattern is presented on the touchscreen, (2) comparing two different grating frequencies and determining the wider one. Results demonstrated that the VI group exhibited superior tactile sensitivity compared to the S group, as evidenced by their significantly better performance in Experiment 1 (accuracy of 99.15\% vs. 84.5\%). Experiment 2 revealed that the peak performance of VI participants was approximately around 0.270 cycles per mm (83.3\% accuracy), a frequency very similar to Braille dot spacing, while S group peaked around 0.963 cycles per mm (70\% accuracy). The findings suggest that tactile stimulation coded with grating patterns could be potentially used to present interpretable graph for the visually impaired. Such an approach could offer a value to research in human-computer interaction and sensory adaptation.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了人类道德偏好的时间变化对AI对齐的影响，发现在肾脏分配场景中，参与者对相同情境的回应在6-20%的时间内会发生变化，且AI模型的预测性能会随着偏好变化而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI对齐方法假设人类道德偏好是静态的，但实际上偏好会随时间演变。在医疗等高风险领域，这种忽视可能导致严重的个体和社会危害。

Method: 在肾脏分配领域，对400多名参与者进行3-5轮调查，收集他们对假设肾脏移植患者的成对比较回应，分析回应不稳定性和模型不稳定性。

Result: 参与者对相同情境的回应变化率为6-20%，许多参与者的决策模型随时间发生显著变化，简单AI模型的预测性能随偏好变化而下降。

Conclusion: 人类道德偏好的动态变化对AI对齐提出了根本性挑战，需要重新思考对齐对象（对齐什么）以及如何应对偏好随时间变化的问题。

Abstract: Alignment methods in moral domains seek to elicit moral preferences of human stakeholders and incorporate them into AI. This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for "legitimate" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting "response instability"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing "model instability"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training. These findings raise fundamental normative and technical challenges relevant to AI alignment, highlighting the need to better understand the object of alignment (what to align to) when user preferences change significantly over time.

TL;DR: 互联网测量研究面临复杂的伦理挑战，研究人员通过实验室测试、限制速率、建立沟通渠道和依赖导师指导等方式应对隐私、同意、潜在伤害、透明度与安全平衡、伦理边界不确定性和伦理审查障碍等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解互联网测量研究人员在日常研究中如何实际做出伦理决策，填补现有研究对实践层面伦理决策过程认知的空白。

Method: 对欧盟一个互联网测量研究小组的16名研究人员进行访谈，通过主题分析识别主要伦理挑战和应对策略。

Result: 发现研究人员面临五大伦理挑战：隐私与同意问题、意外伤害可能性、透明度与安全和问责的平衡、不确定的伦理边界、伦理审查流程障碍。研究人员主要通过实验室测试、速率限制、明确沟通渠道和依赖导师同事指导来应对。

Conclusion: 互联网测量研究人员的伦理实践表现为工艺知识，其无形劳动对维护负责任的研究实践至关重要，伦理要求因机构、司法管辖区和会议而异，伦理审查委员会往往缺乏评估互联网测量研究的技术知识。

Abstract: Internet measurement research is essential for understanding, improving, and securing Internet infrastructure. However, its methods often involve large-scale data collection and user observation, raising complex ethical questions. While recent research has identified ethical challenges in Internet measurement research and laid out best practices, little is known about how researchers actually make ethical decisions in their research practice. To understand how these practices take shape day-to-day from the perspective of Internet measurement researchers, we interviewed 16 researchers from an Internet measurement research group in the EU. Through thematic analysis, we find that researchers deal with five main ethical challenges: privacy and consent issues, the possibility of unintended harm, balancing transparency with security and accountability, uncertain ethical boundaries, and hurdles in the ethics review process. Researchers address these by lab testing, rate limiting, setting up clear communication channels, and relying heavily on mentors and colleagues for guidance. Researchers express that ethical requirements vary across institutions, jurisdictions and conferences, and ethics review boards often lack the technical knowledge to evaluate Internet measurement research. We also highlight the invisible labor of Internet measurement researchers and describe their ethics practices as craft knowledge, both of which are crucial in upholding responsible research practices in the Internet measurement community.

TL;DR: 该研究调查了20户美国家庭在需求响应计划中的人类建筑交互行为，发现47%的居住者行为动机至少部分源于非热舒适因素，表明仅基于热舒适的行为模型效用有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源扩展、电气化需求增长和极端天气频发，住宅需求响应计划面临挑战，但居住者手动调整行为会削弱其效果。目前缺乏对不适感、日常习惯和其他动机如何影响需求响应计划调整及相关人类建筑交互的正式理解。

Method: 对科罗拉多州和马萨诸塞州的20户家庭进行为期3个月的研究，使用生态瞬时评估在温控器交互和随机时间触发，包括热偏好强度等级评分、7种可能影响热舒适的活动类型变化，以及动机的开放式问题。开发了12个标签对动机响应进行分类并进行统计分析。

Result: 对热环境变化的反应是最常见的动机（220个响应中的118个），但47%的响应至少部分由非热因素驱动。温控器交互触发的生态瞬时评估中，活动水平和服装变化的报告较少，而风扇交互更常见。窗户、窗帘和便携式加热器交互与生态瞬时评估触发方式无显著依赖关系。

Conclusion: 居住者行为模型不能仅基于热舒适，因为近一半的行为动机涉及非热因素。需求响应计划和建筑系统设计需要考虑更广泛的人类建筑交互动机，包括非热舒适因素。

Abstract: The expansion of renewable electricity generation, growing demands due to electrification, greater prevalence of working from home, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, will place new demands on the electric supply and distribution grid. Broader adoption of demand response programs (DRPs) for the residential sector may help meet these challenges; however, experience shows that occupant overrides in DRPs compromises their effectiveness. There is a lack of formal understanding of how discomfort, routines, and other motivations affect DRP overrides and other related human building interactions (HBI). This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months. Participants responded to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) triggered by thermostat interactions and at random times throughout the day. EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort. Changes in activity level and clothing were less likely to be reported when EMAs were triggered by thermostat interactions, while fan interactions were more likely. Windows, shades, and portable heater interactions had no significant dependence on how the EMA was triggered.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PAD（预览-接受-丢弃）的零点击交互范式，利用AI预测来减少计算机用户的精细运动操作，从而降低重复性劳损风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复性劳损影响约五分之一的计算机用户，传统的人体工程学鼠标设计仍需要精细运动操作，存在根本性限制。

Method: 引入PAD交互范式：用户可以通过按键释放时机来预览预测的GUI目标、循环浏览少量排序备选项，并接受或丢弃预测结果。在浏览器邮件客户端和ISO 9241-9键盘预测任务中评估PAD。

Result: 在两个研究中，PAD显著减少了手部运动，当预测准确度与最佳拼写检查器相当时，任务时间与触控板相当。

Conclusion: AI辅助的预测输入可以有效减少计算机用户的手部运动，为缓解重复性劳损提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Repetitive strain injury (RSI) affects roughly one in five computer users and remains largely unresolved despite decades of ergonomic mouse redesign. All such devices share a fundamental limitation: they still require fine-motor motion to operate. This work investigates whether predictive, AI-assisted input can reduce that motion by replacing physical pointing with ranked on-screen suggestions. To preserve user agency, we introduce Preview Accept Discard (PAD), a zero-click interaction paradigm that lets users preview predicted GUI targets, cycle through a small set of ranked alternatives, and accept or discard them via key-release timing. We evaluate PAD in two settings: a browser-based email client and a ISO 9241-9 keyboard-prediction task under varying top-3 accuracies. Across both studies, PAD substantially reduces hand motion relative to trackpad use while maintaining comparable task times with the trackpad only when accuracies are similar to those of the best spell-checkers.

TL;DR: 研究表明，用户更倾向于与持有相同观点的AI助手互动，认为观点一致的AI更值得信赖、更有能力、更温暖、更有说服力，支持AI相似性吸引假说。而性格匹配的影响较弱甚至没有影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI助手日益个性化，但我们对个性化如何影响互动结果和用户感知的理解有限，因此需要研究AI个性化对用户偏好和感知的影响。

Method: 进行了大规模对照实验，1000名参与者与具有特定性格特征和观点立场的AI助手互动。

Result: 参与者一致偏好与持有相同观点的AI模型互动，认为观点一致的AI更值得信赖、更有能力、更温暖、更有说服力。性格匹配的影响较弱，内向参与者甚至认为内向AI更不值得信赖和能力不足。

Conclusion: 观点一致性是AI个性化和用户偏好的核心维度，同时需要更深入地讨论个性化AI的局限性和风险。

Abstract: Interactions with AI assistants are increasingly personalized to individual users. As AI personalization is dynamic and machine-learning-driven, we have limited understanding of how personalization affects interaction outcomes and user perceptions. We conducted a large-scale controlled experiment in which 1,000 participants interacted with AI assistants that took on certain personality traits and opinion stances. Our results show that participants consistently preferred to interact with models that shared their opinions. Participants also found opinion-aligned models more trustworthy, competent, warm, and persuasive, corroborating an AI-similarity-attraction hypothesis. In contrast, we observed no or only weak effects of AI personality alignment, with introvert models rated as less trustworthy and competent by introvert participants. These findings highlight opinion alignment as a central dimension of AI personalization and user preference, while underscoring the need for a more grounded discussion of the limits and risks of personalized AI.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的0.625鲁棒机制，突破了之前0.6的第一价格拍卖限制，通过简单的竞价拍卖和竞争补贴概念，几乎达到了非策略性鲁棒界限0.63。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非货币在线资源分配中，现有机制的最高鲁棒性因子为0.59，无法突破0.6的限制，而理论最佳可达因子为0.63，因此需要开发新机制来缩小这一差距。

Method: 采用简单的拍卖机制：每轮竞标者决定是否请求物品，然后在请求者中随机均匀分配。关键创新是竞争补贴概念，根据竞标者数量调整获胜者的信用支付（当k个竞标者时，获胜者支付与k/(k+1)成比例）。

Result: 新机制实现了0.625的鲁棒性因子，几乎达到了非策略性鲁棒界限0.63。修改后的机制在均衡策略下可获得约0.61的鲁棒保证和最优的1-1/e均衡因子。

Conclusion: 该机制突破了第一价格拍卖的0.6限制，通过竞争补贴概念实现了接近理论最优的鲁棒性，并在广泛的基于拍卖的机制类别中提供了最佳可能界限。

Abstract: A canonical setting for non-monetary online resource allocation is one where agents compete over multiple rounds for a single item per round, with i.i.d. valuations and additive utilities across rounds. With $n$ symmetric agents, a natural benchmark for each agent is the utility realized by her favorite $1/n$-fraction of rounds; a line of work has demonstrated one can robustly guarantee each agent a constant fraction of this ideal utility, irrespective of how other agents behave. In particular, several mechanisms have been shown to be $1/2$-robust, and recent work established that repeated first-price auctions based on artificial credits have a robustness factor of $0.59$, which cannot be improved beyond $0.6$ using first-price and simple strategies. In contrast, even without strategic considerations, the best achievable factor is $1-1/e\approx 0.63$.
  In this work, we break the $0.6$ first-price barrier to get a new $0.625$-robust mechanism, which almost closes the gap to the non-strategic robustness bound. Surprisingly, we do so via a simple auction, where in each round, bidders decide if they ask for the item, and we allocate uniformly at random among those who ask. The main new ingredient is the idea of competitive subsidies, wherein we charge the winning agent an amount in artificial credits that decreases when fewer agents are bidding (specifically, when $k$ agents bid, then the winner pays proportional to $k/(k+1)$, varying the payment by a factor of 2 depending on the competition). Moreover, we show how it can be modified to get an equilibrium strategy with a slightly weaker robust guarantee of $5/(3e) \approx 0.61$ (and the optimal $1-1/e$ factor at equilibrium). Finally, we show that our mechanism gives the best possible bound under a wide class of auction-based mechanisms.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种两阶段模仿学习方法，用于准确近似非线性、可能为集合值的MPC策略，通过将MPC的最优值函数近似集成到一步前瞻损失函数中，改进了传统行为克隆方法。

Conclusion: 仿真结果表明，与行为克隆相比，该方法具有改进的性能，能够更准确地近似非线性MPC策略。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers rigorous safety and performance guarantees but is computationally intensive. Approximate MPC (AMPC) aims to circumvent this drawback by learning a computationally cheaper surrogate policy. Common approaches focus on imitation learning (IL) via behavioral cloning (BC), minimizing a mean-squared-error loss on a collection of state-input pairs. However, BC fundamentally fails to provide accurate approximations when MPC solutions are set-valued due to non-convex constraints or local minima. We propose a two-stage IL procedure to accurately approximate nonlinear, potentially set-valued MPC policies. The method integrates an approximation of the MPC's optimal value function into a one-step look-ahead loss function, and thereby embeds the MPC's constraint and performance objectives into the IL objective.This is achieved by adopting a stabilizing soft constrained MPC formulation, which reflects constraint violations in the optimal value function by combining a constraint tightening with slack penalties. We prove statistical consistency for policies that exactly minimize our IL objective, implying convergence to a safe and stabilizing control law, and establish input-to-state stability guarantees for approximate minimizers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance compared to BC.

Conclusion: 提出的安全滤波器方法能够有效处理输入非线性和时变安全约束，为复杂系统的安全控制提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for ensuring safe operation of systems subject to input nonlinearities and time-varying safety constraints. We formulate robust time-varying control barrier functions by combining two ingredients: (i) time-varying control barrier functions which capture the time-varying safety constraints, and (ii) pointwise-in-time quadratic constraints that bound the nonlinearity. These ingredients are used to design a safety filter. This filter ensures safety while minimally altering the command from a given baseline controller. The safety filter is implemented as the solution of a second-order cone program, which can be efficiently computed online. The approach is demonstrated on a simple car obstacle avoidance scenario.

Conclusion: SPF方法确保安全平滑导航，计算开销最小，在复杂2D和3D环境中通过仿真验证了有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of safe autonomous navigation in unknown obstacle-filled environments using only local sensory information. We propose a smooth feedback controller derived from an unconstrained penalty-based formulation that guarantees safety by construction. The controller modifies an arbitrary nominal input through a closed-form expression. The resulting closed-form feedback has a projection structure that interpolates between the nominal control and its orthogonal projection onto the obstacle boundary, ensuring forward invariance of a user-defined safety margin. The control law depends only on the distance and bearing to obstacles and requires no map, switching, or set construction. When the nominal input is a gradient descent of a navigation potential, we prove that the closed-loop system achieves almost global asymptotic stability (AGAS) to the goal. Undesired equilibria are shown to be unstable under a mild geometric curvature condition, which compares the normal curvature of the obstacle boundary with that of the potential level sets. We refer to the proposed method as SPF (Safe Penalty-based Feedback), which ensures safe and smooth navigation with minimal computational overhead, as demonstrated through simulations in complex 2D and 3D environments.

Abstract: Hybrid assistive systems that integrate functional electrical stimulation (FES) and robotic exoskeletons offer a promising approach for neurorehabilitation. However, control of these systems remains challenging due to actuator redundancy and heterogeneous assistive device constraints. This paper introduces a novel cooperative control architecture based on dynamic allocation to address actuator redundancy in a hybrid FES-exoskeleton system. The proposed approach employs a modular control allocator that redistributes required control torques between FES and exoskeleton actuators in real time, accounting for device-specific limitations and user preferences (e.g., prioritizing one assistive device over another). Within this framework, the high-level controller determines the total assistance level, while the allocator dynamically distributes control effort based on these assistive device-specific considerations. Simulation results and experimental validation demonstrate the method's effectiveness in resolving actuator redundancy in the FES-exoskeleton system while reflecting actuator constraints, indicating its potential for deployment in clinical studies to assess patient acceptance and clinical efficacy.

Abstract: Vessels navigating in confined waters are subject to banking effects, which are hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from pressure differentials between the vessel sides, significantly affecting manoeuvrability and safety. Existing numerical approaches such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can accurately capture these effects but are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time control or estimation. This paper presents a closed-form, first-principles model of banking effects. The model coefficients are identified using physics-informed regression on towing tank experiment data for a scaled container vessel. Validation through Shapley value analysis confirms the significance of the banking terms in reproducing the measured forces and moments. Lastly, the derived coefficients are shown to be non-dimensional, making the model applicable across different scales that preserve vessel geometry.

Abstract: Propellant sloshing is a well-known, but not completely mastered phenomenon in space vehicles. It is particularly critical in both microgravity environments - such as interplanetary spacecraft requiring high pointing stability - and high-g conditions, as encountered during launch, re-entry, and landing. In both cases, sloshing can significantly affect vehicle performance and stability, and must often be explicitly considered in the design of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) subsystem.
  For stability analysis and control design, the most common approach to modeling sloshing is through an equivalent mechanical representation, where the moving propellant is treated as a mechanical system interacting with the rigid (or flexible) spacecraft. Pendulum-based models and mass-spring-damper systems are widely used by control analysts to assess sloshing-induced perturbations on vehicles subjected to persistent non-gravitational acceleration along one of their body axes.
  In this work, we present a rigorous mathematical formulation of pendulum dynamics, starting from a single spherical pendulum attached to a rigid spacecraft. We derive the nonlinear equations of motion for this 8-degree-of-freedom multi-body system, and then extend the formulation to include multiple pendulums, representing multiple sloshing modes within a tank and/or multiple tanks on the same vehicle. Furthermore, we derive the corresponding linearized equations of motion, explicitly accounting for a nominal longitudinal force acting on the vehicle - consistent with the high-g sloshing regime - expressed in either the inertial or body frame. Finally, we demonstrate the mathematical equivalence between the pendulum and mass-spring-damper models and validate the proposed models through time-domain simulation and frequency-domain analysis.

Abstract: Modern aerospace defense systems increasingly rely on autonomous decision-making to coordinate large numbers of interceptors against multiple incoming threats. Conventional weapon-target assignment (WTA) algorithms, including mixed-integer programming and auction-based methods, show limitations in dynamic and uncertain tactical environments where human-like reasoning and adaptive prioritization are required. This paper introduces a large language model (LLM) driven WTA framework that integrates generalized intelligence into cooperative missile guidance. The proposed system formulates the tactical decision process as a reasoning problem, in which an LLM evaluates spatial and temporal relationships among interceptors, targets, and defended assets to generate real-time assignments. In contrast to classical optimization methods, the approach leverages contextual mission data such as threat direction, asset priority, and closing velocity to adapt dynamically and reduce assignment switching. A dedicated simulation environment supports both static and dynamic assignment modes. Results demonstrate improved consistency, adaptability, and mission-level prioritization, establishing a foundation for integrating generalized artificial intelligence into tactical guidance systems.

Abstract: Solar thermal systems (STS) present a promising avenue for low-carbon heat generation, with a well-running system providing heat at minimal cost and carbon emissions. However, STS can exhibit faults due to improper installation, maintenance, or operation, often resulting in a substantial reduction in efficiency or even damage to the system. As monitoring at the individual level is economically prohibitive for small-scale systems, automated monitoring and fault detection should be used to address such issues. Recent advances in data-driven anomaly detection, particularly in time series analysis, offer a cost-effective solution by leveraging existing sensors to identify abnormal system states.
  Here, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction-based framework for anomaly detection. We evaluate our method on the publicly available PaSTS dataset of operational domestic STS, which features real-world complexities and diverse fault types. Our experiments show that reconstruction-based methods can detect faults in domestic STS both qualitatively and quantitatively, while generalizing to previously unseen systems. We also demonstrate that our model outperforms both simple and more complex deep learning baselines. Additionally, we show that heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation is essential to fault detection performance. Finally, we discuss the engineering overhead required to unlock these improvements and make a case for simple deep learning models.

Result: 增加不对称运行的换流站数量可以降低运行成本，但会导致直流中性电压偏移增加。中性线切换策略能有效缓解电压偏移问题。

Conclusion: 不对称运行策略能够有效降低HVDC电网在单极故障后的运行成本，但需要结合中性线切换策略来控制电压偏移，实现成本与系统安全的平衡。

Abstract: This paper presents a security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) model for HVDC grids that optimizes the asymmetrical operation of bipolar converter stations, i.e., different current injections of the positive and negative converter poles, to minimize operational costs under post-contingency conditions caused by single converter pole outages. The optimization model allows the selection of the number of converter stations that operate asymmetrically. The results indicate that increasing the number of asymmetrical stations lowers operational costs. The analysis also provides insight into the sensitivity of these costs to the level of asymmetrical operation. However, increased asymmetrical operation leads to higher DC neutral voltage offsets that can rise to undesired levels. Imposing limits on these offsets can, in turn, increase operational costs. To mitigate these effects, a neutral line switching (NLS) strategy is proposed for the post-contingency state.

Abstract: As renewable energy generation becomes increasingly integrated into electrical grids, there is a critical need for a paradigm shift toward control schemes that ensure safe, stable, and scalable operations. Hence, in this study, we explore the stability guarantees of a promising control proposal for cyber-physical DC microgrids (MGs), specifically designed to simultaneously achieve proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory to prove global exponential stability by imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the inner(decentralized) and outer(distributed) nested loops, and thus, ensuring that the system reaches the desired (optimal) steady state under appropriate tuning verifying some stability conditions. To prove the effectiveness of our method, our findings are supported by testing the control method in a time-domain simulation case study involving a low-voltage DC microgrid, as well as a small-signal stability analysis

Abstract: Certifying feasibility in decision-making, critical in many industries, can be framed as a constraint satisfaction problem. This paper focuses on characterising a subset of parameter values from an a priori set that satisfy constraints on a directed acyclic graph of constituent functions. The main assumption is that these functions and constraints may be evaluated for given parameter values, but they need not be known in closed form and could result from expensive or proprietary simulations. This setting lends itself to using sampling methods to gain an inner approximation of the feasible domain. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, the paper contributes new methodology to leverage the graph structure for decomposing the problem into lower-dimensional subproblems defined on the respective nodes. The working hypothesis that the Cartesian product of the solution sets yielded by the subproblems will tighten the a priori parameter domain, before solving the full problem defined on the graph, is demonstrated through four case studies relevant to machine learning and engineering. Future research will extend this approach to cyclic graphs and account for parametric uncertainty.

Abstract: We present verifiable conditions for synthesizing a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety under bounded controls. These sufficient conditions ensure the strict compatibility of a control barrier function (CBF) and a control Lyapunov function (CLF) on the exact safe set certified by the barrier. An explicit smooth control Lyapunov-barrier function (CLBF) is then constructed via a patching formula that is provably correct by design. Two examples illustrate the computational procedure, showing that the proposed approach is less conservative than sum-of-squares (SOS)-based compatible CBF-CLF designs.

Abstract: Neural solvers have demonstrated remarkable success in combinatorial optimization, often surpassing traditional heuristics in speed, solution quality, and generalization. However, their efficacy deteriorates significantly when confronted with complex constraints that cannot be effectively managed through simple masking mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce Universal Constrained Preference Optimization (UCPO), a novel plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates preference learning into existing neural solvers via a specially designed loss function, without requiring architectural modifications. UCPO embeds constraint satisfaction directly into a preference-based objective, eliminating the need for meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Leveraging a lightweight warm-start fine-tuning protocol, UCPO enables pre-trained models to consistently produce near-optimal, feasible solutions on challenging constraint-laden tasks, achieving exceptional performance with as little as 1\% of the original training budget.

Abstract: Inspired by infant development, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for autonomous self-exploration in a robotic agent, Baby Sophia, using the BabyBench simulation environment. The agent learns self-touch and hand regard behaviors through intrinsic rewards that mimic an infant's curiosity-driven exploration of its own body. For self-touch, high-dimensional tactile inputs are transformed into compact, meaningful representations, enabling efficient learning. The agent then discovers new tactile contacts through intrinsic rewards and curriculum learning that encourage broad body coverage, balance, and generalization. For hand regard, visual features of the hands, such as skin-color and shape, are learned through motor babbling. Then, intrinsic rewards encourage the agent to perform novel hand motions, and follow its hands with its gaze. A curriculum learning setup from single-hand to dual-hand training allows the agent to reach complex visual-motor coordination. The results of this work demonstrate that purely curiosity-based signals, with no external supervision, can drive coordinated multimodal learning, imitating an infant's progression from random motor babbling to purposeful behaviors.

Abstract: Dynamical system (DS)-based learning from demonstration (LfD) is a powerful tool for generating motion plans in the operation (`task') space of robotic systems. However, the realization of the generated motion plans is often compromised by a ''task-execution mismatch'', where unmodeled dynamics, persistent disturbances, and system latency cause the robot's actual task-space state to diverge from the desired motion trajectory. We propose a novel task-level robust control architecture, L1-augmented Dynamical Systems (L1-DS), that explicitly handles the task-execution mismatch in tracking a nominal motion plan generated by any DS-based LfD scheme. Our framework augments any DS-based LfD model with a nominal stabilizing controller and an L1 adaptive controller. Furthermore, we introduce a windowed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based target selector, which enables the nominal stabilizing controller to handle temporal misalignment for improved phase-consistent tracking. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture on the LASA and IROS handwriting datasets.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了非均匀信息衰减环境中的安全信息采集规划问题，实现了安全性和信息采集效率的平衡。

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed for information-gathering tasks in environments that vary across space and time. Planning informative and safe trajectories in such settings is challenging because information decays when regions are not revisited. Most existing planners model information as static or uniformly decaying, ignoring environments where the decay rate varies spatially; those that model non-uniform decay often overlook how it evolves along the robot's motion, and almost all treat safety as a soft penalty. In this paper, we address these challenges. We model uncertainty in the environment using clarity, a normalized representation of differential entropy from our earlier work that captures how information improves through new measurements and decays over time when regions are not revisited. Building on this, we present Stein Variational Clarity-Aware Informative Planning, a framework that embeds clarity dynamics within trajectory optimization and enforces safety through a low-level filtering mechanism based on our earlier gatekeeper framework for safety verification. The planner performs Bayesian inference-based learning via Stein variational inference, refining a distribution over informative trajectories while filtering each nominal Stein informative trajectory to ensure safety. Hardware experiments and simulations across environments with varying decay rates and obstacles demonstrate consistent safety and reduced information deficits.

Abstract: Amphibians adapt their morphologies and motions to accommodate movement in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Inspired by these biological features, we present PuffyBot, an untethered shape morphing robot capable of changing its body morphology to navigate multiple environments. Our robot design leverages a scissor-lift mechanism driven by a linear actuator as its primary structure to achieve shape morphing. The transformation enables a volume change from 255.00 cm3 to 423.75 cm3, modulating the buoyant force to counteract a downward force of 3.237 N due to 330 g mass of the robot. A bell-crank linkage is integrated with the scissor-lift mechanism, which adjusts the servo-actuated limbs by 90 degrees, allowing a seamless transition between crawling and swimming modes. The robot is fully waterproof, using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fabric to ensure functionality in aquatic environments. The robot can operate untethered for two hours with an onboard battery of 1000 mA h. Our experimental results demonstrate multi-environment locomotion, including crawling on the land, crawling on the underwater floor, swimming on the water surface, and bimodal buoyancy adjustment to submerge underwater or resurface. These findings show the potential of shape morphing to create versatile and energy efficient robotic platforms suitable for diverse environments.

Conclusion: 提出的场景随机化方法能有效提升视觉运动策略的泛化能力，特别是在零样本仿真到真实迁移任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The generalization ability of visuomotor policy is crucial, as a good policy should be deployable across diverse scenarios. Some methods can collect large amounts of trajectory augmentation data to train more generalizable imitation learning policies, aimed at handling the random placement of objects on the scene's horizontal plane. However, the data generated by these methods still lack diversity, which limits the generalization ability of the trained policy. To address this, we investigate the performance of policies trained by existing methods across different scene layout factors via automate the data generation for those factors that significantly impact generalization. We have created a more extensively randomized dataset that can be efficiently and automatically generated with only a small amount of human demonstration. The dataset covers five types of manipulators and two types of grippers, incorporating extensive randomization factors such as camera pose, lighting conditions, tabletop texture, and table height across six manipulation tasks. We found that all of these factors influence the generalization ability of the policy. Applying any form of randomization enhances policy generalization, with diverse trajectories particularly effective in bridging visual gap. Notably, we investigated on low-cost manipulator the effect of the scene randomization proposed in this work on enhancing the generalization capability of visuomotor policies for zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Audio-VLA是一个多模态机器人操作策略，利用接触音频感知接触事件和动态过程反馈，克服了仅视觉VLA模型的限制，并提出了任务完成率(TCR)指标来系统评估动态操作过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅视觉的VLA模型在感知交互和操作动态过程方面存在根本限制，需要引入音频模态来增强对接触事件和动态过程的感知能力。

Method: 使用预训练的DINOv2和SigLIP作为视觉编码器，AudioCLIP作为音频编码器，Llama2作为大语言模型骨干，通过LoRA微调实现跨模态理解，并添加多模态投影层对齐不同模态特征。

Result: 在LIBERO、RLBench和两个真实世界任务上的广泛实验表明，Audio-VLA优于仅视觉的对比方法，TCR指标有效量化了动态过程感知能力。

Conclusion: Audio-VLA通过引入音频模态显著提升了机器人操作性能，TCR指标为动态操作过程评估提供了更全面的度量标准。

Abstract: The Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have achieved significant advances in robotic manipulation recently. However, vision-only VLA models create fundamental limitations, particularly in perceiving interactive and manipulation dynamic processes. This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities.

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了在安全关键环境中部署VLA模型时，迫切需要标准化鲁棒性基准和缓解策略。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models revolutionize robotic systems by enabling end-to-end perception-to-action pipelines that integrate multiple sensory modalities, such as visual signals processed by cameras and auditory signals captured by microphones. This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored.
  To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.

Then we evaluate the performance of the DecARt Leg-based robot via extensive simulation and preliminary hardware experiments.

Conclusion: 本研究为可解释和数据驱动的机器人摩擦建模提供了新视角，具有很好的工程应用前景。

Abstract: Friction modeling plays a crucial role in achieving high-precision motion control in robotic operating systems. Traditional static friction models (such as the Stribeck model) are widely used due to their simple forms; however, they typically require predefined functional assumptions, which poses significant challenges when dealing with unknown functional structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a physics-inspired machine learning approach based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) for static friction modeling of robotic joints. The method integrates spline activation functions with a symbolic regression mechanism, enabling model simplification and physical expression extraction through pruning and attribute scoring, while maintaining both high prediction accuracy and interpretability. We first validate the method's capability to accurately identify key parameters under known functional models, and further demonstrate its robustness and generalization ability under conditions with unknown functional structures and noisy data. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real friction data collected from a six-degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator show that the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination greater than 0.95 across various tasks and successfully extracts concise and physically meaningful friction expressions. This study provides a new perspective for interpretable and data-driven robotic friction modeling with promising engineering applicability.

Abstract: Humans are remarkably efficient at learning tasks from demonstrations, but today's imitation learning methods for robot manipulation often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations per task. We investigate two fundamental priors for improving learning efficiency: decomposing manipulation trajectories into sequential alignment and interaction phases, and retrieval-based generalisation. Through 3,450 real-world rollouts, we systematically study this decomposition. We compare different design choices for the alignment and interaction phases, and examine generalisation and scaling trends relative to today's dominant paradigm of behavioural cloning with a single-phase monolithic policy. In the few-demonstrations-per-task regime (<10 demonstrations), decomposition achieves an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency over single-phase learning, with retrieval consistently outperforming behavioural cloning for both alignment and interaction. Building on these insights, we develop Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer (MT3), an imitation learning method based on decomposition and retrieval. MT3 learns everyday manipulation tasks from as little as a single demonstration each, whilst also generalising to novel object instances. This efficiency enables us to teach a robot 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstrator time. Through 2,200 additional real-world rollouts, we reveal MT3's capabilities and limitations across different task families.

Abstract: Recent advances in closed-loop planning benchmarks have significantly improved the evaluation of autonomous vehicles. However, existing benchmarks still rely on rule-based reactive agents such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), which lack behavioral diversity and fail to capture realistic human interactions, leading to oversimplified traffic dynamics. To address these limitations, we present nuPlan-R, a new reactive closed-loop planning benchmark that integrates learning-based reactive multi-agent simulation into the nuPlan framework. Our benchmark replaces the rule-based IDM agents with noise-decoupled diffusion-based reactive agents and introduces an interaction-aware agent selection mechanism to ensure both realism and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we extend the benchmark with two additional metrics to enable a more comprehensive assessment of planning performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reactive agent model produces more realistic, diverse, and human-like traffic behaviors, leading to a benchmark environment that better reflects real-world interactive driving. We further reimplement a collection of rule-based, learning-based, and hybrid planning approaches within our nuPlan-R benchmark, providing a clearer reflection of planner performance in complex interactive scenarios and better highlighting the advantages of learning-based planners in handling complex and dynamic scenarios. These results establish nuPlan-R as a new standard for fair, reactive, and realistic closed-loop planning evaluation. We will open-source the code for the new benchmark.

Abstract: Bolting operations are critical in industrial assembly and in the maintenance of scientific facilities, requiring high precision and robustness to faults. Although robotic solutions have the potential to improve operational safety and effectiveness, current systems still lack reliable autonomy and fault management capabilities. To address this gap, we propose a control framework for dependable robotized bolting tasks and instantiate it on a specific robotic system. The system features a control architecture ensuring accurate driving torque control and active compliance throughout the entire operation, enabling safe interaction even under fault conditions. By designing a multimodal human-robot interface (HRI) providing real-time visualization of relevant system information and supporting seamless transitions between automatic and manual control, we improve operator situation awareness and fault detection capabilities. A high-level supervisor (SV) coordinates the execution and manages transitions between control modes, ensuring consistency with the supervisory control (SVC) paradigm, while preserving the human operator's authority. The system is validated in a representative bolting operation involving pipe flange joining, under several fault conditions. The results demonstrate improved fault detection capabilities, enhanced operator situational awareness, and accurate and compliant execution of the bolting operation. However, they also reveal the limitations of relying on a single camera to achieve full situational awareness.

Abstract: Origami-inspired mechanisms can transform flat sheets into functional three-dimensional dynamic structures that are lightweight, compact, and capable of complex motion. These properties make origami increasingly valuable in robotic and deployable systems. However, accurately simulating their folding behavior and interactions with the environment remains challenging. To address this, we present a design framework for origami mechanism simulation that utilizes MuJoCo's deformable-body capabilities. In our approach, origami sheets are represented as graphs of interconnected deformable elements with user-specified constraints such as creases and actuation, defined through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This framework allows users to generate physically consistent simulations that capture both the geometric structure of origami mechanisms and their interactions with external objects and surfaces. We demonstrate our method's utility through a case study on an origami catapult, where design parameters are optimized in simulation using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and validated experimentally on physical prototypes. The optimized structure achieves improved throwing performance, illustrating how our system enables rapid, simulation-driven origami design, optimization, and analysis.

To accomplish this, we propose an optimization-based approach to plan a path for the UAV at optimal height where the sensors of the UAV can cover the most area and collect data with minimum uncertainty.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

### [125] [An Efficient and Almost Optimal Solver for the Joint Routing-Assignment Problem via Partial JRA and Large-α Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09563)
*Qilong Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖高效的Partial Path Reconstruction (PPR)求解器来解决联合路由分配(JRA)优化问题，通过识别关键项目-占位符对形成简化子问题，显著提高了大规模JRA问题的求解效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的精确MIP求解器虽然能保证最优性，但在大规模实例上计算效率低下，而启发式方法虽然高效但精度有限。需要开发既能保持高精度又具有高计算效率的新方法。

Method: 提出了PPR求解器框架，首先识别关键项目-占位符对形成简化子问题，然后高效求解以改进全局解。结合全局Large-α约束和迭代优化路径，进一步提升了求解质量。

Result: 在n=300、500和1000的基准数据集上，该方法平均偏差为0.00%，几乎达到最优解，同时保持高计算效率，将初始启发式解的偏差减少了一半。

Conclusion: 所提出的PPR框架不仅为JRA问题提供了高效高精度的解决方案，还展现出在TSP及相关优化问题中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) optimization problem simultaneously determines the assignment of items to placeholders and a Hamiltonian cycle that visits each node pair exactly once, with the objective of minimizing total travel cost. Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-α constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.

Abstract: The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) extends the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to reflect the growing use of electric and hybrid vehicles in logistics. Due to the variety of constraints considered in the literature, comparing approaches across different problem variants remains challenging. A minimalistic variant of the EVRP, known as the Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP), was the focus of the CEC-12 competition held during the 2020 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence. This paper presents the competition-winning approach, based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic. The method achieves the best results on the full competition dataset and also outperforms a more recent algorithm published afterward.

Abstract: Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence in that it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.
  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了证明数搜索的大规模并行化，显著提升了游戏求解能力，为复杂游戏分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文研究了音频推理模型（ARMs）的安全性，发现标准推理训练无法防御高级音频越狱攻击，并提出了一种名为Rebellion的鲁棒推理训练方法，能够在保持良性任务性能的同时有效防御音频越狱攻击。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音频推理模型的普及，目前尚无工作研究其对抗越狱攻击的安全性。本文旨在填补这一空白，探索音频推理模型在面对精心设计的音频越狱攻击时的脆弱性及防御方法。

Method: 首先展示标准推理训练对普通音频越狱攻击的防御效果，然后提出简单但有效的高级越狱攻击方法。基于表示漂移的观察，提出了Rebellion鲁棒推理训练方法，训练模型对最坏情况的表示漂移具有鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明：1）Rebellion能够有效防御高级音频越狱攻击，且不影响良性任务性能；2）在准确性与安全性的权衡上显著优于标准推理训练方法。

Conclusion: Rebellion方法为音频推理模型提供了一种有效的安全防护机制，能够在保持模型性能的同时显著提升对抗越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Instilling reasoning capabilities in large models (LMs) using reasoning training (RT) significantly improves LMs' performances. Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于大语言模型的智能体在自主交互中出现的回声现象，即智能体放弃其指定角色而镜像对话伙伴的行为，这种故障在多智能体对话中普遍存在且难以通过单智能体性能预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的智能体自主交互，出现了一类无法从单智能体性能预测的新故障：智能体间对话中的行为漂移。与人类-智能体交互不同，智能体间交互缺乏稳定信号，导致独特的故障模式。

Method: 通过60个智能体间配置、3个领域和2000+次对话的实验，研究回声现象在不同大语言模型提供商中的表现，分析提示影响和对话动态，并引入协议级缓解措施。

Result: 回声现象在三个主要大语言模型提供商中普遍存在，回声率从5%到70%不等，取决于模型和领域。即使在高级推理模型中，回声率也高达32.8%，且不会因增加推理努力而减少。回声随着交互时间增长（实验中7+轮次）而出现。

Conclusion: 智能体间对话中的回声现象是一个普遍且持久的问题，无法通过优化提示完全解决。通过使用结构化响应的协议级缓解措施，可以将回声率降低至9%。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based agents interact autonomously with one another, a new class of failures emerges that cannot be predicted from single agent performance: behavioral drifts in agent-agent conversations (AxA). Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\%$ to $70\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\%$.

TL;DR: 本研究测试了验证导向的编排（自我验证和交叉验证）是否能提高LLMs对辅导对话的定性编码可靠性，结果显示编排使kappa系数提高了58%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs越来越多地用于标注学习交互，但可靠性问题限制了其实用性，需要验证导向的编排来提高标注质量。

Method: 使用30个一对一数学辅导会话的转录文本，比较三种前沿LLMs在三种条件下的表现：未验证标注、自我验证和所有编排配置下的交叉验证，输出结果与盲审的人类裁决进行基准测试。

Result: 编排总体使kappa系数提高了58%。自我验证相对于未验证基线几乎使一致性翻倍，特别是在挑战性辅导动作上获得最大收益。交叉验证平均提高了37%，但存在配对和结构依赖效应。

Conclusion: 验证是学习分析中实现可靠、可扩展的LLM辅助标注的原则性设计杠杆。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to annotate learning interactions, yet concerns about reliability limit their utility. We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human "gold" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication. Results position verification as a principled design lever for reliable, scalable LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics.

Abstract: This position paper argues for the importance of open small AI models in creative independence for interactive art practices. Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components. This paper explores the practical applications and implications of using open small AI models in interactive art, contrasting them with closed-source alternatives.

Abstract: Adversarial patches have emerged as a popular privacy-preserving approach for resisting AI-driven surveillance systems. However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments. This work demonstrates a new pathway toward physically grounded, user-controllable anti-AI systems, highlighting the growing importance of proactive adversarial techniques for privacy protection in the age of ubiquitous AI surveillance.

Abstract: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are critical to patient survival in emergencies, but first responders often face intense cognitive demands in high-stakes situations. AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics. We also present a suite of benchmarks for real-time multimodal keystep recognition and action quality estimation, essential for developing AI support tools for EMS. We hope EgoEMS inspires the research community to push the boundaries of intelligent EMS systems and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

Abstract: The opioid crisis represents a significant moment in public health that reveals systemic shortcomings across regulatory systems, healthcare practices, corporate governance, and public policy. Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks. The dataset and models are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/opioidarchive

Abstract: Hierarchical data pervades diverse machine learning applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis. Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.

Motivation: 为了解决LLMs在跨日历时间推理方面的能力不足，开发一个能够评估LLMs在不同日历系统间进行时间转换和推理的基准测试。

Method: 提出模板驱动的动态实例生成协议，支持在指定公历日期上进行评估；开发了基于工具增强代码生成的Time Agent，利用代码生成来增强跨日历时间推理能力。

Result: 在1960-2060年100年时间跨度上的实验显示，现有SOTA LLMs平均准确率仅34.5%，最高不超过80%；而Time Agent达到95.31%的准确率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 跨日历时间推理对现有LLMs仍具挑战性，主要障碍包括未来日期退化和日历不对称偏差；工具增强代码生成是提升LLMs跨日历时间推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.

Abstract: Emergency responders managing hazardous material HAZMAT incidents face critical, time-sensitive decisions, manually navigating extensive chemical guidelines. We investigate whether today's language models can assist responders by rapidly and reliably understanding critical information, identifying hazards, and providing recommendations.We introduce the Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF), a new benchmark comprising questions on 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from the Emergency Response Guidebook and the PubChem Database. ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges when processing complex queries. Current frameworks such as ReAct are prone to local optimization traps due to their reliance on incremental decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm that fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks through architectural innovation. Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination. We also introduce ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset featuring complex queries that demand sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination capabilities. Additionally, we develop a two-stage training methodology that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), systematically enhancing the Planner's tool selection accuracy and global planning awareness through structured DAG-based planning. When integrated with a capable executor, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the StableToolBench benchmark for complex user queries, demonstrating superior end-to-end execution capabilities and robust handling of intricate multi-tool workflows.

TL;DR: HPR框架通过强大的hinter模型在关键决策点提供概率指导，由高效的practitioner模型执行主要推理步骤，利用分布不一致性减少指标动态识别干预点，在保持相似或更低计算成本的同时实现最先进的效率-准确率权衡。

Motivation: 当前推理时扩展方法通过穷尽采样产生过高计算成本，研究发现大多数下一个令牌预测与正确输出一致，只有少数关键令牌会导致偏差，需要更高效的推理框架。

Method: 提出Hint-Practice Reasoning框架，包含hinter（强大LLM）提供概率指导，practitioner（高效小模型）执行推理步骤，使用分布不一致性减少指标动态识别干预点，在树结构概率空间中迭代更新。

Result: 在算术和常识推理基准测试中，HPR达到与自一致性和MCTS基线相当的性能，同时仅解码1/5的令牌，在保持相似或更低FLOPs的情况下，比现有方法最多提高5.1%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: HPR框架通过选择性干预关键决策点，实现了高效的推理过程，在计算成本和性能之间取得了优越的平衡。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emerging reasoning capabilities, current inference-time expansion methods incur prohibitive computational costs by exhaustive sampling. Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗报告生成系统将报告视为扁平序列，忽视了放射科医生撰写诊断报告的结构化工作流程（描述视觉发现、总结为印象、在临床关键病例中仔细完善陈述），导致描述性和诊断性内容不一致。

Method: 提出RadFlow框架，采用临床基础奖励层次结构：全局层面整合语言流畅性、医学领域正确性和发现与印象之间的跨部分一致性；局部层面强调印象质量；关键感知策略优化机制自适应调节高风险或临床敏感病例的学习。

Result: 在胸部X光和颈动脉超声数据集上的实验表明，RadFlow相比最先进的基线方法持续提高了诊断一致性和整体报告质量。

Conclusion: RadFlow将结构化报告范式转化为强化微调过程，使模型能够生成既语言一致又临床对齐的报告，更好地与真实世界报告实践保持一致。

Abstract: Radiologists compose diagnostic reports through a structured workflow: they describe visual findings, summarize them into impressions, and carefully refine statements in clinically critical cases. However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MuSeR方法有效增强了LLM在医疗领域的上下文感知能力，通过自我评估和精炼机制显著提升了模型性能，为医疗AI应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

Abstract: We investigate how to couple a learnable brain-like'' controller to a cell-like'' Gray--Scott substrate to steer pattern formation with minimal effort. A compact convolutional policy is embedded in a differentiable PyTorch reaction--diffusion simulator, producing spatially smooth, bounded modulations of the feed and kill parameters ($ΔF$, $ΔK$) under a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes Turing-band spectral targets (FFT-based) while penalizing control effort ($\ell_1/\ell_2$) and instability. We compare three regimes: pure reaction--diffusion, NN-dominant, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid achieves reliable, fast formation of target textures: 100% strict convergence in $\sim 165$ steps, matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs.\ 0.434) while using $\sim 15\times$ less $\ell_1$ effort and $>200\times$ less $\ell_2$ power than NN-dominant control. An amplitude sweep reveals a non-monotonic Goldilocks'' zone ($A \approx 0.03$--$0.045$) that yields 100\% quasi convergence in 94--96 steps, whereas weaker or stronger gains fail to converge or degrade selectivity. These results quantify morphological computation: the controller seeds then cedes,'' providing brief, sparse nudges that place the system in the correct basin of attraction, after which local physics maintains the pattern. The study offers a practical recipe for building steerable, robust, and energy-efficient embodied systems that exploit an optimal division of labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization.

Conclusion: RAGFort为RAG系统提供了全面的知识库提取攻击防御，验证了联合保护类内和类间路径的必要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed over proprietary knowledge bases face growing threats from reconstruction attacks that aggregate model responses to replicate knowledge bases. Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining "contrastive reindexing" for inter-class isolation and "constrained cascade generation" for intra-class protection. Experiments across security, performance, and robustness confirm that RAGFort significantly reduces reconstruction success while preserving answer quality, offering comprehensive defense against knowledge base extraction attacks.

Motivation: 现有去噪方法会改变原始数据分布，导致不现实的场景和有偏模型，这在可解释AI中尤其成问题，因为其可解释性依赖于底层数据模式的保真度。

Conclusion: DenoGrad通过任务特定的高质量解决方案作为参考，提供了更精确和自适应的噪声定义，有效提升了可解释AI模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

Abstract: We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in the modern era, traffic signals from various sensors have been playing a significant role in monitoring the states of cities, which provides a strong foundation in ensuring safe travel, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing urban mobility. Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: ProgRAG通过渐进式推理路径扩展和不确定性感知剪枝，有效解决了KG增强LLM中的检索和推理失败问题，显著提升了多跳知识图谱问答的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: 通过有限范围搜索和基于最短路径的启发式更新，可以显著增强启发式搜索的性能，为顺序决策问题提供更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as shortest-path problems, where the objective is to reach a goal state from a given starting state. Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs经常出现对象幻觉问题，错误判断图像中是否存在某些对象。作者认为这主要源于训练过程中高度共现对象之间形成的虚假相关性，导致模型受到视觉上下文影响而产生幻觉对象。

Method: 引入因果分析到LVLMs的对象识别场景，建立结构因果模型(SCM)。开发Causal-HalBench基准，包含反事实样本和全面的因果指标。提出利用专有LVLMs和文本到图像模型生成反事实样本的可扩展流程。

Result: 在主流LVLMs上的评估显示，这些模型都表现出对虚假相关性的敏感性，尽管程度有所不同。

Conclusion: LVLMs确实存在由共现偏差引起的虚假相关性问题，Causal-HalBench能够有效量化这种影响，为评估模型对虚假相关性的鲁棒性提供了系统方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, making erroneous judgments about the presence of objects in images. We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in bidirectional heuristic search have yielded significant theoretical insights and novel algorithms. While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm. Our results demonstrate that each algorithm excels under distinct conditions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

Abstract: Privacy leakage in AI-based decision processes poses significant risks, particularly when sensitive information can be inferred. We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage. Despite computational challenges and simplifying assumptions, our results demonstrate that abductive reasoning enables interpretable privacy auditing, offering a practical pathway to reconcile transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preserving in AI decision-making.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in mathematical reasoning, they still face challenges in formalizing theorems that arise from instantiating abstract structures in concrete settings. With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions. We incorporate LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to ensure both automation and formal correctness. Experiments on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate that SITA effectively formalizes diverse instances grounded in abstract structures.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in various domains. However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for When, Why Not, and What types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is a powerful inductive mechanism, widely used in human cognition and increasingly applied in artificial intelligence. Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains.

Abstract: In the field of Explainable Constraint Solving, it is common to explain to a user why a problem is unsatisfiable. A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small. Our results show our method significantly speeds up the generation of step-wise explanation sequences, while the resulting step-wise explanation has a quality similar to the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Step-wise explanations can explain logic puzzles and other satisfaction problems by showing how to derive decisions step by step. Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.

Abstract: Standpoint logics offer unified modal logic-based formalisms for representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints. At the same time, many non-monotonic reasoning frameworks can be naturally captured using modal logics, in particular using the modal logic S4F. In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how research is conceived, conducted, and communicated across fields from chemistry to biomedicine. This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.

Abstract: We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) system called Regular Games (RG). The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.

Abstract: The rise of agentic systems that combine orchestration, tool use, and conversational capabilities, has been more visible by the recent advent of large language models (LLMs). While open-domain frameworks exist, applying them in private domains remains difficult due to heterogeneous tool formats, domain-specific jargon, restricted accessibility of APIs, and complex governance. Conventional solutions, such as fine-tuning on synthetic dialogue data, are burdensome and brittle under domain shifts, and risk degrading general performance. In this light, we introduce a framework for private-domain multi-agent conversational systems that avoids training and data generation by adopting behavior modeling and documentation. Our design simply assumes an orchestrator, a tool-calling agent, and a general chat agent, with tool integration defined through structured specifications and domain-informed instructions. This approach enables scalable adaptation to private tools and evolving contexts without continual retraining. The framework supports practical use cases, including lightweight deployment of multi-agent systems, leveraging API specifications as retrieval resources, and generating synthetic dialogue for evaluation -- providing a sustainable method for aligning agent behavior with domain expertise in private conversational ecosystems.

### [167] [Probability-Biased Attention over Directed Bipartite Graphs for Long-Tail ICD Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09559)
*Tianlei Chen,Yuxiao Chen,Yang Li,Feifei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于有向二分图编码器的自动化ICD编码方法，通过建模常见代码与罕见代码之间的细粒度共现关系，利用条件概率引导信息从常见代码流向罕见代码，从而解决ICD编码中的长尾分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化ICD编码面临标签空间大（10,000-20,000个代码）和长尾分布的挑战，许多罕见代码缺乏足够的训练数据。需要一种方法来利用常见代码的信息来增强罕见代码的表示。

Method: 构建有向二分图编码器，包含常见代码和罕见代码两个不相交节点集，边仅从常见代码指向罕见代码。使用基于条件概率的偏置来定义连接关系，并将该偏置注入编码器的注意力模块（共现编码）。同时利用大语言模型生成代码描述来丰富初始嵌入。

Result: 在三个自动化ICD编码基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，在长尾分类的关键指标Macro-F1上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过建模代码间的共现关系并利用大语言模型提供的外部知识，提出的方法有效解决了ICD编码中的长尾分布问题，显著提升了罕见代码的分类性能。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

*Todd Morrill,Aahlad Puli,Murad Megjhani,Soojin Park,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了几种基于混合专家模型的离散时间深度生存分析架构，其中一种能够同时实现聚类、校准和预测准确性的目标。研究发现，表达能力更强的专家模型能够为每个患者定制预测，优于依赖固定群体原型的专家模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度混合专家模型在生存分析中虽然能够聚类相似患者，但往往以牺牲校准误差和预测准确性为代价。这是由于混合专家模型施加的限制性归纳偏差，即个体患者的预测必须与其所属群体的预测相似。本文旨在探索是否能够在发现患者群体结构的同时，提高校准和预测准确性。

Method: 引入了多种基于离散时间深度混合专家模型的生存分析架构，比较了不同表达能力专家模型的性能差异。

Result: 研究发现，表达能力更强的专家模型能够为每个患者定制预测，在聚类、校准和预测准确性方面均表现优异，优于依赖固定群体原型的专家模型。

Conclusion: 通过使用表达能力更强的专家模型，可以实现患者群体结构的发现，同时显著提高校准和预测准确性，突破了传统混合专家模型的限制性归纳偏差。

Abstract: Deep mixture-of-experts models have attracted a lot of attention for survival analysis problems, particularly for their ability to cluster similar patients together. In practice, grouping often comes at the expense of key metrics such calibration error and predictive accuracy. This is due to the restrictive inductive bias that mixture-of-experts imposes, that predictions for individual patients must look like predictions for the group they're assigned to. Might we be able to discover patient group structure, where it exists, while improving calibration and predictive accuracy? In this work, we introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) based architectures for survival analysis problems, one of which achieves all desiderata: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. We show that a key differentiator between this array of MoEs is how expressive their experts are. We find that more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform experts that rely on fixed group prototypes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对多智能体强化学习中的非单调值分解进行了动力学系统分析，证明在近似贪婪探索下，违反IGM一致性的零损失平衡点是不稳定鞍点，而IGM一致解是稳定的吸引子。实验表明非单调分解能可靠恢复IGM最优解并优于单调基线。

Motivation: 现有值分解方法要么施加单调性约束限制表达能力，要么采用更复杂的替代方法。本文旨在通过动力学系统分析理解非单调值分解的学习动态，证明其能够可靠收敛到IGM一致解。

Method: 将学习动态建模为连续时间梯度流，分析非单调值分解的稳定性。通过理论证明和实验验证，在合成矩阵游戏和MARL基准测试中进行广泛评估。

Result: 实验证明无约束的非单调分解能可靠恢复IGM最优解，在多个MARL基准测试中一致优于单调基线方法。同时研究了时间差分目标和探索策略的影响。

Conclusion: 非单调值分解是MARL中值分解的有效方法，无需单调性约束即可保证IGM一致性，为未来基于值的MARL算法设计提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Value decomposition is a central approach in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling centralized training with decentralized execution by factorizing the global value function into local values. To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用群平均技术使任何训练好的机器学习模型在测试时获得精确的等变性，无需改变模型结构或训练过程，能显著提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然科学中的机器学习任务具有特定的对称性等变性，但等变方法常因训练困难、期望模型自行学习对称性或实现复杂而未被采用。群平均技术提供了一种简单解决方案。

Method: 在测试时对训练好的模型进行群平均操作，即对模型在对称群上的输出进行平均，成本与群大小成正比，无需改变模型结构或训练过程。

Result: 实验表明群平均总能降低平均评估损失，VRMSE指标提升高达37%，对连续动力学产生视觉上更好的预测结果。

Conclusion: 在常见情况下施加精确对称性没有缺点，群平均是提升模型精度的廉价简单方法，ML4PS社区应考虑采用。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks in the natural sciences are precisely equivariant to particular symmetries. Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.

Conclusion: 该框架为行为健康、教育和数字治疗等领域的人本系统提供了伦理对齐的强化学习方法，旨在推动情感感知和可信个性化系统的研究对话。

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类知识构建的静态数据集成本高、缺乏动态性和真实性，无法有效培养智能体的自适应行为和长期决策能力，需要让智能体直接与环境交互并通过强化学习从经验中学习。

Method: 提出GEF循环框架，将环境扩展方法按任务生成、任务执行和反馈三个阶段进行系统分类和回顾。

Conclusion: 环境作为经验数据生产者对智能体智能发展至关重要，未来需要向更复杂、真实和交互的方向扩展环境，并提出了具体的研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPAttention通过引入原则性结构稀疏性，将多头注意力计算从H个独立的O(N²)计算转化为单个协作的O(N²)计算，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM核心注意力机制中计算复杂度O(H·N²)与计算冗余之间的根本冲突，现有稀疏方法往往以信息完整性为代价换取计算效率。

Method: 采用原则性结构稀疏性范式，将总注意力工作负载划分为平衡的非重叠距离带，为每个头分配唯一片段，强制功能专业化。

Result: 在OLMoE-1B-7B和0.25B-1.75B模型系列上验证，训练吞吐量提升约两倍，性能与标准密集注意力相当，在关键指标上甚至超越，并始终优于Longformer、Reformer和BigBird等代表性稀疏方法。

Conclusion: SPAttention通过重新组织计算任务，从根本上减少了多头注意力的计算复杂度，实现了效率与性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: The design of Large Language Models (LLMs) has long been hampered by a fundamental conflict within their core attention mechanism: its remarkable expressivity is built upon a computational complexity of $O(H \cdot N^2)$ that grows quadratically with the context size ($N$) and linearly with the number of heads ($H$). This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在相关任务间实现高效优化，最终实现无需额外昂贵评估即可直接预测未见参数化昂贵多目标优化问题的解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require solving families of expensive multi-objective optimization problems~(EMOPs) under varying operational conditions. This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习的目标函数缺乏风险敏感性，这在医疗和金融等领域至关重要。为了纳入风险敏感性，需要优化累积奖励分布的特定分位数。

Method: 开发了UCB-QRL算法，这是一种乐观学习算法。在每次迭代中，首先估计转移概率，然后在置信球内优化分位数价值函数。

Result: UCB-QRL在具有S个状态、A个动作、T个回合和H个时域的周期性设置中，获得了高概率遗憾界O((2/κ)^{H+1}H√(SATHlog(2SATH/δ)))，其中κ>0是问题相关的常数。

Conclusion: UCB-QRL算法成功解决了风险敏感的强化学习问题，为分位数目标提供了理论保证的遗憾界。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $τ$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\mathcal O\left((2/κ)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/δ)}\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons. Here, $κ>0$ is a problem-dependent constant that captures the sensitivity of the underlying MDP's quantile value.

Method: 在单个真实表格上进行简单的自监督预训练，并系统地在多个不同数据集上进行预训练和评估，分析数据的关键方面。

Conclusion: 构建跨领域泛化的表格基础模型时，从数据集中构建的任务数量和质量是影响下游性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Deep tabular modelling increasingly relies on in-context learning where, during inference, a model receives a set of $(x,y)$ pairs as context and predicts labels for new inputs without weight updates. We challenge the prevailing view that broad generalization here requires pre-training on large synthetic corpora (e.g., TabPFN priors) or a large collection of real data (e.g., TabDPT training datasets), discovering that a relatively small amount of data suffices for generalization. We find that simple self-supervised pre-training on just a \emph{single} real table can produce surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks. By systematically pre-training and evaluating on many diverse datasets, we analyze what aspects of the data are most important for building a Tabular Foundation Model (TFM) generalizing across domains. We then connect this to the pre-training procedure shared by most TFMs and show that the number and quality of \emph{tasks} one can construct from a dataset is key to downstream performance.

TL;DR: Boosted GFlowNets通过顺序训练集成模型来解决GFlowNets在探索奖励景观时的不平衡问题，每个后续模型优化残差奖励以补偿先前模型已捕获的质量，从而在未充分探索区域重新激活学习信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准GFlowNets在实践中往往难以均匀探索奖励景观：容易到达区域的轨迹主导训练，而难以到达的模式接收消失或无信息的梯度，导致高奖励区域覆盖不足。

Method: 提出Boosted GFlowNets方法，顺序训练GFlowNets集成，每个模型优化残差奖励来补偿先前模型已捕获的质量，在温和假设下确保单调非退化特性。

Result: 在合成多模态基准和肽设计任务中，Boosted GFlowNets实现了显著更好的探索和样本多样性，同时保持了标准轨迹平衡训练的稳定性和简单性。

Conclusion: Boosted GFlowNets通过残差原则有效解决了GFlowNets的探索不平衡问题，改善了高奖励区域的覆盖，同时保持了训练稳定性。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful samplers for compositional objects that, by design, sample proportionally to a given non-negative reward. Nonetheless, in practice, they often struggle to explore the reward landscape evenly: trajectories toward easy-to-reach regions dominate training, while hard-to-reach modes receive vanishing or uninformative gradients, leading to poor coverage of high-reward areas. We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it. Empirically, Boosted GFlowNets achieve substantially better exploration and sample diversity on multimodal synthetic benchmarks and peptide design tasks, while preserving the stability and simplicity of standard trajectory-balance training.

Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在提升Text2SQL LLMs推理能力方面表现出潜力，但性能高度依赖于奖励函数设计，不恰当的奖励会导致奖励黑客问题，即模型利用奖励结构漏洞获得高分而非真正解决问题。

Method: 采用约束强化学习框架，结合自然可解释的奖励和约束信号，在训练过程中动态平衡这些信号之间的权衡。

Result: 在知名Text2SQL数据集上的数值实验证实了该方法相比最先进的RL训练LLMs的改进效果。

Conclusion: 提出的约束RL框架为Text2SQL任务提供了理论保证，并通过实验验证了其优于现有RL方法的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Text2SQL LLMs, especially with advanced algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. However, the performance of these methods is highly sensitive to the design of reward functions. Inappropriate rewards can lead to reward hacking, where models exploit loopholes in the reward structure to achieve high scores without genuinely solving the task. This work considers a constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that incorporates natural and interpretable reward and constraint signals, while dynamically balancing trade-offs among them during the training. We establish the theoretical guarantees of our constrained RL framework and our numerical experiments on the well-known Text2SQL datasets substantiate the improvement of our approach over the state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCR作为二进制散射码模型的泛化，虽然具有更高表示能力且硬件要求更低，但缺乏系统分析，其复杂性被认为超过表达能力提升。本文旨在通过首次全面评估验证MCR的实际价值。

Method: 对MCR进行首次广泛评估，包括容量测量实验、123个数据集的准确性验证，以及硬件实现研究，设计了首个专用加速器。

Result: MCR在容量上超越二进制和整数向量，接近复数表示但内存占用大幅降低；在123个数据集上显示一致准确性提升，能以4倍少内存匹配二进制散射码性能；硬件实现显示速度提升达3个数量级，能耗显著降低。

Conclusion: 尽管MCR操作比二进制散射码更复杂，但其模运算和更高组件精度允许更低维度，配合专用硬件可实现更快、更节能、高精度的替代方案。

Abstract: The modular composite representation (MCR) is a computing model that represents information with high-dimensional integer vectors using modular arithmetic. Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.

Method: 引入FlowCast模型，应用条件流匹配(CFM)方法。与扩散模型不同，CFM学习直接从噪声到数据的映射，能够以更少的函数评估实现快速、高保真的样本生成。

Result: 实验表明FlowCast在预测准确性上建立了新的最先进水平。直接比较显示，在相同架构下，CFM目标比扩散目标更准确且效率显著更高，能够在显著减少采样步数的同时保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作将CFM定位为高维时空预报中一个强大且实用的替代方案，为时间关键应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Radar-based precipitation nowcasting, the task of forecasting short-term precipitation fields from previous radar images, is a critical problem for flood risk management and decision-making. While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.

TL;DR: SPARC是一种单阶段适应方法，用于解决上下文强化学习中的分布外泛化问题，无需在测试时获取显式上下文信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人和控制领域中，智能体在训练时未见的环境上下文中（如不同地形、天气条件）的泛化挑战，特别是分布外设置下的泛化问题。

Method: 提出SPARC方法，通过单阶段训练替代现有的两阶段方法（分别训练上下文编码器和历史适应模块），简化实现和训练过程。

Result: 在高保真赛车模拟器Gran Turismo 7和风扰动的MuJoCo环境中测试，SPARC实现了可靠且鲁棒的分布外泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPARC方法简化了上下文强化学习的训练流程，同时保持了在分布外环境中的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalization to unseen environments is a significant challenge in the field of robotics and control. In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization.

*Houming Wu,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TawPipe是一种拓扑感知的权重流水线并行方法，通过利用分布式集群中的分层带宽来优化通信效率，解决了传统流水线并行中激活通信开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型受限于设备内存和昂贵的设备间通信。虽然流水线并行通过跨设备划分模型来缓解内存压力，但其激活通信开销随序列长度线性增长，限制了长上下文训练的效率。现有的权重传递方法虽然通过传输模型权重而非激活来缓解这一问题，但仍存在冗余的点对点传输和未充分利用的节点内带宽问题。

Method: TawPipe通过以下方式优化通信效率：(i) 基于拓扑对设备进行分组，优化节点内集体通信和节点间点对点通信；(ii) 为每个设备分配固定的模型权重和梯度分片，避免冗余传输；(iii) 将通信与计算重叠以隐藏延迟。与全分片数据并行中使用的全局集体操作不同，TawPipe将大部分通信限制在节点边界内，显著减少了跨节点流量。

Result: 在多达24个GPU上使用LLaMA风格模型进行的广泛实验表明，与最先进的基线方法相比，TawPipe实现了更优的吞吐量和可扩展性。

Conclusion: TawPipe通过利用分布式集群的拓扑结构，有效解决了大型语言模型训练中的通信瓶颈问题，在吞吐量和可扩展性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by limited device memory and costly inter-device communication. Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Sarthak Khanna,Armin Berger,Muskaan Chopra,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于宏观情境检索的金融预测框架，通过检索历史上类似的宏观经济周期来增强预测的稳健性，在分布外测试中表现优于传统多模态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场具有非平稳性，结构性断裂和宏观经济体制转变常导致预测模型在分布外部署时失效。传统多模态方法简单融合数值指标和文本情感，难以适应这种变化。

Method: 引入宏观情境检索框架，在共享相似性空间中联合嵌入宏观指标（CPI、失业率、收益率曲线等）和金融新闻情感，在推理时无需重新训练即可检索历史类似宏观经济周期作为预测依据。

Result: 在17年S&P 500数据上训练，在AAPL和XOM的2024年分布外测试中，显著缩小了CV到OOD性能差距，实现了唯一正向的样本外交易结果（AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61）。

Conclusion: 通过操作化"金融历史不会重演但常常押韵"的原则，证明宏观感知检索能在分布变化下产生稳健、可解释的预测，检索到的邻居形成可解释的证据链，对应可识别的宏观情境。

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary: structural breaks and macroeconomic regime shifts often cause forecasting models to fail when deployed out of distribution (OOD). Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.
  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency. By operationalizing the principle that "financial history may not repeat, but it often rhymes," this work demonstrates that macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change.
  All datasets, models, and source code are publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于三角分布进化策略（TD-ES）的机器人策略优化方法，通过有界三角噪声和中心秩有限差分估计器实现稳定、可并行化的无梯度更新，在PPO预训练后进行TD-ES精炼，显著提升机器人操作任务的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于策略梯度的强化学习方法在优化机器人策略时面临噪声大、梯度信号弱的问题，需要一种更稳定的策略精炼方法。

Method: 提出TD-ES方法，使用有界三角分布噪声进行局部探索，结合中心秩有限差分估计器，采用两阶段流程：PPO预训练后接TD-ES精炼。

Result: 在一系列机器人操作任务中，TD-ES相比PPO将成功率提高了26.5%，并大幅降低了方差。

Conclusion: TD-ES提供了一种简单、计算量小的可靠精炼路径，能够在保持早期样本效率的同时实现稳健的后期性能提升。

Abstract: Improving competent robot policies with on-policy RL is often hampered by noisy, low-signal gradients. We revisit Evolution Strategies (ES) as a policy-gradient proxy and localize exploration with bounded, antithetic triangular perturbations, suitable for policy refinement. We propose Triangular-Distribution ES (TD-ES) which pairs bounded triangular noise with a centered-rank finite-difference estimator to deliver stable, parallelizable, gradient-free updates. In a two-stage pipeline -- PPO pretraining followed by TD-ES refinement -- this preserves early sample efficiency while enabling robust late-stage gains. Across a suite of robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES raises success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and greatly reduces variance, offering a simple, compute-light path to reliable refinement.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在两种对抗性噪声模型下学习布尔函数的能力和限制：恶意噪声（随机破坏示例子集）和恶意噪声（对抗性选择破坏示例子集）。在分布独立设置中，两种噪声模型具有强等价性；而在固定分布设置中，两者存在任意大的分离差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究计算高效算法在对抗性噪声环境下的学习能力和限制，特别关注恶意噪声和恶意噪声这两种具有挑战性的噪声模型，旨在理解不同设置下算法对这些噪声的容忍度。

Method: 通过理论分析比较分布独立和固定分布两种设置下的学习能力，定义并分析忽略矛盾示例（ICE）算法类，构建理论证明和反例来展示不同噪声模型之间的关系。

Result: 在分布独立设置中，恶意噪声和恶意噪声具有强等价性；在固定分布设置中，两者存在任意大的分离差距；对于ICE算法，两种噪声模型在噪声率上等价于2倍因子关系。

Conclusion: 噪声模型之间的关系高度依赖于学习设置，ICE算法为固定分布设置提供了实用的解决方案，但恶意噪声比恶意噪声更具挑战性，需要更高的算法复杂度来应对。

Abstract: We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.
  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $η_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $η_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.
  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $η$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $η/2$-rate nasty noise. We further show that the above factor of two is necessary, again under a standard cryptographic assumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在大型语言模型后训练中应用广泛，由于其通信量小，适合去中心化训练。然而，目前缺乏对去中心化GRPO中安全威胁的研究，特别是对抗攻击的风险。

Method: 提出了在去中心化GRPO中的对抗攻击方法，包括上下文外攻击和上下文内攻击，通过注入恶意token来毒化良性节点。使用数学和编程任务进行实证验证。

Result: 攻击可以轻松毒化良性节点，污染其本地LLM后训练，在50次迭代内攻击成功率可达100%。

Conclusion: 提出了两种防御方法（针对相同模型训练和不同模型训练的场景），防御成功率可达100%，能够有效阻止攻击。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated great utilization in post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种理论解释，说明联合嵌入预测架构（JEPA）为何能够自动聚类时间序列数据的动态机制，认为JEPA通过预测目标隐式学习了系统Koopman算子的不变子空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释JEPA模型在时间序列数据中自动聚类动态机制的神秘能力，建立自监督学习与动力系统理论之间的理论联系。

Method: 提出理论假设并证明理想化JEPA损失最小化时，编码器会表示系统的机制指示函数（即Koopman特征函数），在已知动态的合成数据上验证理论，并分析线性预测器约束的作用。

Result: 验证了约束JEPA的线性预测器为近恒等算子是关键归纳偏置，迫使编码器学习不变特征，揭示了预测器在表示解纠缠中的作用。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了JEPA的关键行为，为现代自监督学习与动力系统理论建立了原则性联系，并为设计更鲁棒和可解释的时间序列模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.

Motivation: 当前深度预测模型虽然性能显著，但大多数方法难以同时提供准确预测和时间动态的可解释性洞察。

Method: 提出CaReTS多任务学习框架，采用双流架构：分类分支学习未来逐步趋势，回归分支估计目标变量最新观测值的相应偏差。设计了具有不确定性感知权重的多任务损失函数，并实例化了四个变体（CaReTS1-4）来整合主流时序建模编码器（CNN、LSTM、Transformer）。

Conclusion: CaReTS框架通过分离宏观趋势和微观偏差，提供了更可解释的预测，在多步时间序列预测问题上表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.

*Ting Cai,Kirthevasan Kandasamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有可行性约束的最佳臂识别问题，提出了一种高效算法，在固定置信度设置下识别具有最高性能的可行臂，并证明了算法的渐近最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的最佳臂识别问题需要考虑额外的可行性约束，且性能和约束的测量通常需要分开进行（如药物发现中的效力和安全性测试），这要求算法不仅要决定拉哪个臂，还要决定测试性能还是可行性。

Method: 提出了一种高效的可行BAI算法，允许决策者选择元组(i,ℓ)，其中i表示臂，ℓ表示测试性能(ℓ=0)或N个可行性约束之一(ℓ∈[N])，算法能够根据问题难度自然适应，通过较差性能或不可行性来消除臂。

Result: 推导了算法的样本复杂度上界，并给出了下界证明算法是渐近最优的(δ→0)，在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明算法优于其他最先进的BAI算法。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效处理具有可行性约束的最佳臂识别问题，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能，为现实应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Best arm identification (BAI) aims to identify the highest-performance arm among a set of $K$ arms by collecting stochastic samples from each arm. In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\ell)$, where $i\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\ell\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \textit{feasible} arm with the \textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-δ$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \textit{asymptotically ($δ\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新算法，能够规避相关统计查询(CSQ)的硬度障碍，在满足因子化假设的分布下，以多项式时间学习两个半空间的交集，而CSQ方法即使在弱学习下也需要拟多项式时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习半空间交集是计算学习理论的核心问题，但即使对于两个半空间，是否能在多项式时间内学习仍然是一个主要开放问题。现有最佳算法运行在拟多项式时间，且已证明这种复杂度对于仅依赖CSQ的算法是不可避免的。

Method: 采用基于更一般统计查询(SQ)的方法，结合改进的Jennrich算法、随机投影矩张量的PCA，以及基于梯度下降的非凸优化框架。利用对边际分布诱导的矩张量结构的严格分析。

Result: 在满足因子化假设的分布下，CSQ方法需要拟多项式时间进行弱学习，而我们的算法实现了多项式时间学习，建立了CSQ和SQ之间的强分离。

Conclusion: 我们的工作证明了在因子化分布下，通过利用更一般的统计查询可以规避CSQ硬度障碍，为学习两个半空间交集提供了多项式时间算法，显著扩展了已知的可处理情况。

Abstract: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $γ$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/γ))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).
  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/γ)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.
  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.

Motivation: 解决监督学习依赖高质量标注数据但人工标注成本高昂的问题，现有LLM标注质量仍不及人类水平。

Method: ACT数据管道：LLM既作为标注者又作为判断者，识别潜在错误，人工仅需审核最可疑的案例，提高标注效率。

Conclusion: ACT方法通过结合LLM标注和人工审核，在保持高质量的同时显著降低标注成本，适用于NLP、CV和多模态领域。

Abstract: Supervised learning relies on high-quality labeled data, but obtaining such data through human annotation is both expensive and time-consuming. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most "suspicious" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs). (2) Through empirical studies, we derive 7 insights on how to enhance annotation quality while efficiently reducing the human cost, and then translate these findings into user-friendly guidelines. (3) We theoretically analyze how to modify the loss function so that models trained on ACT data achieve similar performance to those trained on fully human-annotated data. Our experiments show that the performance gap can be reduced to less than 2% on most benchmark datasets while saving up to 90% of human costs.

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级动态对齐机制，通过从验证器隐藏状态计算转向向量并注入预训练草稿器，显著提升推测解码中的令牌接受率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码的主要限制是草稿器-验证器不对齐，这会限制令牌接受并降低整体效率。预训练草稿器虽然速度较慢，但具有更强的独立生成能力，在草稿延迟相对于验证或通信开销可忽略时更具竞争力。

Method: 引入轻量级动态对齐机制：从验证器隐藏状态计算转向向量，并将其注入预训练草稿器。与蒸馏等现有离线对齐方法相比，该方法计算开销可忽略。

Result: 在标准采样下令牌接受数提升高达35%，在贪婪采样下提升22%，且可适配现有架构和预训练模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升预训练草稿器的接受率，计算开销极小，且能快速应用于现有系统。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates language model inference by separating generation into fast drafting and parallel verification. Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\% under standard sampling and 22\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead. Importantly, our approach can be retrofitted to existing architectures and pretrained models, enabling rapid adoption.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models in sensitive domains has exposed a critical weakness: the inability to ensure that private information can be permanently forgotten. Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于不确定性的检查点选择方法(UGCS)，通过识别困难样本并评估模型在这些样本上的表现来选择最佳检查点，避免了传统方法的高计算成本和不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习微调过程不稳定且方差大，传统检查点选择方法要么计算成本高（验证集评估），要么不可靠（仅依赖最终检查点），需要一种更有效的方法来选择最佳检查点。

Method: UGCS方法通过分析每个样本的不确定性来识别困难问答对，然后根据检查点处理这些困难案例的能力进行排序，通过计算训练窗口内top不确定样本的平均奖励来获得稳定信号。

Result: 在三个数据集和三个大语言模型上的实验表明，该方法能一致性地识别出具有更强泛化能力的检查点，优于依赖训练或验证性能的传统策略。

Conclusion: 能够以低不确定性解决最困难任务的模型是最可靠的，基于不确定性的检查点选择方法提供了有效的模型选择策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning is crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the process is notoriously unstable and exhibits high variance across model checkpoints. In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.

Motivation: 现有公平聚类算法通常具有二次或超二次计算复杂度，无法适用于大规模数据集，需要开发高效的线性时间公平聚类方法。

Method: 提出基于锚点的公平聚类框架：1）使用公平采样策略选择小规模代表性锚点集；2）应用现成公平聚类算法处理锚点；3）通过优化问题构建锚点图，使用ADMM算法传播标签并保持公平性。

Conclusion: AFCF是一个通用、即插即用的框架，能够显著加速现有公平聚类算法，使其适用于大规模数据集，同时保持公平性约束。

Abstract: Fair clustering is crucial for mitigating bias in unsupervised learning, yet existing algorithms often suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, rendering them impractical for large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods, which reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees.

TL;DR: SE-Diff是一种新颖的生理模拟器和经验增强扩散模型，用于生成心电图(ECG)。它通过整合轻量级ODE模拟器和LLM驱动的经验检索策略，解决了现有方法忽视生理模拟知识和临床经验知识的问题。


<details>

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于流的增量去噪模型在生成建模中表现出色，但缺乏严格的逼近理论基础。本文旨在为这类模型建立数学上的严格保证。

Method: 使用拓扑动力学论证证明单步自治流的不可能性定理，然后利用自治流的代数性质，通过组合多个流来逼近保向Lipschitz同胚映射。

Result: 证明了在[0,1]^d上，任何保向Lipschitz同胚映射都可以被最多K_d个流的组合以O(n^{-1/d})的速率逼近。在额外光滑性假设下，逼近速率可以做到与维度无关。

Conclusion: 增量生成是基于流去噪模型实现通用逼近的关键机制，通过线性提升维度可以获得对连续函数和概率测度的结构化通用逼近结果。

Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出M²V-UGAD框架，用于处理图数据中节点属性和结构同时缺失的无监督异常检测问题，通过双路径编码器防止跨视图干扰，并利用硬负例采样缓解插补偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督图异常检测方法假设完整的节点属性和结构信息，但现实场景中常因隐私、收集错误或动态节点到达导致数据缺失。标准插补方法可能修复异常节点使其看起来正常，且缺失属性与边同时存在时会产生跨视图干扰。

Method: 1. 双路径编码器独立重建缺失节点属性和图结构；2. 在联合潜在空间融合和正则化，使正常节点占据紧凑内流形，异常节点位于外壳；3. 采样潜在空间正常区域外的编码解码为真实节点特征和子图，提供硬负例锐化决策边界。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试中，M²V-UGAD在不同缺失率下始终优于现有无监督图异常检测方法。

Conclusion: M²V-UGAD框架有效解决了图数据多重缺失值问题，通过防止跨视图干扰和缓解插补偏差，显著提升了无监督图异常检测性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received increasing attention in recent years, which aims to identify data anomalous patterns utilizing only unlabeled node information from graph-structured data. However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk "repairing" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.

TL;DR: MDMLP-EIA是一种多域动态MLP模型，通过自适应融合双域季节性MLP、能量不变注意力机制和动态容量调整机制，解决了传统MLP方法在时间序列预测中的季节性信号丢失、权重共享容量限制和通道融合不足等问题。

Conclusion: MDMLP-EIA通过创新的多域动态MLP架构，有效解决了传统MLP方法的局限性，在时间序列预测任务中实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scalable and generalizable analysis of brain activity is essential for advancing both clinical diagnostics and cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

Conclusion: 动态阈值策略在理论上和实践上都优于固定阈值方法，能够更好地平衡误报和延迟检测，有效维护模型性能。

Abstract: Existing drift detection methods focus on designing sensitive test statistics. They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.

Abstract: Tabular data is the most abundant data type in the world, powering systems in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond. As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity.

Abstract: This work explores using the physics-inspired AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm to automatically rediscover a fundamental equation in astronomy -- the Equation of the Centre. Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system. Results demonstrate that targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but also highlight further challenges in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when leveraging domain knowledge through tailored biases.

Abstract: We address the general task of learning with a set of candidate models that is too large to have a uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true losses. While the common approach to such challenges is SRM (or regularization) based learning algorithms, we propose a novel learning paradigm that relies on stronger incorporation of empirical data and requires less algorithmic decisions to be based on prior assumptions. We analyze the generalization capabilities of our approach and demonstrate its merits in several common learning assumptions, including similarity of close points, clustering of the domain into highly label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness assumptions of the labeling rule, and contrastive learning assumptions. Our approach allows utilizing such assumptions without the need to know their true parameters a priori.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observed data is an important task, yet it becomes challenging when the data is subject to various external interferences. Most of these interferences are the additional effects of external factors on observed variables. Since these external factors are often unknown, we introduce latent variables to represent these unobserved factors that affect the observed data. Specifically, to capture the causal strength and adjacency information, we propose a new temporal latent variable structural causal model, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients that represent the causal relationships between variables. Considering that expert knowledge can provide information about unknown interferences in certain scenarios, we develop a method that facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge into parameter learning based on Variational Inference, to guide the model estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our proposed method.

Abstract: Protein structure tokenization converts 3D structures into discrete or vectorized representations, enabling the integration of structural and sequence data. Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural "language". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as "structural synonyms". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple "synonym swap" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our study provides fundamental insights into the nature of discrete protein structure representations and introduces a powerful, near-instantaneous method for modeling protein dynamics.

The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了五种主流文本到图像生成模型在种族和性别方面的系统性偏见，发现这些模型普遍编码并放大了社会刻板印象，如护理角色女性化、高管职位白人男性主导等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型在现实应用中广泛使用，但其战略部署引发了负责任的AI管理担忧，特别是关于种族和性别相关刻板印象的复制和放大问题，这可能损害组织伦理。

Method: 对五种最流行的开源模型进行实证研究，使用十个中性职业相关提示生成每个职业100张图像，共5000张图像，由代表不同种族和性别的多样化人类评估者进行评估。

Result: 所有五种模型都编码并放大了明显的社会偏见：护理和护理角色持续女性化，而企业CEO、政治家、医生和律师等高地位职业绝大多数由男性和主要是白人代表。还识别了模型特定模式，如QWEN-Image几乎只关注东亚输出，Kandinsky主导白人个体，SDXL分布相对更广但仍然存在偏见。

Conclusion: 这些结果为AI项目经理和从业者提供了关键见解，使他们能够选择公平的AI模型和定制提示，生成符合负责任AI原则的图像。讨论了这些偏见风险，并提出了在构建负责任的生成AI系统中进行偏见缓解的可操作策略。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are largely used in AI-powered real-world applications and value creation. However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.

Conclusion: 通过分析八个最先进的生成模型，揭示了这些模型未能遵循物理约束的具体方式，为模型进一步改进铺平了道路。

Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的时间序列预测方法使用MSE损失存在两个根本性弱点：点对点误差计算无法捕捉时间关系，且未考虑数据固有噪声。

Method: 引入残差感知损失函数，基于希尔伯特-施密特独立性准则，通过强制残差序列与随机时间序列之间的依赖性来显式建模噪声结构。

Result: 在8个真实世界基准测试和5个领先预测模型上的实验表明预测性能得到改善，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: RI-Loss能够实现更鲁棒的噪声感知表示，为时间序列预测提供了更有效的损失函数。

Abstract: Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

Motivation: 现实应用中强化学习通常面临样本数量有限的问题，导致离线强化学习性能不佳。需要一种新方法来处理有限样本条件下的学习效率问题。

Method: 引入量子度量编码器(QME)，将状态嵌入到更紧凑且有意义的表示中。对于经典数据，QME是可经典模拟的可训练酉嵌入；对于量子数据，可直接在量子硬件上实现。使用SAC和IQL算法验证效果。

Conclusion: QME通过改变状态空间的几何结构来提升离线强化学习性能，低Δ-双曲性特征为开发有限样本条件下的高效离线强化学习方法提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用离散声学标记序列来捕捉动物发声中的时序信息，通过向量量化和gumbel-softmax向量量化从自监督语音模型表示中提取特征，实验表明这些标记序列能够有效区分叫声类型和个体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数计算生物声学研究在提取帧级特征时会在时间轴上平均处理，丢弃了发声内部子单元的序列顺序，而动物发声中的序列结构携带重要的交流信息。

Method: 使用HuBERT嵌入通过向量量化和gumbel-softmax向量量化生成离散声学标记序列，然后使用基于Levenshtein距离的k-最近邻算法进行序列分类。

Result: 对四个生物声学数据集的标记序列进行成对距离分析表明，它们能够区分叫声类型和个体；序列分类实验显示向量量化标记序列在叫声类型和个体分类方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 向量量化的标记序列作为替代特征表示，在利用动物发声中的序列信息方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Animal vocalizations contain sequential structures that carry important communicative information, yet most computational bioacoustics studies average the extracted frame-level features across the temporal axis, discarding the order of the sub-units within a vocalization. This paper investigates whether discrete acoustic token sequences, derived through vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of extracted self-supervised speech model representations can effectively capture and leverage temporal information. To that end, pairwise distance analysis of token sequences generated from HuBERT embeddings shows that they can discriminate call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets. Sequence classification experiments using $k$-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance show that the vector-quantized token sequences yield reasonable call-type and caller classification performances, and hold promise as alternative feature representations towards leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations.

Conclusion: OCE-TS通过有序分类方法有效解决了传统回归模型的不确定性估计和异常值鲁棒性问题，在时间序列预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through Lévy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.

Conclusion: VDT方法有效提升了OOC虚假信息检测的领域适应能力，通过领域不变特征学习和动态适应机制解决了跨领域检测的挑战。

Abstract: Out-of-context misinformation (OOC) is a low-cost form of misinformation in news reports, which refers to place authentic images into out-of-context or fabricated image-text pairings. This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

TL;DR: FedCure是一个创新的半异步联邦学习框架，通过联盟构建和参与感知调度来解决非IID数据下的参与偏差问题，在四个真实数据集上相比基线方法准确率提升高达5.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半异步联邦学习虽然结合了同步训练效率和异步更新灵活性，但存在参与偏差问题，特别是在非IID数据分布下更为严重。分层架构将参与从单个客户端转移到客户端组，进一步加剧了这一问题。现有研究大多关注传统云-端架构，忽视了非IID数据在云-边-客户端层次调度中的关键影响。

Method: FedCure通过三个关键规则运行：(1)偏好规则优化联盟形成，最大化集体利益并建立理论稳定分区以减少非IID导致的性能下降；(2)调度规则结合虚拟队列技术和贝叶斯估计的联盟动态，在确保平均速率稳定性的同时减轻效率损失；(3)资源分配规则基于估计的联盟动态优化客户端CPU频率，在满足延迟要求的同时提升计算效率。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，FedCure相比四种最先进的基线方法，准确率提升高达5.1倍，同时显著提高效率，每轮延迟的变异系数最低为0.0223，并在多样化场景中保持长期平衡。

Conclusion: FedCure通过联盟构建和参与感知调度有效缓解了非IID数据下的参与偏差问题，在准确性和效率方面均表现出显著优势，为分层半异步联邦学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) combines the efficiency of synchronous training with the flexibility of asynchronous updates, it inherently suffers from participation bias, which is further exacerbated by non-IID data distributions. More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的图推理器缺乏对图表示对称性的内置不变性，在节点重索引、边重排序或格式变化时会产生不同的输出，这引发了鲁棒性担忧。

Method: 提出了将图序列化分解为节点标记、边编码和语法的原则性分解方法，在全面的基准测试套件上评估LLM对这些因素变化的鲁棒性，并贡献了一组新的谱任务来进一步评估微调推理器的泛化能力。

Result: 结果显示，较大的（未微调）模型更具鲁棒性。微调降低了节点重标记的敏感性，但可能增加对结构和格式变化的敏感性，同时不能持续提高在未见任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的图推理器在图表示对称性方面存在鲁棒性问题，微调虽然能降低节点重标记敏感性，但可能带来其他敏感性增加，且不能保证泛化能力的提升。

Abstract: While promising, graph reasoners based on Large Language Models (LLMs) lack built-in invariance to symmetries in graph representations. Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

Motivation: Transformers在上下文学习中表现出色，但在强化学习领域，如何更好地利用上下文信息进行任务适应仍是一个挑战。本文旨在通过引入奖励的信念分布来增强transformer在序列决策中的表现。

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)学习低维随机变量来表示奖励的后验分布，将该分布与上下文数据集和查询状态一起作为transformer策略的提示输入。

Result: 在Darkroom、Miniworld和MuJoCo环境中测试，HT在效果和泛化能力方面均优于可比基线方法。

Conclusion: HT方法为基于信念的增强与transformer决策之间搭建了桥梁，展示了在上下文强化学习中整合不确定性信息的潜力。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and sequential decision-making. In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.

Method: PITE首先基于相同治疗下的相似个体定义原型作为聚类中心，然后进行实例到原型匹配，并设计多原型对齐策略使匹配的原型在潜在空间中接近。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，PITE优于13种最先进方法，实现了更准确和稳健的个体治疗效果估计。

Conclusion: PITE通过细粒度的原型级对齐减少分布偏移，同时保留处理组和对照组的局部结构，为个体治疗效果估计提供了有意义的约束。

Abstract: Estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) from observational data is challenging due to confounding bias. Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \textbf{ITE} estimation (\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PITE outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate and robust ITE estimation.

Conclusion: EDGC通过动态梯度压缩有效解决了大语言模型训练中的通信瓶颈问题，在保证性能的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

Abstract: Decentralized cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (DeCMA2B) considers how multiple agents collaborate in a decentralized multi-armed bandit setting. Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information. We also conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Given i.i.d.~samples from an unknown distribution $P$, the goal of distribution learning is to recover the parameters of a distribution that is close to $P$. When $P$ belongs to the class of product distributions on the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^d$, it is known that $Ω(d/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to learn $P$ within total variation (TV) distance $\varepsilon$. We revisit this problem when the learner is also given as advice the parameters of a product distribution $Q$. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to learn $P$ within TV distance $\varepsilon$ that has sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d^{1-η}/\varepsilon^2)$, if $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1 < \varepsilon d^{0.5 - Ω(η)}$. Here, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are the mean vectors of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and no bound on $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1$ is known to the algorithm a priori.

Motivation: 解决核功率k-means的两个关键限制：计算负担大（需要完整核矩阵）和缺乏真实的质心-样本分配学习导致噪声鲁棒性差。

Method: RFF-KPKM使用随机傅里叶特征生成高效低维特征映射，避免完整核矩阵计算；IP-RFF-MKPKM结合可能性隶属度和模糊隶属度优化聚类分配，并支持多核学习。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了核功率k-means的可扩展性和鲁棒性问题，并提供了严格的理论保证，在大规模数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

Result: 跨多个模型和数据集的实证评估表明，ReCalX能最有效地减少扰动特定的错误校准，同时增强解释的鲁棒性和全局重要输入特征的识别能力。

Conclusion: 不确定性校准与基于扰动的解释质量密切相关，ReCalX方法能有效提高解释的可靠性，为模型透明度提供更好的保障。

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of machine-learning models in practice. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的不平衡分类任务仅基于各类别样本数量来衡量不平衡性，忽略了冗余样本和类别学习难度的差异。现有的复杂度量方法（如训练损失和不确定性）需要训练机器学习模型，计算复杂。

Method: 使用数据内在维度（ID）作为易于计算、无需模型的不平衡度量方法，可无缝集成到各种不平衡缓解方法中。

Conclusion: ID是一种有效的模型无关不平衡度量方法，与基数结合使用可进一步提高性能。

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

TL;DR: Panda是一种基于负数据增强的测试时适应方法，通过生成破坏语义内容的负样本来抑制图像损坏相关特征，从而提升预训练视觉语言模型在图像损坏下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时适应方法采用正数据增强，但存在计算开销大和无法解决预测偏差的问题。正数据增强在损坏输入上操作，通常无法消除损坏本身，导致模型在损坏下倾向于预测某些类别。

Method: Panda通过将图像分割为补丁并从共享补丁池中随机组装来生成负增强图像，这些图像保留损坏特定特征但丢弃对象相关信号。然后从原始图像特征中减去这些负样本的平均特征，有效抑制损坏相关成分同时保留类别相关信息。

Result: 实验表明Panda相比正数据增强方法具有更优越的性能，且当与多种测试时适应方法集成时能显著提升其性能。Panda允许在批次内共享增强，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: Panda是一种高效且有效的测试时适应方法，能够显著提升预训练视觉语言模型在图像损坏下的鲁棒性，且易于集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

Motivation: Tanh作为层归一化的替代方法存在正交性、线性和失真问题，导致其可靠性不足，因此需要开发更有效的归一化方法。

Method: 提出Holonorm方法，具有残差连接和非线性特性，能够保持信号的正交性、方向和可逆性，将向量映射到开放单位球中。

Result: Holonorm能够有效防止激活爆炸，提高深度Transformer模型的稳定性，同时作为0到1之间的百分比度量更易于理解模型评估。

Conclusion: Holonorm是softsign函数的广义形式，适合作为归一化函数，在Transformer模型中表现优于Tanh，提供了更好的稳定性和可解释性。

Abstract: Normalization is a key point in transformer training . In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习原子间势能（MLIPs）的性能依赖于训练数据集的大小和多样性，但大型数据集计算成本高昂，小型数据集可能丢失重要原子环境信息。需要一种高效的数据集压缩方法来平衡准确性和成本。

Method: 将原子数据集压缩建模为原子中心环境上的最小集合覆盖（MSC）问题，开发算法识别包含原始数据集最大信息量的最小结构子集，同时剔除冗余信息。

Result: 在GAP-20、TM23和ColabFit的64个数据集上验证，MSC方法能持续保留异常值、保持数据集多样性，并在高压缩率下重现力的长尾分布，优于其他子采样方法。在低数据情况下，基于MSC压缩数据集训练的MLIPs对分布外数据误差更小。

Conclusion: 该方法通过异常值分析解释了性能提升的原因，传统降维方法无法达到类似定量结论。算法已在开源QUESTS包中实现，可用于原子建模中的数据子采样、异常检测和低成本训练改进的MLIPs。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

Motivation: LayerNorm是transformer中的基础组件，但它在Pre-和Post-LayerNorm架构中对学习和记忆化的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 通过分析Pre-和Post-LayerNorm transformers中LayerNorm的作用，识别其对记忆化和学习的影响，并在6个视觉和语言数据集的13个模型上进行验证。

Result: 在Pre-LayerNorm模型中，移除LayerNorm参数会加剧记忆化并破坏学习稳定性；在Post-LayerNorm模型中，移除LayerNorm参数能有效缓解记忆化。早期层的LayerNorm最为关键。

Conclusion: LayerNorm在transformer中塑造记忆化和学习方面扮演着重要角色，其影响因架构类型和层位置而异。

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

Abstract: We present a semi-unified sparse dictionary learning framework that bridges the gap between classical sparse models and modern deep architectures. Specifically, the method integrates strict Top-$K$ LISTA and its convex FISTA-based variant (LISTAConv) into the discriminative LC-KSVD2 model, enabling co-evolution between the sparse encoder and the dictionary under supervised or unsupervised regimes. This unified design retains the interpretability of traditional sparse coding while benefiting from efficient, differentiable training.
  We further establish a PALM-style convergence analysis for the convex variant, ensuring theoretical stability under block alternation. Experimentally, our method achieves 95.6\% on CIFAR-10, 86.3\% on CIFAR-100, and 88.5\% on TinyImageNet with faster convergence and lower memory cost ($<$4GB GPU). The results confirm that the proposed LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv pipeline offers an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for modern deep architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的线性边界传播方法，用于验证针对少像素攻击（ℓ₀-ball扰动空间）的局部鲁棒性，相比现有方法实现了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的局部鲁棒性验证器主要依赖线性边界传播来处理凸扰动空间，但少像素攻击的ℓ₀-ball扰动空间是非凸的，这限制了验证器的可扩展性。

Method: 作者证明了ℓ₀-ball的凸包是其边界框与不对称缩放的ℓ₁-like多面体的交集，并开发了一种精确计算凸包边界的线性边界传播方法。

Result: 该方法在最具挑战性的鲁棒性基准测试中，将最先进的ℓ₀验证器的性能提升了1.24倍到7.07倍，几何平均为3.16倍。

Conclusion: 通过将ℓ₀-ball扰动空间转化为凸包表示，并开发相应的边界传播方法，可以有效提升少像素攻击鲁棒性验证的可扩展性和精度。

Abstract: Few-pixel attacks mislead a classifier by modifying a few pixels of an image. Their perturbation space is an $\ell_0$-ball, which is not convex, unlike $\ell_p$-balls for $p\geq1$. However, existing local robustness verifiers typically scale by relying on linear bound propagation, which captures convex perturbation spaces. We show that the convex hull of an $\ell_0$-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled $\ell_1$-like polytope. The volumes of the convex hull and this polytope are nearly equal as the input dimension increases. We then show a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over the convex hull and is significantly tighter than bound propagations over the bounding box or our $\ell_1$-like polytope. This bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art $\ell_0$ verifier on its most challenging robustness benchmarks by 1.24x-7.07x, with a geometric mean of 3.16.

Abstract: WaveRoll is an interactive JavaScript library that enables comparative visualization and synchronized playback of multiple MIDI piano rolls on a browser. It addresses a specific evaluation need in Automatic Music Transcription (AMT), contrasting multiple MIDI outputs produced from the same input. The library displays multiple MIDI tracks on a single, time-aligned grid with synchronized audio, allowing users to compare pitch and timing, identify missed or extra notes, and observe onset and offset differences, as well as section-level patterns. We expect that such comparisons would assist in model evaluation and error analysis, and help readers to understand the model behavior better.

TL;DR: 提出Video Echoed in Music (VeM)方法，通过分层视频解析和节拍对齐机制，解决视频到音乐生成中的语义对齐和节拍同步问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频到音乐生成方法存在两个关键限制：1）视频细节表示不完整导致弱对齐；2）时间和节奏对应不足，特别是在实现精确节拍同步方面。

Method: 使用潜在音乐扩散模型，采用分层视频解析作为音乐指挥，结合模态特定编码器和故事板引导的交叉注意力机制(SG-CAtt)，通过帧级过渡-节拍对齐器(TB-As)实现视觉场景转换与音乐节拍的动态同步。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在语义相关性和节奏精度方面表现优越，特别是在新构建的视频-音乐配对数据集上。

Conclusion: VeM能够生成具有语义、时间和节奏对齐的高质量配乐，通过分层视频解析和节拍对齐机制有效解决了视频到音乐生成的关键挑战。

Abstract: Video-to-Music generation seeks to generate musically appropriate background music that enhances audiovisual immersion for videos. However, current approaches suffer from two critical limitations: 1) incomplete representation of video details, leading to weak alignment, and 2) inadequate temporal and rhythmic correspondence, particularly in achieving precise beat synchronization. To address the challenges, we propose Video Echoed in Music (VeM), a latent music diffusion that generates high-quality soundtracks with semantic, temporal, and rhythmic alignment for input videos. To capture video details comprehensively, VeM employs a hierarchical video parsing that acts as a music conductor, orchestrating multi-level information across modalities. Modality-specific encoders, coupled with a storyboard-guided cross-attention mechanism (SG-CAtt), integrate semantic cues while maintaining temporal coherence through position and duration encoding. For rhythmic precision, the frame-level transition-beat aligner and adapter (TB-As) dynamically synchronize visual scene transitions with music beats. We further contribute a novel video-music paired dataset sourced from e-commerce advertisements and video-sharing platforms, which imposes stricter transition-beat synchronization requirements. Meanwhile, we introduce novel metrics tailored to the task. Experimental results demonstrate superiority, particularly in semantic relevance and rhythmic precision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语音转换中，需要在准确建模目标说话人音色和韵律的同时，完整保留语义信息。现有方法在内容完整性和目标说话人特征相似度方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 采用基于VITS的端到端架构，整合文本特征编码器处理文本、音素、声调和BERT特征，使用平均池化和注意力机制将帧级SSL特征处理为音素级特征，并加入时长预测器来对齐目标说话人的语速和韵律。

Conclusion: FabasedVC通过有效整合多模态信息和时长预测，成功实现了在保持内容完整性的同时，显著提升与目标说话人的音色、韵律和时长相似度的语音转换效果。

Abstract: In voice conversion (VC), it is crucial to preserve complete semantic information while accurately modeling the target speaker's timbre and prosody. This paper proposes FabasedVC to achieve VC with enhanced similarity in timbre, prosody, and duration to the target speaker, as well as improved content integrity. It is an end-to-end VITS-based VC system that integrates relevant textual modality information, phoneme-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and a duration predictor. Specifically, we employ a text feature encoder to encode attributes such as text, phonemes, tones and BERT features. We then process the frame-level SSL features into phoneme-level features using two methods: average pooling and attention mechanism based on each phoneme's duration. Moreover, a duration predictor is incorporated to better align the speech rate and prosody of the target speaker. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms competing systems in terms of naturalness, similarity, and content integrity.

TL;DR: SACRED-Bench是一个评估LLM在复杂音频攻击下鲁棒性的基准测试，通过语音-音频组合机制（语音重叠、多说话人对话、语音-音频混合）来绕过现有安全防护，实验显示即使是Gemini 2.5 Pro也有66%攻击成功率，作者提出SALMONN-Guard防护模型将攻击成功率降至20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM虽然能够理解语音和非语音音频，但针对复杂音频输入的安全防护不足，存在新的安全风险，需要评估和改进多模态LLM在音频攻击下的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用三种语音-音频组合机制：语音重叠和多说话人对话（将有害提示嵌入良性语音下或旁边）、语音-音频混合（通过非语音音频暗示不安全意图）、多样化口语指令格式（开放式问答、是/否问题）来规避纯文本过滤器。

Result: 实验表明，即使是当前最先进的专有LLM Gemini 2.5 Pro，在SACRED-Bench测试集上仍有66%的攻击成功率，暴露了在跨模态语音-音频组合攻击下的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM需要音频感知的防御机制来确保安全，提出的SALMONN-Guard模型通过联合检查语音、音频和文本来进行安全判断，显著降低了攻击成功率。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled understanding of both speech and non-speech audio, but exposing new safety risks emerging from complex audio inputs that are inadequately handled by current safeguards. We introduce SACRED-Bench (Speech-Audio Composition for RED-teaming) to evaluate the robustness of LLMs under complex audio-based attacks. Unlike existing perturbation-based methods that rely on noise optimization or white-box access, SACRED-Bench exploits speech-audio composition mechanisms. SACRED-Bench adopts three mechanisms: (a) speech overlap and multi-speaker dialogue, which embeds harmful prompts beneath or alongside benign speech; (b) speech-audio mixture, which imply unsafe intent via non-speech audio alongside benign speech or audio; and (c) diverse spoken instruction formats (open-ended QA, yes/no) that evade text-only filters. Experiments show that, even Gemini 2.5 Pro, the state-of-the-art proprietary LLM, still exhibits 66% attack success rate in SACRED-Bench test set, exposing vulnerabilities under cross-modal, speech-audio composition attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose SALMONN-Guard, a safeguard LLM that jointly inspects speech, audio, and text for safety judgments, reducing attack success down to 20%. Our results highlight the need for audio-aware defenses for the safety of multimodal LLMs. The benchmark and SALMONN-Guard checkpoints can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/SACRED-Bench.
