### [1] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat是一个对话驱动的多智能体推理框架，用于零样本食物识别，通过整合视觉语言模型和大语言模型实现协作推理，无需额外训练或标注即可识别未见过的食物类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督模型严重依赖大规模标注数据集，对未见食物类别的泛化能力有限，需要开发无需标注的零样本识别方法。

Method: 采用多智能体对话框架，包含对象感知令牌(OPT)捕获细粒度视觉属性，交互推理智能体(IRA)动态解释上下文线索，通过多轮视觉-文本对话进行协作推理。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，MultiFoodChat在识别准确率和可解释性方面优于现有的无监督和少样本方法。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为智能食品质量检测和分析新范式的潜力，能够灵活理解复杂食物场景而无需额外训练。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从少量非结构化手机图像创建超真实、保持身份特征的3D头像的零样本流水线，通过生成式规范化模块和基于transformer的模型解决现有方法的几何不一致和细节缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在单视图几何不一致和幻觉问题，降低身份保持能力；基于合成数据训练的模型无法捕捉皮肤皱纹和细发等高频细节，限制真实感。

Method: 引入两个关键贡献：(1)生成式规范化模块处理多视图为标准化表示；(2)基于transformer的模型在从真实人物圆顶捕获的高斯溅射头像数据集上训练。采用"捕获、规范化、溅射"流水线。

Result: 从非结构化照片生成具有引人注目的真实感和稳健身份保持的静态四分之三身体头像。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了现有3D头像创建方法在几何一致性和高频细节捕捉方面的局限性，实现了身份保持和超真实感的平衡。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jörg Keckstein,Simon Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于分割子宫内膜异位症中常见视觉表现——暗色子宫内膜植入物的系统，能够分析腹腔镜手术视频并标注检测区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症具有多样的视觉表现且发生在不同体内位置，使其识别非常困难，特别是对于非专科医生。该系统旨在为妇科医生提供辅助诊断支持

Method: 训练了一个能够分割暗色子宫内膜植入物的系统，可分析腹腔镜手术视频，用多色叠加标注识别出的植入区域，并显示检测摘要以改进视频浏览

Result: 系统能够成功识别和标注子宫内膜异位症中的暗色植入物区域

Conclusion: 该系统为妇科医生在诊断子宫内膜异位症时提供了有效的辅助工具，特别是通过视频分析和区域标注功能提高了诊断效率

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [4] [GauSSmart: Enhanced 3D Reconstruction through 2D Foundation Models and Geometric Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14270)
*Alexander Valverde,Brian Xu,Yuyin Zhou,Meng Xu,Hongyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GauSSmart是一种混合方法，将2D基础模型与3D高斯泼溅重建相结合，通过2D分割先验和特征嵌入来增强场景重建的细节和覆盖范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯泼溅方法在大规模数据集上表现良好，但在稀疏覆盖区域难以捕捉精细细节或保持真实感，主要受限于稀疏3D训练数据的固有局限性。

Method: 整合2D计算机视觉技术（凸滤波和DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督），利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入来指导高斯泼溅的密集化和细化。

Result: 在三个数据集上的验证表明，GauSSmart在大多数评估场景中持续优于现有高斯泼溅方法。

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有显著潜力，将2D基础模型与3D重建管道相结合可以克服各自方法的局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

### [5] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出结合传统视觉模型和视觉语言模型的方法来提升遥感图像分析性能，特别是在飞机检测和场景理解任务上，在原始和退化场景下都取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据量大但传统视觉模型需要大量标注数据且缺乏上下文理解能力，视觉语言模型在遥感领域的应用尚未充分探索，需要研究如何结合两者优势。

Method: 将YOLO目标检测模型与LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini等视觉语言模型集成，在标注和未标注的遥感数据以及退化图像场景下进行性能评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数任务上平均MAE改进48.46%，在挑战性条件下表现尤为突出；CLIPScore提升6.17%用于遥感图像综合理解。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型的结合为更先进高效的遥感图像分析铺平了道路，特别是在少样本学习场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

### [6] [Inpainting the Red Planet: Diffusion Models for the Reconstruction of Martian Environments in Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14765)
*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无条件扩散模型的方法来重建火星表面地形，通过训练12000个火星高度图数据集，在重建精度和感知相似度上显著优于传统插值方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星地形数据存在大量缺失值，现有插值方法难以保持几何一致性，需要更先进的深度学习方法来解决火星表面重建问题。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在增强的火星高度图数据集上进行训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，最终固定为128x128分辨率。

Result: 与逆距离加权、克里金法和纳维-斯托克斯算法相比，该方法在重建精度（RMSE提升4-15%）和感知相似度（LPIPS提升29-81%）上均表现更优。

Conclusion: 无条件扩散模型能够有效重建火星表面地形，在精度和视觉质量上显著优于传统方法，为行星科学和虚拟现实应用提供了可靠的地形重建方案。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了一个基于AI的系统，用于检测前列腺癌中的筛状形态，该系统在内部和外部验证中表现出色，甚至超过了专家病理学家的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是一个重要的组织学特征，表明预后不良且不适合主动监测，但目前存在报告不足和观察者间变异性的问题。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习的深度学习模型，在640个前列腺核心针活检切片上进行训练，并在内部和外部队列中进行验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中AUC为0.97，Cohen's kappa为0.81；在外部验证中AUC为0.90，Cohen's kappa为0.55。在88张切片的比较中，模型的表现超过了9位专家病理学家。

Conclusion: 该AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到了病理学家水平，有望提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [8] [Ponimator: Unfolding Interactive Pose for Versatile Human-human Interaction Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14976)
*Shaowei Liu,Chuan Guo,Bing Zhou,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的通用交互动画框架，使用两个条件扩散模型分别处理时间先验和空间先验，支持图像驱动交互动画、反应动画和文本到交互合成等多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近距离人-人交互姿态蕴含丰富的交互动态信息，人类能基于行为先验从这些姿态中推断上下文并预测动态变化。受此启发，作者希望开发一个基于交互姿态先验的通用动画框架。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；姿态生成器利用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。训练数据来自动捕交互数据集中的近距离双人姿态及其时间上下文。

Result: 在多样化数据集和应用上的实证实验证明了姿态先验的普适性以及框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator能够将高质量动捕数据中的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景，支持多种交互动画任务。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

### [9] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NAPPure框架，能够处理非加性对抗扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲），通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数，显著提升模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，对非加性扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲）效果不佳，而这些扰动在现实世界中很常见。

Method: 建立对抗图像生成过程，通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数，提出扩展的对抗净化框架NAPPure。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架能够有效处理非加性对抗扰动，填补了现有对抗净化方法在这一领域的空白。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [10] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Vgent框架，通过图结构表示视频和中间推理步骤，增强大视频语言模型对长视频的理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频处理中上下文窗口限制和长期序列信息保留的挑战，以及现有视频RAG方法存在的时间依赖破坏和无关信息干扰问题

Method: 使用图结构表示视频片段间的语义关系，引入中间推理步骤进行结构化验证，减少检索噪声并聚合跨片段相关信息

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，相比基础模型性能提升3.0%~5.4%，优于最先进的视频RAG方法8.6%

Conclusion: Vgent框架通过图结构表示和中间推理有效提升了长视频理解的准确性和上下文感知能力

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL是一个基于原型的时间学习框架，通过构建共享的1D表示来同步不同场景或生成AI视频，避免了耗时的成对匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步来自不同场景或生成AI的视频具有挑战性，因为存在不同的主体、背景和非线性时间错位。

Method: TPL从预训练模型中提取高维嵌入，构建共享的紧凑1D表示，通过学习统一的原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段。

Result: 实验表明TPL在多个数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，包括细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务。

Conclusion: TPL是首个解决多个生成AI视频同步问题的方法，在多样化的视频同步任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源的Python库，通过为SciPy和scikit-image API提供GPU加速的替代方案，解决了生物图像分析中的可扩展性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的大型2D和3D数据集需要更高效的计算方法，现有工具在可扩展性、GPU加速和现代科学计算工作流集成方面存在局限。

Method: 基于CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM，cubic提供了设备无关的API，当数据在GPU上时自动调度GPU操作，否则在CPU上执行，无缝加速各种图像处理例程。

Result: 通过基准测试和现有去卷积与分割管道的复现，cubic实现了显著的速度提升，同时保持算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重现的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，能够与更广泛的Python科学计算生态系统集成，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析工作流。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

Method: 通过联合优化识别Big Five和HEXACO的方法，利用多模态人类行为数据进行建模。

Result: 在自我介绍视频数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质。

Conclusion: 联合建模Big Five和HEXACO可以改善多模态人类行为的认知，为表观人格识别提供了更全面的方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建误差的AI图像检测方法计算成本高且无法有效捕捉原始图像中的固有噪声特征。

Method: 使用位平面引导的噪声图像生成，结合图像归一化策略，设计最大梯度补丁选择来放大噪声信号，并提出轻量级分类头。

Conclusion: 该方法在AI生成图像检测方面表现出色，具有高准确率、强泛化能力和高效处理速度的优势。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PIA的多模态音频-视觉框架，通过结合语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索来检测现代深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法依赖手动设计的音素-视位对齐阈值、基本帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由GAN、扩散模型和神经渲染技术生成的现代深度伪造内容。

Method: 使用PIA框架，整合音素序列、唇部几何数据和高级面部身份嵌入，通过多模态互补分析识别时间不一致性。

Result: 该方法显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态分析有效解决了传统检测方法在现代深度伪造检测中的局限性。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Motivation: 传统基于帧的OCC系统存在比特率低和处理负载高的问题，而现有的基于事件视觉传感器的OCC系统虽然有所改进，但尚未充分利用EVS的独特特性。

Method: 提出事件间隔调制(EIM)方案，通过调制事件之间的间隔来编码信息；优化EVS参数以适配EIM；实验确定最大调制阶数；基于获得的参数进行传输实验。

Result: 成功在室内环境中实现了28kbps@10米和8.4kbps@50米的传输速率，为基于事件的OCC系统设立了新的比特率基准。

Conclusion: EIM调制方案能够有效利用EVS的独特特性，显著提升基于事件的OCC系统的传输性能，证明了该方法的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高的问题，传统SCR方法在扩展到大规模场景时受限于单个网络容量。

Method: 引入门控网络隐式分类选择子网络，每次推理只激活单个子网络；提出无辅助损失的负载均衡策略(ALF-LB)提高定位精度。

Result: 在剑桥测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可获得高质量渲染结果，显著降低成本同时保持更高精度。

Conclusion: MACE框架为大规模场景应用提供了高效的解决方案，在降低计算成本的同时维持了高精度定位和渲染质量。

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性方面存在困难，尤其是当视频中人物表情和动作变化大、人脸在图像中占比小时，人类对身份变化高度敏感，这成为关键挑战。

Method: 基于强化学习的身份保持奖励引导优化框架，使用人脸身份评分器优化扩散模型，通过反向传播奖励信号加速收敛，提出多角度面部特征池机制和KL散度正则化防止过拟合。

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效提升图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性，无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有方法如VACE和Phantom在动态交互中难以保持多个人类身份的一致性，而跨多个角色的一致身份对于视频生成至关重要。

Method: 构建了一个基于大规模偏好数据集的视频奖励模型，包含人工标注和合成失真数据，然后使用专门为多人类一致性设计的GRPO变体来优化VACE和Phantom模型。

Result: Identity-GRPO在人类一致性指标上比基线方法提高了18.9%，并通过消融研究评估了标注质量和设计选择对策略优化的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为将强化学习与个性化视频生成对齐提供了可行的见解，显著提升了多人类身份保持能力。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MatchAttention机制，通过动态匹配相对位置来解决高分辨率图像跨视图匹配的挑战，结合MatchDecoder和遮挡处理技术，在多个基准测试中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率图像跨视图匹配中的二次复杂度问题和缺乏显式匹配约束的挑战。

Method: 使用MatchAttention机制进行动态相对位置匹配，通过BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样，设计MatchDecoder作为核心组件，并引入门控跨MatchAttention和一致性约束损失来处理遮挡。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中平均误差排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T可在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像，仅使用3GB GPU内存；在KITTI 2012、KITTI 2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法结合了高精度和低计算复杂度，使实时、高分辨率、高精度的跨视图匹配成为可能。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Conclusion: 因果推断是解决组织病理学图像分析中领域偏移问题的有力工具，具有重要潜力

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)虽然在某些多模态任务上表现出色，但仍容易产生幻觉，过度依赖单一模态或记忆训练数据而缺乏对输出的充分基础。

Method: 训练免费的三层对比解码加水印方法：1) 在解码层中选择成熟层和业余层；2) 使用水印相关问题识别视觉基础良好的枢纽层；3) 应用三层对比解码生成最终输出。

Result: 在POPE、MME和AMBER等公开基准测试中，该方法在减少LVLMs幻觉方面达到最先进性能，并生成更具视觉基础的响应。

Conclusion: 提出的三层对比解码加水印方法能有效减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提高输出的视觉基础性，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Motivation: 虹膜生物识别系统易受呈现攻击（如人工眼睛、打印图像、美瞳镜片），但缺乏足够的训练和评估数据集。

Method: 使用多领域图像转换扩散StyleGAN，结合扩散模型和GAN的优势，采用自适应损失函数保持领域一致性。

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN能有效生成高质量合成眼部图像，显著提升呈现攻击检测系统性能，为数据稀缺问题提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Motivation: 主流多模态大语言模型仅通过文本标记的下一个标记预测进行监督，忽略了视觉中心的关键信息，这限制了模型的视觉分析能力。

Method: 引入可学习的模块化任务查询和视觉对齐层，在多个视觉基础模型的监督下激活特定视觉信号，并通过令牌网关掩码协调不同视觉基础模型之间的表示冲突。

Conclusion: VaCo通过视觉中心激活和协调机制有效提升了多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力，为MLLMs的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet

understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

*Dongnam Byun,Jungwon Park,Jumgmin Ko,Changin Choi,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOS方法通过修改CLIP文本嵌入来改善多对象图像生成，解决了对象忽略和混合问题，在人类评估中显著优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在处理多对象提示时经常出现对象忽略或对象混合的问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象等场景下。

Method: 提出DOS方法，基于CLIP嵌入的两个关键观察，在将文本嵌入传递到文本到图像模型之前修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示DOS持续提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。在人类评估中，DOS显著优于四种竞争方法，在四个基准测试中获得26.24%-43.04%更多的投票。

Conclusion: DOS是改善多对象图像生成的实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

*Danish Ali,Ajmal Mian,Naveed Akhtar,Ghulam Mubashar Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DRBD-Mamba模型，一种高效的3D脑肿瘤分割方法，通过双分辨率双向Mamba架构捕获多尺度长程依赖，显著降低计算开销，并在BraTS2023数据集上实现性能提升和15倍效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba模型在脑肿瘤分割中计算开销大，且在不同数据划分下的鲁棒性未被充分探索，需要更高效可靠的解决方案。

Method: 使用空间填充曲线进行3D到1D特征映射，提出门控融合模块自适应整合前向和反向上下文，采用量化块离散化特征以提高鲁棒性，并建立五个系统性数据划分进行严格评估。

Result: 在测试集上，全肿瘤、肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤的Dice分别提升0.10%、1.75%和0.93%；在系统性五折评估中，肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤平均Dice分别提升0.86%和1.45%，同时实现15倍效率提升。

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba模型在保持高分割精度的同时显著提升计算效率，证明了其在脑肿瘤分割中的鲁棒性和实用性优势。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

TL;DR: BoardVision是一个用于主板组装缺陷检测的可复现框架，通过集成YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN模型，并提出轻量级集成方法CTV Voter来平衡精确率和召回率，最终开发了可部署的GUI检测工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在电子制造中，主板组装级缺陷检测研究不足，现有方法主要关注裸板或线路级缺陷，而组装级检测（如缺失螺丝、松动的风扇接线等）缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 使用YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN两种代表性检测器在MiracleFactory数据集上进行基准测试，并提出置信度-时间投票（CTV Voter）集成方法来平衡精确率和召回率。

Result: YOLOv7在精确率上表现优异但召回率不足，Faster R-CNN则相反；CTV Voter集成方法有效平衡了精确率和召回率；在真实扰动下评估了模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了计算机视觉技术如何从基准测试过渡到实际的主板组装制造质量保证应用，并提供了可部署的检测工具。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DCMIL模型，通过双课程对比多实例学习处理全切片图像，无需密集标注即可进行癌症预后预测，在12种癌症类型上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学面临全切片图像计算量大和密集标注稀缺的挑战，现有方法常忽略多放大倍数下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用易到难的渐进表示学习，结合双课程对比多实例学习，直接将千兆像素级全切片图像转换为预后预测。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954患者，1254万图块）上验证，DCMIL优于标准预后模型，能识别细粒度预后相关区域并提供稳健的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: DCMIL有效处理全切片图像，无需密集标注，在癌症预后预测中表现优异，具有生成新生物学见解的潜力。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

*Hui Xiang,Yifan Bian,Li Li,Jingran Wu,Xianguo Zhang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的神经视频压缩框架，结合了帧内和帧间编码，通过自适应编码策略有效处理遮挡和新内容，并采用双向帧压缩设计提升压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容以及帧间误差传播方面存在不足，需要借鉴传统视频编码中的帧内编码思想来解决这些问题。

Method: 构建统一的帧内/帧间编码框架，使用单一模型自适应执行两种编码模式；提出同时两帧压缩设计，利用前向和后向的帧间冗余。

Result: 相比DCVC-RT平均降低10.7%的BD-rate，提供更稳定的帧级码率和质量，同时保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一编码策略有效解决了神经视频压缩中的关键问题，显著提升了压缩效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于深度学习的视频目标检测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但易受通用对抗攻击的影响，需要开发更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 使用核范数正则化促进背景集中的结构化扰动，采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化。

Result: 所提出的攻击在效果上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe方法，同时保持高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频目标检测提供了一种有效且隐蔽的通用对抗攻击策略，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

TL;DR: 这篇综述分析了2018-2025年间49项关于无监督深度生成模型在神经影像异常检测中的研究，包括自编码器、变分自编码器、生成对抗网络和去噪扩散模型，这些模型能够仅使用健康数据训练并识别与学习到的正常脑结构的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督方法需要大量体素级标注数据且仅限于特征明确的病理，而无监督深度生成模型可以仅使用健康数据训练，识别各种病理的异常，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的罕见或异质性疾病。

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种压缩多任务图像恢复模型的方法MIR-L，通过迭代剪枝策略发现高度稀疏的子网络，仅保留10%可训练参数的同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型虽然能同时处理多种图像退化问题，但参数量过大导致计算效率低下，需要压缩模型以提高效率。

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，通过多轮移除低幅值权重并将剩余权重重置为原始初始化，发现高性能的稀疏子网络。

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务上的实验表明，MIR-L仅保留10%参数就能保持高水平的图像恢复性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了多任务图像恢复模型的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著减少了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧活动对农业生产和生物多样性都有重要影响，但目前缺乏可扩展的放牧监测方法。需要利用遥感技术解决牧场使用合规性检查的资源限制问题

Method: 基于Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据，对每个多边形定义的牧场边界，使用4-10月的影像进行二元预测（放牧/未放牧）。训练CNN-LSTM集成模型处理多时序反射特征

Result: 在五个验证分割上平均F1得分为77%，对放牧牧场的召回率达到90%。在年度最多检查4%场地的情况下，优先检查模型预测为未放牧的场地，比随机检查多发现17.2倍的确认未放牧场地

Conclusion: 粗分辨率、免费可用的卫星数据能够可靠地指导检查资源分配，支持保护导向的土地使用合规性监管

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba在图像分类中表现出比ViTs更好的计算效率（线性vs二次复杂度）和比CNN更少的可训练参数，这为三维多孔介质渗透率预测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为骨干网络构建神经网络模型，与ViT和CNN模型在多个方面进行渗透率预测性能比较，并进行消融研究评估各组件对准确性的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViTs，为相关研究提供了可复现的源代码。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

Abstract: Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical
integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical
complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing
often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and
inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection
framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects
in real-time, ensuring high accuracy and industrial scalability. The model is
trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument
types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against
state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种噪声投影器方法，通过文本条件优化初始噪声来改善Stable Diffusion生成图像与文本提示的对齐度，无需修改SD模型本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中的训练-推理不匹配问题：训练时噪声位于提示特定的潜在空间子集，而推理时从提示无关的高斯先验采样噪声，导致生成图像与提示对齐不佳。

Method: 设计噪声投影器，在去噪前对初始噪声进行文本条件优化；通过采样噪声、从视觉语言模型获取反馈、蒸馏到奖励模型，最后通过准直接偏好优化优化噪声投影器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著提高不同提示下文本-图像对齐度，且推理成本低，无需多样本选择。

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知噪声投影方法有效改善了文本到图像生成的对齐质量，无需参考图像或手工先验，推理效率高。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA是一个用于医学图像领域协调和可解释表示学习的框架，通过分离域不变和域特定特征，在保持疾病相关信息的同时提供高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像（如MR扫描）存在跨成像站点的域偏移问题，这降低了机器学习在疾病分类等任务中的性能。现有方法虽然有效但缺乏可解释性，而可解释性在医学应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出PL-SE-ADA框架，包含两个编码器f_E和f_SE分别提取域不变特征z_u和域特定特征z_d，一个解码器f_D用于图像重建，以及一个域预测器g_D。通过对抗训练和图像重建（将z_u和z_d的重构相加）来确保协调性和信息保留。

Result: 与现有方法相比，PL-SE-ADA在图像重建、疾病分类和域识别方面达到同等或更好的性能，并能可视化域独立脑特征和域特定组件。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA成功解决了医学图像域协调问题，在保持高性能的同时提供了高可解释性，能够可视化域不变和域特定特征，满足医学应用的实际需求。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Conclusion: 通过深度预测任务增强VLA模型，能够有效提升其空间感知和推理能力，在精细操作任务中取得良好效果。

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 深度学习内部表示不透明，而经典视觉描述符（如边缘、颜色、强度分布）对人类直观可理解，探索现代学习能否从这些经典线索中受益。

Method: 提出VisualSplit框架，将图像显式分解为解耦的经典描述符，通过重建驱动的预训练方案学习每个视觉描述符的本质。

Result: 该方法在图像生成和编辑等高级视觉任务中实现了有效的属性控制，超越了传统的分类和分割任务。

Conclusion: 这种新的学习方法在视觉理解方面显示出有效性，通过显式分解视觉属性促进了可解释性和控制性。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法都是一步调整，对于复杂数据集（不同模态特征高度纠缠的情况）不够充分，需要多步修正能力来实现更精确和鲁棒的对齐。

Method: 1. 使用固定耦合策略确保训练过程中类别对应；2. 提出噪声增强策略缓解数据稀缺问题；3. 设计早停求解器提前终止变换过程，提高效率和准确性。

Result: FMA在各种基准测试和骨干网络上都能持续带来显著的性能提升，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: 相比一步PEFT方法，FMA具有多步修正能力，能够实现更精确和鲁棒的跨模态特征对齐。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的场景去上下文化方法SDeC，通过抑制文本到图像模型中固有的场景-身份相关性来解决身份偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设预先知道所有目标场景，这在现实中不切实际。研究发现身份偏移的关键原因是模型训练过程中自然形成的场景-身份相关性。

Method: 提出SDeC方法，通过量化SVD方向稳定性来自适应重加权特征值，抑制ID提示嵌入中的潜在场景-身份相关性，实现场景去上下文化。

Result: 实验证明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC是一种高效、无需训练且灵活的解决方案，特别适合现实世界应用，无需预先知道所有目标场景。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

Motivation: 传统3DGS训练存在三个关键低效问题：高斯密度分配不均、计算负载不平衡和内存访问碎片化，影响训练效率。

Method: 1) 算法层面：启发式负载敏感高斯密度控制，平衡点分布；2) 系统层面：相似性高斯采样合并，动态分配工作负载；3) 映射层面：基于重排序的内存访问映射策略，优化RGB存储。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上相比3DGS实现1.44倍训练加速，质量损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3DGS训练中的效率瓶颈，显著提升训练速度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位开辟了新的应用前景

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

Motivation: 当前视频生成在保持物体运动连贯性和交互方面存在困难，主要瓶颈包括：人类提供的运动提示在编码后有效token过少，以及单一优化头倾向于纹理而非时间一致性。

Method: 1. 实例线索：将稀疏的用户可编辑提示转换为密集的2.5D运动场；2. 密集RoPE：在token空间中保持线索显著性；3. 联合RGB+辅助图预测，分离结构和外观处理。

Result: 该方法减少了深度模糊性，稳定了优化过程，提高了时间连贯性。

Conclusion: STANCE通过简单的组件有效解决了视频生成中的运动一致性问题，无需复杂的逐帧轨迹规划。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

*Ning Ding,Keisuke Fujii,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shot2Tactic-Caption是一个羽毛球视频字幕生成框架，能够在射击和战术两个时间尺度上生成描述，包含双分支架构和战术单元检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 羽毛球战术理解需要解释个体动作以及战术随时间动态执行的方式，现有方法缺乏对战术层面时间动态的捕捉能力。

Method: 采用双分支设计，包括视觉编码器、时空Transformer编码器和基于Transformer的解码器；引入战术单元检测器识别有效战术单元、类型和状态；使用射击提示引导机制将预测的战术类型和状态作为提示注入解码器。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在生成射击和战术字幕方面有效；消融研究显示基于ResNet50的时空编码器优于其他变体，射击提示结构能产生更连贯准确的战术字幕。

Conclusion: 提出的Shot2Tactic-Caption框架能够有效生成多尺度羽毛球视频字幕，特别是通过射击提示引导机制成功捕捉被中断后恢复的战术执行过程。

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS是一种简单即插即用的视频采样方法，通过识别和剪枝时间上静态的补丁来减少视频中的令牌冗余，显著降低令牌数量同时保持语义保真度，实现更快推理和更长输入序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从静态图像理解扩展到视频推理时，处理密集帧序列的二次成本限制了其可扩展性。长视频经常超出现代语言模型的令牌预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: 引入高效视频采样(EVS)，通过识别和剪枝时间上静态的补丁（在连续帧间保持不变的空间区域）来减少视频令牌冗余。该方法保持位置身份，无需架构更改或重新训练。

Result: EVS在推理时应用，将大型语言模型的首次令牌时间(TTFT)减少高达4倍，精度损失最小。结合使用随机剪枝率的上训练阶段，EVS产生对不同程度压缩具有鲁棒性的模型，在激进剪枝下保持完整性能。

Conclusion: EVS持续改进效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器获得的单个连续潜在令牌来表示图像，通过微调语义令牌嵌入和生成解码器，实现高效的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，显著降低训练成本，同时保持生成质量。

Method: 基于预训练的SSL编码器，仅微调语义令牌嵌入，配合使用流匹配目标的生成解码器，添加余弦相似度损失来正则化适应后的令牌。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上以极有限的训练预算达到竞争性的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 微调的SSL表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，用于高效的生成建模。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出SteeringTTA框架，通过Feynman-Kac引导方法在测试时适应分布偏移，无需模型更新或源数据，在ImageNet-C上表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于扩散的测试时适应方法依赖梯度引导、限制探索和泛化能力的问题。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导方法，通过伪标签驱动的奖励机制，维护多个粒子轨迹，结合累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索和置信度。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上持续优于基线方法，无需任何模型更新或源数据。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA是一个有效的推理专用框架，能够提升分类任务在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本预训练策略，用于基于指令的视频编辑，通过上下文学习从未配对的视频片段中学习编辑能力，显著提升了指令对齐和视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的图像编辑发展迅速，但扩展到视频领域仍面临挑战，主要由于构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集的成本过高和复杂性。

Method: 采用基于上下文学习的低成本预训练策略，首先在约100万个真实视频片段上进行预训练学习基本编辑概念，然后在少于15万个精选编辑对上进行微调以扩展编辑任务并提高编辑质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面均优于现有的基于指令的视频编辑方法，编辑指令遵循度提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了通过低成本预训练策略可以有效赋予基础视频生成模型通用编辑能力，为基于指令的视频编辑提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: 将去相关反向传播（DBP）集成到MAE预训练中，通过减少输入相关性来加速收敛，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本和碳排放


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE预训练在低标签场景下表现优异，但计算成本过高，限制了在时间和资源受限的工业环境中的应用

Method: 在MAE预训练的编码器中有选择性地应用DBP优化方法，通过迭代减少各层输入相关性来加速收敛

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练和ADE20K微调中，DBP-MAE将达到基线性能的挂钟时间减少21.1%，碳排放降低21.4%，分割mIoU提高1.1个百分点

Conclusion: DBP能够在大规模ViT预训练中显著减少训练时间和能源消耗，同时提升下游任务性能，具有实际工业应用价值

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的重要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度和地理范围上有限，需要长期一致的监测来支持可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 构建EuroMineNet数据集，支持两个可持续性驱动任务：多时相采矿足迹测绘（使用新的Change-Aware Temporal IoU指标评估）和跨时相变化检测。对20个最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试。

Result: GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测对及时缓解至关重要的短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致和可解释的采矿监测，有助于可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性，以及应用GeoAI实现社会和环境效益的更广泛目标。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

TL;DR: 提出了首个弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络WeCKD，通过构建渐进式蒸馏链来重新定义知识传递，解决了传统知识蒸馏中知识退化、监督效率低和数据依赖性强的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏依赖静态师生框架，存在知识退化、监督效率低、依赖强教师模型或大数据集的问题，限制了在现实世界有限数据场景下的有效性。

Method: 构建渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型不仅从前驱学习知识，还会在传递前进行知识精炼，形成结构化知识传递，每个模型仅使用部分数据集进行训练。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上的评估显示，其性能不仅匹配而且在很多情况下超越了现有监督方法，在其他两个数据集上验证了跨医学成像模态的泛化能力，相比单骨干网络在有限数据上训练获得了最高+23%的累积准确率提升。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过链式知识蒸馏结构有效减少了数据依赖，缓解了一步式知识蒸馏的局限性，在有限监督下实现了高效学习，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Result: 在Qwen2VL-7B和GPT4o基准上，视频时序定位和推理问答任务性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了组合性和可解释的推理过程，为视频理解系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射压缩技术虽然显著减少了存储开销，但由于缺乏学习先验，限制了率失真权衡的进一步提升。需要解决压缩引起的质量退化问题。

Method: 基于初始压缩的高斯模型，构建恢复网络在图像空间建模压缩伪影，引入粗渲染残差作为辅助信息，通过恢复图像的监督来优化压缩高斯表示。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容现有的高斯压缩方法，能够产生高度紧凑的表示并增强渲染性能，为3DGS压缩提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open

Method: CFSAM包含三个组件：卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元（捕获跨层交互）、特征融合机制（恢复和增强原始表征）

Result: 在SSD300框架中集成CFSAM，PASCAL VOC上mAP达78.6%（vs 75.5%基线），COCO上达52.1%（vs 43.1%基线），优于现有注意力模块，且加速训练收敛

Conclusion: 显式跨层注意力建模对推进多尺度目标检测具有重要意义

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

Motivation: 现有分层图像分类方法通常假设完整的细粒度标注，但现实世界中的标注粒度因图像质量、标注者专业知识和任务需求而异，存在混合粒度的监督信号。

Method: 使用CLIP模拟语义模糊性来生成混合粒度的标注，提出free-grain学习方法，通过视觉语言模型生成伪属性和半监督学习来增强语义和视觉指导。

Result: 提出的方法在混合监督下显著提升了分层图像分类的性能。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准测试和free-grain学习方法推进了在现实世界约束下的分层分类研究。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

TL;DR: DEXTER是一个无需数据的框架，使用扩散模型和大型语言模型为视觉分类器生成全局文本解释，通过优化文本提示合成激活目标分类器的类条件图像，然后生成描述类特定决策模式和偏见的自然语言报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解和解释机器学习模型的行为对于构建透明可信的AI系统至关重要，需要在不依赖训练数据或真实标签的情况下生成自然语言解释。

Method: 通过优化文本提示合成类条件图像来强烈激活目标分类器，然后使用这些合成样本生成详细的自然语言报告来描述类特定决策模式和偏见。

Result: 在ImageNet、Waterbirds、CelebA和FairFaces上的实验表明，DEXTER在全局模型解释和类级偏见报告方面优于现有方法，定量和定性评估（包括用户研究）显示其产生准确、可解释的输出。

Conclusion: DEXTER展示了在三个任务（激活最大化、切片发现和去偏、偏见解释）中的灵活性，能够揭示视觉分类器的内部机制，为构建透明AI系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LightQANet框架，通过量化自适应特征学习解决低光图像增强问题，包含光照量化模块和光照感知提示模块，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低光条件下难以提取可靠特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影问题

Method: 设计光照量化模块(LQM)显式提取和量化光照相关因素，以及光照感知提示模块(LAPM)将光照先验编码为可学习提示来动态指导特征学习

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，在各种挑战性光照场景下提供优越的定性和定量结果

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化自适应特征学习能够实现跨不同光照条件的一致且鲁棒的图像质量

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL是一个用于开放词汇目标检测的新框架，通过引入视觉思维链推理来改进伪标签生成，在拥挤和遮挡场景中显著提升新类别的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放词汇目标检测方法过度依赖直接的图像-文本匹配，缺乏对语义复杂场景的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: CoT-PL将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本类别识别和背景定位，并引入对比背景学习来促进目标与背景的特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类别伪标签质量分别比之前最佳方法提升了103.4%和168.4%；在开放词汇COCO上AP50提升+7.7，在LVIS上新类别mask AP提升+2.9，达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 视觉思维链推理和对比背景学习的集成框架能够显著提升开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

TL;DR: 开发了PRISM模型，一种可解释的AI模型，通过整合连续变异谱来表征结直肠癌的形态多样性，在5年总生存期预测上表现优异，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算病理学基础模型往往忽略器官特异性关键形态模式，而这些模式代表不同的生物过程，能从根本上影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后。

Method: PRISM模型整合了每个不同形态内的连续变异谱，基于424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像进行训练，反映恶性转化是通过渐进进化过程而非突然表型转变的原理。

Result: PRISM在5年总生存期预测上表现优异（AUC=0.70±0.04；准确率=68.37%±4.75%；HR=3.34），比现有CRC特异性方法高15%，比AI基础模型高约23%准确率。模型具有性别无关的鲁棒性和跨临床病理亚组的稳定性能。

Conclusion: PRISM模型成功捕捉了结直肠癌的形态多样性，提供了优异的预后预测性能，证明了整合连续变异谱在表征肿瘤进化过程中的价值。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super是一种利用医学报告训练AI进行肿瘤分割的新方法，大幅减少了对人工绘制肿瘤掩模的需求，在多种肿瘤类型上实现了与基于掩模训练相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期肿瘤检测能挽救生命，但训练AI模型需要大量人工绘制的肿瘤掩模，成本高昂且耗时。而临床实践中几乎每个CT扫描都配有描述肿瘤特征的医学报告，这些丰富信息在AI训练中未被充分利用。

Method: 引入R-Super方法，训练AI根据医学报告中的描述来分割肿瘤，利用大量现成的医学报告进行规模化AI训练。

Result: 在101,654份报告上训练的AI模型性能与基于723个掩模训练的模型相当。结合报告和掩模训练使敏感性提高+13%，特异性提高+8%，在7种肿瘤类型中有5种检测性能超过放射科医生。

Conclusion: 这项研究挑战了大规模人工肿瘤掩模创建不可或缺的传统观念，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测建立了可扩展且易于实现的路径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

TL;DR: PRTraj是一个新的轨迹表示学习框架，通过统一环境感知和路线选择建模来改进轨迹嵌入表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了外部环境和内部路线选择行为对轨迹形成的影响。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块捕获多粒度环境语义，以及路线选择编码器建模路段转换决策序列，最终聚合形成全局轨迹嵌入。

Result: 在3个真实数据集和5个下游任务上的实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，且在少样本场景下仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过结合环境感知和路线选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的性能和数据效率。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决大容量生成模型无法在智能手机等内存和计算资源有限的设备上部署的问题，同时保持模型质量。

Method: 采用渐进式分数位量化方法，从32位逐步降低到4位精度，在优化过程中利用分数位来维持生成质量。

Result: 在多种扩散模型(SD3.5-Medium、Sana、Pixart、FLUX.1-schnell)上实现质量提升，比标准QAT降低4-7%的FiD分数，成功在三星S25U手机上部署Sana模型。

Conclusion: SHORT方法有效解决了生成模型在资源受限设备上的部署问题，在保持质量的同时实现了高效计算。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模、体素级标注的肿瘤数据集，AI在肿瘤分割方面的性能受到限制。作者发现合成数据可以显著减少对真实数据的需求，因此创建了大规模数据集来推动AI发展。

Method: 创建了AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描，15,130个肿瘤实例，涵盖六个器官（胰腺、肝脏、肾脏、结肠、食道和子宫），由23名放射科专家进行体素级手动标注。

Result: 该数据集在分布内测试中实现了+7%的DSC增益，在分布外测试中实现了+16%的DSC增益，显著优于现有公共数据集。

Conclusion: AbdomenAtlas 2.0为训练AI分割六个器官中的肿瘤提供了坚实基础，证明了大规模标注数据集对提升AI性能的重要性。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Conclusion: ImagerySearch方法在挑战性想象力设置中能够生成更连贯和视觉上合理的视频，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

Conclusion: 该框架使医生能将机器学习诊断与临床相关标准联系起来，增进对皮肤癌进展的理解，为未来研究开辟更多可能性。

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型在人脸识别任务中的潜力，并与现有专用人脸识别模型进行性能比较

Method: 在LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB和RFW等多个标准人脸识别数据集上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统性基准测试

Result: MLLMs能够捕捉丰富的语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中表现不如专用模型

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于MLLM的人脸识别提供了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

TL;DR: 提出了Free-Form HOI Generation方法，通过细粒度意图控制生成多样化、物理合理的手-物交互，超越传统抓取模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物交互生成研究局限于固定抓取模式，控制依赖于物理先验或通用意图指令，无法捕捉日常交互的多样性。

Method: 构建WildO2数据集，提出TOUCH三阶段框架，基于多级扩散模型实现细粒度语义控制，利用显式接触建模和物理约束优化。

Result: 能够生成可控、多样化且物理合理的手-物交互，涵盖推、戳、旋转等自由形式交互。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了手-物交互从抓取到自由形式交互的范围，为日常活动中的多样化交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法区分自车威胁和不涉及自车的随机事故，导致实际部署中产生过多误报。

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络端到端训练，在Nexar真实世界行车记录仪碰撞数据集上训练，提供BADAS-Open（1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（40k专有视频）两个版本。

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上取得最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并提供更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS在ego-centric碰撞预测方面表现优异，作者发布了模型权重、代码和所有评估数据集的重新标注，以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

Motivation: 虽然视觉自回归模型在生成保真度和推理效率方面取得了显著进展，但在VAR范式下实现精确灵活的控制机制仍未被充分探索，需要弥合这一关键差距。

Method: 提出ScaleWeaver框架，核心是改进的MMDiT块和参考注意力模块，该模块丢弃了图像→条件的不必要注意力，降低计算成本并稳定控制注入，同时强调参数重用，利用VAR主干能力处理控制信息，配备零初始化线性投影确保控制信号有效整合而不破坏基础模型生成能力。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver是视觉自回归范式中实用有效的可控文本到图像生成解决方案，代码和模型将发布。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或不超过5个选项的多选题，无法应对细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的挑战，且在多选项设置下扩展LLM选择提取到检索问题存在计算成本高的问题

Method: nlg2choice两阶段方法：首先向MLLM提出开放式问题，然后使用纯文本约束解码预测最可能的选择；在检索设置中，采用提前停止方法计算约束响应选择概率，显著提高吞吐量

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的结果显示，在分类和检索评估方面均有改进，且性能在各种自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类中的评估挑战，为处理大规模选项的视觉任务提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法难以检测涉及对象交互的复杂异常，且缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用MLLM分析不同时刻对象对的视觉输入，生成活动和交互的文本描述，在测试时与正常训练视频的文本描述进行比较

Result: 在基准数据集上有效检测基于交互的复杂异常，并在无交互异常的数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能有效检测复杂交互异常，还提供内在可解释性，可与传统VAD方法结合提升可解释性

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Conclusion: 通过合成字幕数据预训练，MaskCaptioner能够有效解决密集视频对象字幕任务，提供端到端的检测、分割、跟踪和字幕生成能力。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt是一个视频生成框架，通过双时空条件和3D场景记忆实现精确相机控制和场景一致性，在长视频生成中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于单张图像或短视频片段进行条件生成，难以在生成长视频时保持场景一致性和精确相机控制。

Method: 采用双时空条件机制：时间相邻帧用于运动连续性，空间相邻内容用于场景一致性。引入3D场景记忆存储静态几何信息，通过动态SLAM和动态掩码策略分离静态场景和动态元素。

Result: 在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法，能够保持长距离空间连贯性而不牺牲计算效率或运动真实性。

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt通过结合3D场景记忆和双时空条件，成功解决了长视频生成中的场景一致性和相机控制问题，为视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Conclusion: RealDPO通过真实世界数据驱动的偏好学习有效解决了复杂运动合成的挑战，为视频生成模型提供了更准确的运动合成能力。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频恢复4D（动态几何和相机位姿）的框架，通过引入短时光流和长时点跟踪对应关系，扩展了现有3D重建方法到动态场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点图式3D重建方法（如DUSt3R）在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景会导致不准确结果，因为运动物体违反了多视角几何约束。

Method: C4D预测点图的同时捕获两种对应关系：短时光流和长时点跟踪。训练动态感知点跟踪器提供移动性信息，估计运动掩码分离移动元素与静态背景，并引入动态场景优化目标来恢复每帧3D几何和相机参数。

Result: 实验表明该框架实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机位姿估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: C4D通过时间对应关系成功将3D重建扩展到4D，有效解决了动态场景中的重建挑战。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Conclusion: 提出的token-wise attention集成方法有效解决了扩散模型在降水临近预报中的可扩展性问题，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法假设场景点云是重建且最新的，这在现实动态场景中需要频繁重新扫描，成本高昂且阻碍实际部署。

Method: 提出Mem-ChangingGrounder方法：通过跨模态检索识别查询对象类型，利用相关记忆指导行动，在场景中高效探索目标，进行多视角扫描并将融合证据投影得到精确边界框。

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准上评估，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高的定位精度，同时显著降低了探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法推动了面向实际应用的、以记忆为中心的3D视觉定位研究发展。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了WithAnyone模型，通过构建MultiID-2M数据集和引入对比身份损失，解决了文本到图像生成中的copy-paste问题，在保持身份一致性的同时实现多样化生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份一致生成模型因缺乏大规模配对数据而依赖重建训练，导致copy-paste问题——直接复制参考人脸而非保持身份在姿态、表情、光照等自然变化中的一致性，这削弱了可控性和生成表达能力。

Method: 构建MultiID-2M大规模配对数据集；提出量化copy-paste伪影和身份保真度-变化权衡的基准；引入基于对比身份损失的新训练范式；开发WithAnyone扩散模型。

Result: WithAnyone显著减少了copy-paste伪影，提高了姿态和表情的可控性，保持了强感知质量。用户研究验证了该方法在实现高身份保真度的同时支持富有表现力的可控生成。

Conclusion: 通过数据集构建、基准制定和新训练范式的综合贡献，WithAnyone模型有效缓解了copy-paste问题，在身份一致生成中实现了保真度与多样性的平衡。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Terra是一个原生3D世界模型，使用内在3D潜在空间表示和生成可探索环境，通过点到高斯变分自编码器和稀疏点流匹配网络实现高3D一致性的世界建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示，忽略了物理世界固有的3D特性，这会损害3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点到高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，然后解码为3D高斯基元；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示，同时对点潜在的位置和特征进行去噪。

Result: 在ScanNet v2室内场景数据集上，Terra在重建和生成方面均达到最先进性能，具有高3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过原生3D表示和架构实现了精确的多视角一致性，支持单次生成过程从任意视角灵活渲染，并通过点潜在空间中的渐进生成实现了可探索的世界建模。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

TL;DR: 提出无需配对数据的图像编辑训练新范式，通过视觉语言模型反馈直接优化扩散模型，在无监督情况下达到与有监督方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖大量输入-目标配对数据进行监督微调，但自然配对的训练数据难以大规模获取，而使用合成训练对会传播预训练模型的缺陷。

Method: 通过展开扩散模型训练过程，利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未变内容，提供端到端优化的直接梯度，同时结合分布匹配损失确保视觉保真度。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据的情况下，该方法在少步设置下与使用大量监督配对数据训练的图像编辑扩散模型表现相当，且优于基于强化学习的方法如Flow-GRPO。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了无需配对数据的图像编辑训练可行性，为克服数据瓶颈提供了新方向，同时保持了编辑质量和视觉保真度。

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

TL;DR: 本文提出了NEO系列原生视觉语言模型，通过设计三个核心原则来解决原生VLM与模块化VLM的区别问题，并实现了与顶级模块化模型相媲美的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原生视觉语言模型面临的两个核心挑战：明确其与模块化模型的基本约束差异，以及如何使原生VLM研究更加普及和民主化。

Method: 提出三个核心原则构建原生VLM：在共享语义空间中有效对齐像素和词表示；无缝整合视觉和语言模块优势；内在地体现支持统一视觉语言编码、对齐和推理的跨模态特性。基于这些原则开发了NEO模型家族。

Result: NEO模型仅使用3.9亿图像-文本样本，就能从零开始高效发展视觉感知能力，在多样化现实场景中与顶级模块化模型竞争。

Conclusion: NEO为可扩展和强大的原生视觉语言模型奠定了基础，提供了丰富的可复用组件，促进了成本效益高且可扩展的生态系统发展。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

TL;DR: 提出一种推理时扩散采样方法，通过隐式3D正则化实现多视角一致的图像编辑，避免显式3D表示的优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D图像编辑模型在多视角图像编辑中无法保持视角间一致性，而基于显式3D表示的方法存在优化过程冗长和稀疏视角下不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用耦合扩散采样技术，同时从多视角图像分布和2D编辑图像分布中采样两个轨迹，通过耦合项强制生成图像的多视角一致性。

Result: 在三个不同的多视角图像编辑任务上验证了该框架的有效性和通用性，展示了其在不同模型架构中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法作为多视角一致编辑的通用解决方案具有潜力，无需显式3D表示优化即可实现高质量的多视角编辑。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

TL;DR: 提出了SHaRe-SSM（尖峰谐波共振激发状态空间模型），一种用于超长序列建模的第二阶尖峰状态空间模型，相比Transformer和第一阶SSM性能更好，同时避免了乘法运算，能耗显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合尖峰神经网络（SNN）的能效优势和状态空间模型（SSM）在长序列建模中的能力，开发一种适合资源受限应用的乘法自由、稀疏事件驱动的深度学习方法。

Method: 设计第二阶尖峰SSM，利用并行扫描实现动态系统的稳定高效实现，首次提出基于核的尖峰回归器，使用共振激发神经元处理超长序列。

Result: 在18k序列上比第二阶ANN-based SSM能耗降低73倍，在50k序列上仍保持优异性能，同时进行了异质性、耗散和守恒性的系统性分析。

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM在超长序列建模中表现出优越性能和显著能效，为资源受限应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为低功耗在线异常检测提供了一种有效解决方案，特别适用于需要严格控制误报率的应用场景，通过智能传感器调度实现了检测效率与能耗的平衡。

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

Conclusion: 梯度上升是一种有效的机器遗忘方法，能够在移除特定数据的同时保持模型性能，为隐私保护提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

Conclusion: 该工作为鲁棒渐进域适应提供了理论洞见和实用框架，在动态现实场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

Motivation: 假设神经网络在深度特征的高频分量中编码任务相关语义信息，而在低频分量中存储领域特定偏差，通过分离这些分量来提升模型泛化性。

Method: 从原始特征中减去低通滤波输出，隔离可泛化表示同时保持架构完整性，实现特征稀疏化和高频分量隔离。

Conclusion: 该方法有效验证了核心假设，通过特征稀疏化和高频分量隔离显著提升模型泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LFS-GAN在每次训练迭代中引入大量新权重，长期来看参数负担显著。需要一种既能处理少样本学习又能进行持续学习的高效方法。

Method: 使用低秩张量适配模型到目标任务，提出LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA)技术优化卷积层的适配器大小，并进行超参数选择的实证研究。

Result: 在多个基准CL和FS任务上达到SOTA性能，同时显著减少所需资源数量。

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN是一个高效框架，能够在保持最先进性能的同时大幅降低参数需求，解决了GAN中持续少样本学习的关键挑战。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

*Zixian Yang,Sushil Mahavir Varma,Lei Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究双边市场中的定价和匹配算法，提出了一种基于在线学习的新颖定价策略，在平台利润最大化和队列长度控制之间实现了近乎最优的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在双边市场中，价格敏感的客户和服务器动态到达，平台需要设计定价和匹配算法来最大化利润，同时控制队列长度。由于实际中需求和供给曲线可能未知，需要开发在线学习策略。

Method: 提出了一种结合动态优化和概率组件的在线学习定价策略，动态组件优化低遗憾和小队列长度之间的权衡，概率组件解决快速学习所需样本与队列控制之间的冲突。

Result: 证明了在γ∈(0,1/6]范围内，实现了Õ(T^{1-γ})遗憾、Õ(T^{γ/2})平均队列长度和Õ(T^{γ})最大队列长度的性能权衡，显著优于现有结果，且该权衡在允许的γ范围内是最优的。

Conclusion: 所提出的策略在未知需求和供给曲线的情况下，实现了近乎最优的遗憾-队列长度权衡，为双边市场平台提供了有效的在线学习解决方案。

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-frames是一种基于场景驱动的新型关键帧选择方法，通过预测语义连贯的查询相关片段来保持时间连续性，支持任意数量的关键帧选择以适应不同用户预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中受到上下文窗口和计算成本的限制，均匀帧采样会导致大量信息丢失，而现有的关键帧选择方法（如文本帧检索或基于强化学习的帧优化）通常产生稀疏且时间不连续的帧，忽略了场景连续性，缺乏多尺度帧选择的灵活性。

Method: 提出K-frames方法，首先构建PeakClips数据集（包含20万个基于查询的视频高光片段），然后采用三阶段渐进式课程学习：两个监督微调阶段用于时间定位和关键片段感知，接着是强化学习阶段，直接优化场景驱动预测策略以适应下游任务，无需额外标注。

Result: 在主要的长视频理解基准测试上进行广泛实验，证明K-frames在多种尺度下提供了有效、可解释且即插即用的关键帧选择解决方案。

Conclusion: K-frames通过场景驱动的关键帧选择方法，解决了长视频理解中的信息丢失和场景连续性问题，为多尺度关键帧选择提供了灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视图半监督标签分布学习方法MVSS-LDL，通过利用每个视图的局部最近邻结构并强调多视图间局部结构的互补性，解决了多视图半监督标签分布学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标签分布学习方法主要针对单视图和全监督场景，而多视图半监督标签分布学习问题尚未被考虑。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 首先计算每个视图的k最近邻，然后通过整合其他视图的最近邻信息来补充每个视图的最近邻集合，最后基于补充后的最近邻集合构建基于图学习的多视图半监督标签分布学习模型。

Result: 数值研究表明，MVSS-LDL在分类性能上明显优于现有的单视图标签分布学习方法。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试解决多视图标签分布学习问题，通过考虑局部最近邻结构的互补性，不同视图可以相互提供局部结构信息来互补。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

TL;DR: 提出Weight Weaving方法，通过用户定义的池化函数在λ值搜索空间中池化模型权重，无需评估数据即可改进模型合并性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法严重依赖缩放超参数λ，但缺乏无需数据的原则性设置方法，实践中研究者往往使用评估数据调优λ，这在实际中不可行

Method: Weight Weaving技术，使用用户定义的池化函数（如平均、随机选择或现有模型合并方法）在λ值搜索空间中池化模型权重

Result: 在三个ViT变体和三种实验设置（视觉多任务学习、持续学习和领域泛化）中验证，平均准确率提升高达15.9个百分点

Conclusion: Weight Weaving具有高模块性，对搜索空间约束最小，与现有模型合并方法正交，无需评估数据要求

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的ICD编码自动分配方法，将问题重新定义为分类和排序任务，而不是传统的纯分类任务，从而能够考虑编码的顺序重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的ICD编码顺序对医疗诊断和报销至关重要，但现有方法将其视为纯分类任务，忽略了编码顺序的重要性。

Method: 从检索系统角度重新定义该任务，将其构建为分类和排序任务，以同时考虑编码分配和排序。

Result: 在主要诊断编码排序准确率方面达到47%，远超现有最佳方法的20%；在分类指标上，微平均和宏平均F1分数分别达到0.6065和0.2904，优于之前的0.597和0.2660。

Conclusion: 提出的分类-排序框架在识别高优先级编码方面具有显著优势，能够更好地处理ICD编码的顺序重要性。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的数据保真度损失函数——分布一致性损失，用于解决逆问题中传统点对点匹配方法容易过拟合噪声的问题，通过分布层面的校准来提升信号恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据保真度损失函数如均方误差或负对数似然追求与噪声测量的点对点一致性，容易导致对噪声的过拟合。作者希望开发一种更稳健的方法，从统计分布层面评估测量数据的一致性。

Method: 引入分布一致性损失，通过基于模型的概率评分来评估观测测量是否与当前估计所隐含的噪声分布统计一致，替代传统的点对点匹配方法。该方法与现代正则化器兼容，优化方式与传统损失相同。

Result: 在图像去噪中，使用DC损失替代MSE损失无需早停即可获得更高的PSNR；在医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了高度迭代重建中的伪影，并增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失为逆问题提供了一种统计基础扎实、性能提升的替代方案，可避免对测量噪声的过拟合，即使不使用先验信息也能获得良好效果。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

TL;DR: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) 是一种轻量级方法，可将全精度大语言模型微调为1.58位精度（三元权重{-1, 0, 1}），在特定下游任务上实现接近全精度模型的性能，同时显著降低内存占用和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全精度大语言模型在特定任务上部署时的高计算成本和内存需求问题，通过极低位量化实现高效推理。

Method: 结合三种关键技术：SubLN模块（来自BitNet）、多头注意力蒸馏（基于MiniLM）和持续预训练作为预热步骤，缓解全精度与1.58位模型在特定任务上的性能差距。

Result: BitDistill在不同模型规模上实现了与全精度模型相当的性能，同时实现高达10倍内存节省和2.65倍CPU推理加速。

Conclusion: BitDistill提供了一种有效的轻量级解决方案，可在保持任务性能的同时显著降低大语言模型的部署成本，特别适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏激活的专家混合模型参数量大导致内存开销高，现有研究倾向于专家合并，但本文发现这对生成任务不利。

Method: 提出Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP)方法，综合考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数进行剪枝。

Result: 在20B到1T参数的SMoE模型上，REAP在生成基准测试中始终优于合并和其他剪枝方法，在50%压缩率下表现尤其突出，在代码生成和工具调用任务上实现近乎无损压缩。

Conclusion: 专家剪枝是生成任务中更优的压缩策略，REAP方法能有效避免合并带来的功能子空间坍塌问题。

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

Motivation: Clifford-Steerable CNNs的核基不完整，限制了模型的表达能力，需要改进以提升在物理系统建模中的性能。

Method: 提出条件Clifford可操纵核，通过输入特征场的等变表示来增强核，推导等变约束条件并采用隐式参数化高效求解。

Result: 在多个PDE预测任务（流体动力学和相对论电动力学）上，该方法持续优于基线方法，证明了改进的表达能力。

Conclusion: 条件Clifford可操纵核有效解决了CSCNNs核基不完整的问题，显著提升了模型在物理系统建模中的性能。

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-GCN网络架构，通过解耦节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应，显著提升异构多跳无线网络中p-persistent CSMA协议饱和吞吐量的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统简化模型在稀疏拓扑中会低估吞吐量48-62%，而精确马尔可夫链分析计算复杂度呈指数增长，无法应用于大型网络。现有GNN方法因对称归一化混淆了直接干扰与高阶级联效应，预测误差高达63.94%。

Method: 设计解耦图卷积网络(D-GCN)，用可学习注意力机制替代均值聚合，显式分离节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应的处理，捕捉复杂的多跳干扰模式。

Result: D-GCN达到3.3%的归一化平均绝对误差，优于现有基线方法，在精确分析方法计算不可行时仍保持可处理性，基于梯度的网络优化能达到理论最优值的1%以内。

Conclusion: D-GCN通过解耦设计有效解决了异构多跳无线网络中吞吐量预测的挑战，为大规模网络性能分析和优化提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在几何感知优化算法基础上添加噪声自适应分层学习率的方法，通过估计梯度方差来动态调整不同层的学习率，显著加速深度神经网络训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何感知优化算法（如Muon）虽然通过为不同层选择适当范数来利用DNN的几何结构，但在同一范数组内的层中仍使用固定学习率。然而，不同层的局部曲率存在异质性且动态变化，固定学习率可能效率低下。

Method: 在几何感知优化算法基础上引入噪声自适应分层学习率方案，实时估计由所选LMO诱导的对偶范数中的梯度方差，并据此为每个组内的层分配时变的噪声自适应分层学习率。

Result: 理论分析表明该算法实现了锐利的收敛率。在LLaMA和GPT等transformer架构上的实证结果显示，该方法比最先进的优化器收敛更快。

Conclusion: 提出的噪声自适应分层学习率方案能够有效加速DNN训练，特别是在transformer架构上表现出优于现有优化器的收敛性能。

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers存在二次复杂度和长序列依赖处理困难的问题，而现有状态空间模型（如Mamba的S6模块）的选择性机制仅依赖当前输入，缺乏对序列历史的上下文感知能力。

Method: COFFEE模型引入状态反馈机制，从内部状态计算选择性，将内部状态作为序列历史的紧凑表示，并采用高效的模型参数化方法消除S6中的冗余。

Result: 在induction head任务上，COFFEE以比S6少两个数量级的参数和训练序列实现接近完美的准确率；在MNIST上，仅用3585个参数就达到97%准确率，大幅超越S6。

Conclusion: 状态反馈是构建可扩展高效序列模型的关键机制，COFFEE展示了其在提升长序列依赖建模能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的因果表示学习基准，使用高保真模拟视觉数据，包含约20万张图像和300万视频帧，涵盖4个领域的24个子场景，旨在弥合严格评估与现实应用之间的差距。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果表示学习的评估存在困境：要么依赖过于简化的合成数据集，要么基于真实世界任务的下游性能，难以兼顾真实性和评估精度。

Method: 创建包含静态图像生成、动态物理模拟、机器人操作和交通情况分析四个领域的高保真模拟视觉数据集，提供对底层因果生成过程的访问，并允许用户修改因果结构以符合CRL假设。

Conclusion: 该基准通过结合视觉真实性和可访问的因果生成过程，为因果表示学习提供了更全面的测试平台，有助于将CRL方法应用于现实问题。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedHFT是一个高效的个性化联邦微调框架，通过混合掩码适配器处理资源异构性，并使用双层优化方法处理非IID数据分布，在数据隐私保护下实现高性能的预训练语言模型协作微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决个性化自然语言理解应用中面临的两个主要挑战：(1) 由于数据保密性或隐私要求导致的有限和/或异构数据；(2) 参与客户端（如边缘设备）计算资源的差异性。

Method: 引入混合掩码适配器处理资源异构性，采用基于掩码个性化和客户端聚类的双层优化方法处理非IID数据分布，在分布式环境中保持专有数据本地化。

Result: 在数据和资源异构条件下，相比代表性异构联邦学习方法，在各种自然语言理解任务上展现出显著的性能和效率提升。

Conclusion: FedHFT框架有效解决了联邦学习中数据异构性和资源异构性的双重挑战，为个性化NLU应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

### [123] [On the expressivity of sparse maxout networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14068)
*Moritz Grillo,Tobias Hofmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，建立了网络与虚拟多面体之间的对偶关系，推导了深度层次结构，并证明了在深度不足时宽度无法弥补固定入度的稀疏性约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，这类网络捕捉了卷积神经网络和图神经网络的关键特征，旨在理解其计算能力和结构约束之间的关系。

Method: 建立了稀疏maxout网络与虚拟多面体类之间的对偶关系，利用多面体几何分析网络表达能力，推导了相关多面体维度的紧致界，并构建了深度层次结构。

Result: 证明了充分深的稀疏maxout网络具有通用性，但在深度不足时，仅靠增加宽度无法补偿固定入度的稀疏性约束。

Conclusion: 稀疏maxout网络的表达能力与深度密切相关，深度是克服稀疏性约束的关键因素，而宽度在深度不足时无法替代深度的作用。

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Neural Effect Search的新方法，直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，无需预先设定假设，通过预训练基础模型和稀疏自编码器将非结构化数据转化为有意义表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机对照试验依赖于手工制定的假设和昂贵的分析，这限制了因果效应估计的规模，可能固守流行但不完整的假设。

Method: 使用预训练基础模型将试验中的非结构化数据转化为表示，通过稀疏自编码器进行解释，并引入Neural Effect Search递归程序，通过渐进分层解决多重检验和效应纠缠问题。

Result: 在半合成实验中验证了算法的鲁棒性，并在实验生态学背景下首次成功实现了真实世界科学试验中的无监督因果效应识别。

Conclusion: 该方法能够直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，突破了传统随机对照试验的局限性，为大规模因果发现提供了新途径。

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

Motivation: 解决机器学习中系统性组合泛化超越训练分布的核心挑战，特别是现代语言模型在推理能力方面的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出了四种架构机制：输入自适应循环、算法监督、通过离散瓶颈的锚定潜在表示、显式纠错机制，并在GSM8K风格的模块化算术计算图任务上进行测试。

Result: 这些机制共同形成了一种在Transformer网络中实现原生可扩展潜在空间推理的架构方法，具有强大的算法泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性分析揭示了这些机制如何产生稳健的OOD泛化能力，为Transformer网络提供了增强推理和泛化能力的新途径。

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

Motivation: 现有转移熵估计方法存在维度灾难、需要限制性分布假设或需要指数级大数据集才能可靠收敛的问题。

Method: TENDE方法利用基于分数的扩散模型学习相关条件分布的分值函数，通过条件互信息来估计转移熵，对底层数据生成过程做最小假设。

Result: 在合成基准测试和真实数据上，TENDE相比现有神经估计器和其他最先进方法展现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TENDE提供了一种灵活、可扩展的转移熵估计方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Conclusion: 将合并重新定义为生成重构能力强的模型空间而非单一合并模型，能够有效解决低秩模型合并的性能退化问题。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich

*Mahmood Hegazy,Aaron Rodrigues,Azzam Naeem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAFA是一个生产部署的多智能体标注框架，通过可配置的多智能体协作解决金融服务中的大规模标注积压问题，在摩根大通成功消除100万条话语积压，节省5000多小时人工标注时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融服务领域存在数百万条客户话语需要准确分类的标注积压问题，传统方法效率低下，需要更智能的自动化解决方案。

Method: 结合专业智能体、结构化推理和基于评判的共识机制，支持通过配置而非代码修改来定义自定义标注类型，实现动态任务适应。

Result: 在摩根大通部署后消除100万条话语积压，平均与人工标注者达成86%一致率，标注置信度分类为85%高、10%中、5%低，在多个数据集上相比传统方法提升13.8% Top-1准确率、15.1% Top-5准确率和16.9% F1分数。

Conclusion: MAFA弥合了理论多智能体系统与实际企业部署之间的差距，为面临类似标注挑战的组织提供了蓝图。

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

TL;DR: ConDA框架通过对比学习在扩散嵌入中对齐潜在几何与系统动态，使潜在空间中的遍历方向反映底层动态因素，从而支持非线性轨迹遍历和可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型擅长生成，但其潜在空间未明确组织以实现可解释控制。受对比学习能恢复更解缠和结构化表示的启发，需要组织扩散潜在空间以反映系统动态。

Method: 在扩散嵌入中应用对比学习，对齐潜在几何与系统动态，组织潜在空间使遍历方向反映底层动态因素，支持非线性轨迹遍历。

Result: 在流体动力学、神经钙成像、治疗性神经刺激和面部表情等基准测试中，ConDA相比线性遍历和基于条件的基线方法，产生了具有更好可控性的可解释潜在表示。

Conclusion: 扩散潜在编码了动态相关结构，但利用这种结构需要潜在组织并沿着潜在流形进行遍历。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

TL;DR: 对分子核方法进行首次全面谱分析，发现更丰富的谱特征并不总能提高预测精度，甚至在某些情况下与性能呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度模型在分子性质预测中达到最先进精度，但核方法在低数据场景下仍因其鲁棒性和理论透明度被广泛使用。目前缺乏对分子核谱的系统性分析。

Method: 在QM9数据集上对分子指纹、预训练transformer、全局和局部3D表示等七种分子性质进行核岭回归谱分析，使用四种谱度量指标，并实施截断核来研究谱与预测性能的关系。

Result: 更丰富的谱特征并不一致提高准确性；对于transformer和局部3D表示，谱丰富度与性能呈负相关；保留前2%特征值即可恢复几乎所有性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了"更丰富谱导致更好泛化"的常见启发式，揭示了表示、核特征与预测性能之间的微妙关系，为数据受限的科学和实际任务中的核与自监督学习方法评估提供了启示。

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文严谨分析了平坦性与对抗鲁棒性的关系，发现平坦最小值只能提供局部而非全局鲁棒性，并揭示了对抗样本常位于模型自信但错误的平坦区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络经验上成功，但仍易受微小对抗扰动影响。长期假设认为平坦最小值（损失景观中低曲率区域）能提供更强鲁棒性，但这一联系缺乏严谨形式化分析。

Method: 首先推导了倒数第二层相对平坦度的闭式表达式，利用此约束输入空间中损失变化，从而形式化分析整个网络的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 平坦性仅能保证局部鲁棒性，要维持数据流形外区域的鲁棒性，损失需要在远离数据流形处急剧弯曲。实证验证了理论预测，发现对抗样本常位于模型自信错误的平坦区域。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了对平坦性的简化理解，提供了关于其在鲁棒性中作用的细致认识：平坦性仅部分正确，不能保证全局鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 理论证明策略优化在鲁棒RL中可实现多项式次优性边界和样本效率，与基于价值的方法性能相当；实证结果验证了DR-RPO的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DR-RPO填补了鲁棒RL中策略优化的理论和实证空白，为分布偏移下的决策提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在面对未见海况时泛化能力有限，主要原因是忽略了海洋系统的自然衰减现象和对波-结构相互作用建模不足。

Method: 使用衰减双向自注意力模块模拟自然衰减，相位差引导双向交叉注意力模块捕捉波-结构相互作用，通过全局上下文融合模块整合双流，并采用混合时频损失函数进行训练。

Conclusion: PhysAttnNet作为海洋工程复杂系统预测模型的开发框架具有重要潜力，能够有效提升弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

<details>

Motivation: 随着基础模型在时间序列分析中应用增多，需要比较通用型模型（如MOMENT）与专用型模型在生理信号处理中的表现差异，特别是针对PPG信号。

Method: 通过51个任务组成的综合测试套件，从胜率、平均性能、特征质量、调优增益、性能方差、可迁移性和可扩展性等7个维度评估两种模型。

Result: 在完全微调场景下，专用模型比通用模型胜率高出27%，在心脏状态评估、实验室值估计和跨模态推理等任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 专用模型在PPG信号分析中表现更佳，研究还分析了泛化性、公平性、注意力可视化及训练数据选择的重要性。

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

Conclusion: CAST提供了一种补充现有方法的视角，通过直接矩阵估计和谱分析揭示了Transformer层的不同功能阶段和行为模式。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型归因方法需要模型梯度或重训练，限制了在专有或大规模场景下的应用，需要一种仅基于数据的归因方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供空间可解释的归因结果，揭示了训练数据与输出之间的内在关系，且独立于具体模型。

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

TL;DR: CAREBench是一个早期事件预测基准，评估多模态输入下的预测准确性和时间稳定性，发现现有方法特别是LLMs难以同时优化准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前早期事件预测系统忽略风险评分的时间稳定性，且主要评估表格输入，缺乏对风险轨迹行为的测试。

Method: 提出CAREBench基准，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），并引入基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。

Result: 现有方法特别是LLMs在准确性和稳定性联合优化方面表现不佳，在高精度操作点召回率显著较差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够产生证据对齐、稳定轨迹的模型，以在连续监测环境中赢得临床医生的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合谱残差方法和储层计算的SR-RC模型，用于时间序列异常检测，在保持学习效率的同时提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 储层计算在边缘AI应用中具有优势，但单独使用时可能需要过大的储层规模才能达到足够的异常检测性能。注意力机制能提高精度但计算量大，影响学习效率。

Method: 将谱残差方法（一种无学习的自底向上注意力机制）与储层计算相结合，形成SR-RC模型。谱残差方法不需要学习，适合硬件实现。

Result: SR-RC在基准任务和真实世界时间序列数据集上优于传统储层计算和基于谱残差特征提取的逻辑回归模型。

Conclusion: SR-RC为在边缘AI中部署储层计算进行时间序列异常检测提供了实用的方向，结合了谱残差方法的硬件友好特性。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在关键应用中的广泛使用，隐蔽的后门攻击（中毒训练输入触发恶意行为但看起来正常）构成严重安全风险。现有防御在面对基于距离的细微异常或干净样本稀缺时容易失效。

Method: TED++围绕每个类的隐藏特征流形构建管状邻域，从少量干净激活估计局部"厚度"，然后应用局部自适应排序(LAR)检测超出允许管的激活。通过聚合所有层的LAR调整排名，捕获输入在演化类子流形上的忠实度。

Result: 在基准数据集和任务上的广泛实验表明，TED++在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下实现最先进的检测性能。即使每类只有5个保留样本，TED++仍能实现近乎完美的检测，AUROC比次优方法提升高达14%。

Conclusion: TED++通过管约束行为特征有效检测隐蔽后门攻击，在数据稀缺和自适应攻击场景下表现出色，为深度神经网络安全提供了有力保障。

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at

*Daiqi Gao,Ziping Xu,Aseel Rawashdeh,Predrag Klasnja,Susan A. Murphy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了主动可观测马尔可夫决策过程（AOMDP），其中智能体不仅选择控制动作，还决定是否测量潜在状态。测量动作会揭示真实状态但可能对环境产生负面延迟影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中测量状态在现实环境中可能成本高昂，并可能对未来结果产生负面影响，因此需要一种能够权衡测量成本和收益的方法。

Method: 将AOMDP建模为周期性部分可观测MDP，提出基于信念状态的在线RL算法，并使用顺序蒙特卡洛方法近似未知静态环境参数和未观测潜在状态的后验分布。

Result: 在数字健康应用中评估了所提算法，智能体决定何时提供数字干预以及何时通过调查评估用户健康状态。

Conclusion: 尽管测量可能带来成本，但减少的不确定性可以证明提高样本效率并增加最优策略的价值。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-ERM：一种结合LLM引导搜索和ERM验证的程序学习框架，在样本效率和计算可行性上优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序学习中样本效率与计算可行性之间的平衡问题，传统方法要么搜索成本高，要么需要大量样本

Method: 提出LLM-ERM框架，使用预训练LLM生成候选程序，然后在验证集上选择最佳假设，无需梯度或反馈

Result: 在奇偶性变体、模式匹配和素数测试等任务上，仅需200个样本即可解决，而SGD训练需要10万个样本

Conclusion: 语言引导的程序合成在保持计算可行性的同时，恢复了有限类ERM的统计效率，为学习简洁假设提供了实用途径

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 提出DARTS-GT，通过非对称注意力设计和可微分架构搜索实现深度异构的图Transformer，在保持高性能的同时提供可量化的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图Transformer存在设计僵化、缺乏可量化可解释性的问题，固定GNN类型和复杂架构使得性能增益难以区分有意义的模式和虚假相关性。

Method: 重新设计图Transformer注意力为非对称结构，将结构编码与特征表示解耦，使用DARTS为每层选择最优GNN算子，实现注意力内部的深度异构。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，DARTS-GT在4个数据集上达到最先进水平，在其他数据集上保持竞争力，发现的架构揭示了数据集特定模式。

Conclusion: 图Transformer无需在性能和可解释性之间做出选择，异构架构能同时实现高性能和更好的可解释性，视觉注意力显著性与因果重要性并不总是相关。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: Stop-RAG是一个基于价值控制的迭代检索增强生成系统，能够自适应决定何时停止检索，从而减少延迟、成本和干扰证据风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代RAG方法要么使用固定迭代次数，要么依赖不能准确反映是否需要更多检索的置信度代理，导致效率低下和性能问题。

Method: 将迭代RAG建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，使用基于价值的控制器，通过完整轨迹的全宽度前向视图Q(λ)目标进行训练。

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，Stop-RAG持续优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的LLM停止方法。

Conclusion: 自适应停止是当前代理系统中的关键缺失组件，基于价值的控制能够提高RAG系统的准确性。

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为自动微分理论提供几何基础，通过微分几何的视角重新解释AD，为深度学习和科学计算中开发结构保持的微分方法奠定理论基础。

Method: 使用jet bundles和Weil代数的几何框架，将反向模式AD建模为余切拉回操作，泰勒模式建模为Weil代数中的求值。

Result: 推导出反向模式的函子恒等式、高阶导数的代数精确性、截断误差的显式界，并证明张量化Weil代数可以一次性计算所有混合导数，避免组合爆炸。

Conclusion: 该框架为AD理论提供了几何解释，并为开发结构保持的微分方法提供了基础，在深度学习和科学计算中具有应用前景。

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

*Andrew Zhao,Reshmi Ghosh,Vitor Carvalho,Emily Lawton,Keegan Hines,Gao Huang,Jack W. Stokes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析了基于LLM的提示优化中的投毒风险，发现基于反馈的攻击比注入查询攻击更危险，提出了无需访问奖励模型的假奖励攻击方法，并设计了一种轻量级高亮防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM系统广泛应用于聊天机器人、计算机助手和自主机器人等日常AI应用，性能依赖于精心设计的提示。基于LLM的提示优化器通过评分反馈迭代优化提示，但这一优化阶段的安全性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用HarmBench进行系统分析，发现系统对操纵反馈的脆弱性远高于注入查询。提出了一种无需访问奖励模型的简单假奖励攻击方法，并设计了一种轻量级高亮防御机制。

Result: 基于反馈的攻击使攻击成功率提升高达ΔASR=0.48。假奖励攻击将ΔASR从0.23提升到0.07，而轻量级高亮防御在不降低效用的情况下将假奖励ΔASR从0.23降至0.07。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明提示优化管道是一类重要的攻击面，需要为反馈渠道和优化框架提供更强的安全保障措施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题不仅发生在表示学习阶段，还显著体现在决策层，导致主导模态（如音频）压制较弱模态。研究发现这种偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅优化动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习通常面临模态不平衡问题，主导模态在联合优化过程中会压制较弱模态。本文旨在揭示这种不平衡不仅存在于表示学习阶段，更关键地体现在决策层，影响模型的最终性能。

Method: 通过在音频-视觉数据集（CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds）上进行实验，分析模型在充分预训练和平衡优化后仍存在的系统性模态偏差。进一步研究特征空间和决策权重分布的差异。

Result: 实验表明即使经过充分预训练和平衡优化，模型仍然表现出对特定模态（如音频）的系统性偏好。这种偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅由优化动态引起。

Conclusion: 在融合阶段聚合未校准的模态输出会导致决策层权重偏差，阻碍较弱模态的有效贡献。未来多模态系统应更关注在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制，根据各模态能力实现相对平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTA预测方法主要关注亲和力值的准确性，但忽略了药物与靶点之间交互效应的方向性预测，这会影响药物分配决策的质量。

Method: 引入IC-index评估指标，分析预测器对交互方向的捕捉能力；证明当预测器对药物和靶点身份具有置换等变性时，无法捕捉未见实体的交互效应。

Result: 实验表明不同亲和力强度预测方法在IC-index上的表现差异显著，IC-index能够有效补充现有预测性能评估指标。

Conclusion: IC-index为DTA预测提供了重要的交互方向评估维度，结合适当的侧信息可以改善对交互效应的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE技术虽然能有效扩展模型规模，但其巨大的内存开销使得模型压缩成为重要研究方向。

Method: 从专家输出合并的角度重新解释专家合并过程，将其视为在正向计算中插入额外矩阵，并基于此提出优化公式来构建压缩矩阵。

Result: 在多个MoE模型上评估显示，MergeMoE算法在相同压缩比下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 从输出合并角度分析专家合并过程，并基于优化方法构建压缩矩阵的MergeMoE方法能有效压缩MoE模型。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

Motivation: 挑战现有观点：虽然神经网络剪枝通常需要重训练来恢复性能，但现有LLM剪枝方法避免完全重训练，认为计算不可行。然而，重构方法在实践中往往在较粗粒度上实现。

Method: 对最先进的GPT架构进行广泛计算研究，比较不同重构或重训练策略，包括逐层重构注意力机制和MLP组件的方法。

Result: 发现"免费午餐"场景：在Transformer块内分别重构注意力和MLP组件是最资源高效的，却能达到最佳困惑度，性能甚至优于完全重训练。

Conclusion: 重构步骤的重要性超过复杂剪枝标准，挑战了"不惜一切代价避免重训练"的叙事，为LLM剪枝后性能恢复提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Result: GAN训练稳定，生成的样本能够再现沉积物的非平稳性和细节特征，没有出现模式崩溃或纯记忆训练数据的问题。沉积时间可用于验证GAN样本是否遵循叠加定律。

Conclusion: GAN在针对特定地质结构的训练数据集上比通常认为的更稳健，将深度生成模型与地质原理(如叠加定律)结合具有很大潜力。

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained
environments.

natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

*Ling Zhang,Xianliang Yang,Juwon Yu,Park Cheonyoung,Lei Song,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文近似(ICA)的理论框架，用于高效选择和重加权训练数据，无需参考模型或额外微调，在多种对齐方法中都能提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据选择方法依赖启发式或昂贵的重训练，缺乏系统高效识别高价值训练数据的方法，而噪声或偏离目标的样本会稀释监督效果。

Method: 使用In-Context Approximation(ICA)估计候选样本在训练后的holdout损失，基于局部线性化理论，将其作为数据价值的代理指标，并动态重加权梯度更新。

Result: 在SFT、DPO和SimPO等多种对齐方法中，ICA重加权方法在不同骨干网络和数据集上都能一致提升模型对齐效果，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ICA框架为数据选择和重加权提供了理论基础和高效实现，但需要注意在快速漂移的on-policy更新中的局限性，这是未来工作的方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

TL;DR: 提出可逆学习框架，通过状态可逆性度量和选择性回滚机制，提升基于价值的强化学习在部分不可逆环境中的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于价值的强化学习智能体在部分不可逆环境中容易产生价值高估和不稳定的问题，特别是对灾难性步骤的脆弱性。

Method: 包含两个核心机制：1) Phi(s,a)可逆性度量，量化在固定时间窗口内返回先前状态的可能性；2) 选择性状态回滚操作，当动作收益显著低于预期值时回滚到前一个状态。

Result: 在CliffWalking v0中减少99.8%的灾难性跌落，平均回报提升55%；在Taxi v3中抑制99.9%的非法动作，累计奖励提升65.7%，同时大幅降低奖励方差。

Conclusion: 回滚机制是实现安全和性能提升的关键组件，为安全可靠的顺序决策提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的时间序列分块方法将时间序列划分为相邻块，导致固定的表示空间，无法充分表达信息。本文旨在构建一个灵活的选择性表示空间，包含最具信息量的块用于预测。

Method: 提出SRS模块，包含可学习的选择性分块和动态重组技术，自适应地从上下文时间序列中选择和重排块。构建SRSNet模型，由SRS模块和MLP头组成。

Result: SRSNet在多个领域的真实世界数据集上实现了最先进的性能。SRS作为即插即用模块也能提升现有基于分块模型的性能。

Conclusion: SRS模块通过构建选择性表示空间，有效提升了时间序列预测的性能，且具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于先验预测矩匹配的严格方法来确定概率张量模型中的秩可识别性，将矩匹配条件转化为对数线性方程组，并应用于四种基础张量模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量分解中潜在维度（秩）的选择通常依赖启发式方法，缺乏严格的数学基础，需要一种严谨的方法来确定秩的可识别性。

Method: 将矩匹配条件转化为关于边际矩、先验超参数和秩的对数线性方程组，建立秩可识别性与方程组可解性之间的等价关系。

Result: 证明PARAFAC/CP、Tensor Train和Tensor Ring模型的秩是可识别的，而Tucker模型的秩由于对称拓扑导致系统欠定而不可识别。对于可识别模型，推导了基于观测数据矩的显式闭式秩估计器。

Conclusion: 该方法为张量分解中的秩选择提供了严格的数学基础，并通过实证验证了所提估计器的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

TL;DR: 提出了Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO)算法，通过动态熵平衡机制解决代理强化学习中熵信号过度依赖导致的训练崩溃问题，在14个数据集上优于7种主流RL算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流代理强化学习算法过度依赖熵信号来指导高不确定性工具调用步骤的探索，但这种过度依赖会施加额外约束，导致训练崩溃。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1)动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监测自适应分配全局和分支采样预算，并对连续高熵工具调用步骤施加分支惩罚；(2)熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并结合熵感知优势估计优先学习高不确定性token。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO持续优于7种主流RL算法。仅使用1K RL样本，Qwen3-14B模型在GAIA上达到47.6% Pass@1和65.0% Pass@5，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到11.2% Pass@1和26.0% Pass@5，在WebWalker上达到43.0% Pass@1和70.0% Pass@5。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性，同时保持稳定的策略熵，促进了可扩展的web代理训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

TL;DR: 提出了MX+格式，一种基于微缩放（MX）格式的非侵入式扩展，通过重新利用指数字段作为扩展尾数来处理块浮点格式中的异常值问题，在4位精度下显著提升大语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的超低位宽块浮点格式由于块中的异常值问题，难以在大语言模型服务中提供合理的性能表现，且现有解决方案往往需要侵入式修改软件框架或硬件支持有限。

Method: MX+格式基于关键洞察：异常值不需要使用其指数字段，因此可以重新利用指数字段作为扩展尾数来提高异常值元素的精度，从而在保持存储开销和速度影响可忽略的情况下提升模型性能。

Result: 评估显示MX+相比4位MX格式（MXFP4）实现了显著更高的模型性能，存储开销和速度影响可忽略，为高效LLM推理提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Conclusion: MX+是一种成本效益高且非侵入式的扩展，可以无缝集成到微缩放格式中，有效解决了块浮点格式中的异常值问题，为4位或6位MX格式提供了更好的替代选择。

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: RedOUT是一个无监督图OOD检测框架，通过结构熵和冗余感知图信息瓶颈来减少结构冗余，提升图分类中的分布外检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据和测试数据之间的分布差异导致模型在遇到分布外样本时预测不准确，现有图OOD检测方法受结构冗余影响性能受限。

Method: 提出RedOUT框架，集成结构熵到测试时OOD检测中，引入冗余感知图信息瓶颈(ReGIB)，将目标分解为本质信息和无关冗余，通过最小化结构熵减少解耦的冗余。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验显示RedOUT在OOD检测上表现优越，平均提升6.7%，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集对上显著超越最佳竞争对手17.3%。

Conclusion: RedOUT通过结构熵和ReGIB有效减少结构冗余，显著提升了图分类中的OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Motivation: Transformer在处理表格数据时存在序列长度的二次复杂度问题，而状态空间模型虽然效率高，但对输入顺序敏感，这在表格数据中是不希望的特性。

Method: 采用Hydra双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型作为Transformer的替代方案，通过双向上下文聚合来减少对输入顺序的依赖。

Result: 该方法显著降低了对输入顺序的依赖性，预测性能与原始TabPFN模型相当。

Conclusion: 双向状态空间模型可以作为Transformer的有效替代方案，在保持效率的同时减少对输入顺序的敏感性，达到与原始模型相当的预测性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Conformal Labeling的新方法，通过控制AI标签子集中的错误发现率(FDR)，为AI预测提供可证明的可靠性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型标签质量不可靠的问题，现有选择性标注方法缺乏对AI分配标签质量的理论保证，导致AI标签子集中错误率过高。

Method: 构建每个测试实例的conformal p值，通过比较AI模型的预测置信度与校准实例中被AI误标的置信度，选择p值低于数据相关阈值的测试实例。

Result: 实验表明该方法在各种任务（图像和文本标注、LLM问答）中实现了严格的FDR控制和高功效。

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling方法能够可靠地控制FDR在名义水平以下，确保AI分配标签中预定义比例的正确性。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal

Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and

Motivation: 现有transformer设计在张量并行训练中存在显著的通信开销，特别是MHA-MLP连接需要all-reduce通信，影响训练效率。

Method: FAL架构将第一层MHA输出重定向到后续层的MLP输入，消除每块的MHA-MLP连接；FAL+在FAL基础上将归一化的第一注意力输出添加到后续层MHA输出中，增强MLP输入质量。

Result: FAL减少多GPU训练时间达44%，单GPU吞吐量提升1.18倍，困惑度优于基线GPT；FAL+在不增加训练时间的情况下实现更低的困惑度。

Conclusion: FAL和FAL+通过消除MHA-MLP连接有效减少通信开销，提高训练效率，同时保持或改善模型质量。

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

Conclusion: LeapFactual方法具有广泛适用性，能够增强科学知识发现和非专家可解释性，为需要人类注释者参与的领域（如公民科学）扩展了反事实解释的范围。

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

Motivation: 星系形态研究对理解星系演化至关重要，但传统机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，无法提供决策过程的洞察。

Method: 扩展经典编码器-解码器架构，加入可逆流组件，实现反事实解释功能。

Result: 该方法不仅能获得良好的预测性能，还能提供关于决策过程的额外信息。

Conclusion: 提出的可逆流扩展架构为星系形态分类提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Galaxy morphologies play an essential role in the study of the evolution of
galaxies. The determination of morphologies is laborious for a large amount of
data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of
these approaches offer no insight into how the model works and make the results
difficult to understand and explain. We here propose to extend a classical
encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow, allowing us to not only
obtain a good predictive performance but also provide additional information
about the decision process with counterfactual explanations.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于黎曼几何的无监督域自适应方法，通过Siegel嵌入将一阶和二阶矩表示为对称正定矩阵，在SPD矩阵流形上使用自然几何距离进行分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督域自适应中的分布偏移问题，现有方法使用临时相似性度量在嵌入空间中对齐低阶统计矩，缺乏几何原理性。

Method: 将源域和目标域的一阶和二阶矩表示为对称正定矩阵，在SPD矩阵流形上使用黎曼距离进行分布对齐，通过Siegel嵌入实现同时适应两个矩。

Result: 在图像去噪和图像分类基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，连接了黎曼流形距离与目标域误差边界。

Conclusion: 提出的几何自适应方法能够更忠实地进行跨域比较，保持源域和目标域的均值和协方差结构，为无监督域自适应提供了原理性替代方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

TL;DR: 提出FedPPA方法解决联邦学习中模型和数据异构性问题，通过渐进参数对齐和基于熵的加权平均来提升个性化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实联邦学习场景中客户端计算资源异构且数据非独立同分布，现有个性化联邦学习方法未能同时处理模型和数据异构性问题

Method: FedPPA方法：1) 渐进式对齐客户端与全局模型的公共层权重；2) 集成基于熵的加权平均来增强全局模型性能

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FedPPA在个性化适应方面持续优于现有联邦学习算法

Conclusion: FedPPA能有效缓解客户端更新时的全局-局部模型不一致性，同时保留客户端本地知识，在非IID设置下增强个性化鲁棒性

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Seesaw框架，通过将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批处理大小来替代传统学习率减半策略，在保持损失动态的同时减少串行步骤，加速大语言模型预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批处理大小增加是加速大语言模型预训练的有前景策略，但对于自适应优化器如Adam的最优策略尚不明确，当前方法通常需要启发式调优。

Method: 开发了批处理大小调度的原则性框架Seesaw：当标准调度器要减半学习率时，Seesaw改为将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批处理大小。理论分析了SGD和归一化SGD在噪声线性回归上的学习率衰减与批处理大小增加的等价性。

Result: 在150M/300M/600M参数模型上，使用恒定（临界）批处理大小进行Chinchilla规模训练时，Seesaw在相同FLOPs下与余弦衰减匹配，同时减少约36%的墙上时间，接近理论极限。

Conclusion: Seesaw框架为批处理大小调度提供了理论依据，有效加速大语言模型预训练，接近理论最优性能。

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

### [181] [Tawa: Automatic Warp Specialization for Modern GPUs with Asynchronous References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14719)
*Hongzheng Chen,Bin Fan,Alexander Collins,Bastian Hagedorn,Evghenii Gaburov,Masahiro Masuda,Matthew Brookhart,Chris Sullivan,Jason Knight,Zhiru Zhang,Vinod Grover*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tawa是一个自动化编译器，能够从高级瓦片化程序自动生成高性能的warp专用代码，解决了GPU SIMT编程模型与任务并行硬件之间的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU具有支持高性能异步数据流执行的专用硬件单元，但传统的SIMT编程模型与这种任务并行硬件存在根本性不匹配，形成了显著的可编程性差距。硬件级的warp专用化虽然能解锁峰值性能，但要求开发者手动编排复杂的低级通信和软件管道，这过程劳动密集、容易出错且不可持续。

Method: Tawa采用新颖的IR抽象——异步引用(aref)来表达warp级通信，无需暴露低级硬件细节。使用这种抽象，Tawa自动将程序划分为生产者-消费者角色，并管理复杂的数据流管道，避免了侵入式内核重写。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上对代表性LLM内核的评估显示，Tawa实现了高硬件利用率，相比高度优化的cuBLAS GEMM内核实现了最高1.1倍加速。对于注意力工作负载，Tawa相比Triton实现了1.2倍加速，并且与手工优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3内核性能相当，但编程工作量大幅减少。

Conclusion: Tawa通过自动化的warp专用化代码生成，成功弥合了GPU编程模型与硬件能力之间的差距，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了编程复杂度。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

TL;DR: INDAGO-Nexus是一个多目标搜索方法，用于发现深度强化学习代理的多样化故障场景，相比单目标优化的INDAGO能发现更多独特故障并减少故障发现时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具如INDAGO仅关注最大化故障数量，无法确保发现的场景具有多样性或揭示不同的错误类型。

Method: 使用多目标进化算法，联合优化故障可能性和测试场景多样性，采用多种多样性指标和Pareto前沿选择策略。

Result: 在三个DRL代理上评估，INDAGO-Nexus在SDC和停车场景中分别比INDAGO多发现83%和40%的独特故障，所有代理的故障发现时间减少高达67%。

Conclusion: 多目标搜索方法能更有效地发现多样化故障场景，提高测试效果和效率。

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下一词预测在长程推理、规划和创意写作方面存在局限，多词预测只能捕捉短程依赖关系，改进有限。需要一种能保留长期未来相关信息的方法。

Method: 提出未来摘要预测(FSP)，训练辅助头来预测长期未来的紧凑表示。探索两种变体：手工制作摘要（如词袋摘要）和学习摘要（使用从右到左训练的反向语言模型生成的嵌入）。

Result: 在大规模预训练实验（30亿和80亿参数模型）中，FSP在数学、推理和编程基准测试上均优于下一词预测和多词预测。

Conclusion: FSP通过预测长期未来的紧凑表示，有效提升了语言模型的长程推理能力，为改进语言模型的长形式生成提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian

methods, our approach adaptively guides a mobile agent to collect high-utility
Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and
mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by
incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to
high-acquisition planned paths. Simulations on realistic urban scenarios show
that the proposed method achieves accurate localization with fewer measurements

Motivation: 传统Hebbian学习在机器学习中存在连接更新不受约束和缺乏反馈调节的问题，限制了其在复杂网络架构和任务中的有效扩展。

Method: 引入结构投影Hebbian表示(SPHeRe)，通过局部辅助非线性块整合正交性和结构信息保留，使用轻量级投影进行反馈调节，正交性约束控制更新幅度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等标准图像分类基准测试中达到无监督突触可塑性方法的SOTA性能，在持续学习和迁移学习场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了Hebbian无监督学习规则在现代深度学习框架中的竞争力和潜力，展示了无需严格依赖反向传播的高效生物启发学习算法的可能性。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合学习排列矩阵的结构化稀疏训练方法PA-DST，在保持高精度的同时显著提升训练和推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏虽然能加速GPU上的训练和推理，但在精度上仍落后于非结构化动态稀疏训练，主要原因是表达能力受限

Method: 为每个层学习一个排列矩阵与结构化权重矩阵联合训练，应用于块、N:M和对角线三种典型结构

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上，PA-DST在90-95%稀疏度下达到与非结构化基线相当的精度，同时训练速度提升1.21倍，推理速度提升2.9倍

Conclusion: 结构+学习排列的组合在精度和效率之间找到了最佳平衡点

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 时间序列数据具有动态特性，存在概念漂移和时间偏移两种分布偏移。现有研究主要关注时间偏移，而针对时间序列预测的概念漂移方法研究相对较少。

Method: 提出ShifTS框架：1）先处理时间偏移作为前提；2）使用软注意力机制从回看和预测时间序列中寻找不变模式来处理概念漂移；3）框架与具体方法无关。

Conclusion: ShifTS框架通过先处理时间偏移再解决概念漂移的统一方法，有效提升了时间序列预测的准确性，为处理时间序列中的分布偏移提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型依赖特征工程，神经网络能自动学习特征但缺乏可解释性且需要专用硬件。需要一种既能自动学习有用特征又保持可解释性的方法。

Method: 使用LLM生成特征函数代码，结合决策树构建LeaPR模型。提出两种算法：FunSearch的改进版本学习特征，以及ID3的变体在分裂节点时按需生成新特征。

Result: 在象棋位置评估、图像和文本分类等任务中，LeaPR模型学习到高质量的非神经网络预测器，性能通常与神经网络相当。

Conclusion: LeaPR提供了一种灵活的学习可解释表示的范式，特征和预测都可以被轻松检查和理解，为自动特征学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Conclusion: 虽然纯SSMs在理论上存在长序列生成限制，但通过工具增强可以克服这一局限，使SSMs成为交互式工具环境中Transformer的高效替代方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Motivation: 基础模型对对抗性扰动和后门攻击高度脆弱，但大规模模型无法重新训练以确保安全。现有后门移除方法依赖昂贵的微调，会损害其他任务的性能。

Method: 研究发现后门在模型权重空间中与良性任务是解耦的，基于此提出简单的无学习方法，通过隔离和擦除后门影响来移除后门。

Result: 在CLIP模型和常见对抗性触发器的实验中，该方法实现了近乎完美的后门移除，同时平均保留96%的干净准确率，即使攻击未知时也能通过反向工程成功移除。

Conclusion: 该方法在无学习和干净准确率权衡方面优于现有最先进防御方法，证明了后门移除可以不损害模型通用能力。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

Motivation: 研究核回归在真实数据集上的学习曲线预测问题，旨在建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端理论框架。

Method: 提出HEA方法，通过分析近似核的特征值和特征函数，利用各向异性数据分布下的Hermite多项式特征结构来预测学习曲线。

Result: 在CIFAR-5m、SVHN和ImageNet等数据集上验证HEA的有效性，发现真实图像数据足够接近高斯分布，HEA能准确预测学习曲线。

Conclusion: HEA框架证明了在真实数据集上建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端学习理论是可行的，且MLP在特征学习阶段也遵循HEA预测的Hermite多项式学习顺序。

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

Motivation: 在高风险AI应用中，标准赌博机算法的激进探索可能导致不可逆损害，而现有依赖导师的方法存在可用性问题。

Method: 使用两动作上下文赌博机模型，包含弃权选项和提交选项，通过建立可信区域并仅在证据充足时提交来确保安全。

Result: 在i.i.d.输入假设下，算法实现了次线性遗憾保证，证明了谨慎探索在高风险环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 谨慎探索策略能够在无导师情况下安全部署学习代理，避免不可逆损害，同时保持学习效率。

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

Result: 在MATH500、HumanEval、GPQA等任务上显著提升推理能力，性能接近甚至超过RL后训练，且避免了RL训练中的多样性崩溃问题

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、精选数据集或验证器，在不易验证的领域具有广泛适用性

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Motivation: 现有可解释性方法依赖人工检查且仅限于简单任务，自动化方法虽然可扩展但常忽略特征间交互且依赖外部LLM和数据集质量。

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

Conclusion: 循环深度模型可自然地视为强大的连续（尽管是因果的）扩散语言模型，为并行化额外计算提供了高效机制。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用恒等链接函数（identity link）而非传统的logit/probit链接来构建项目反应理论模型，以保持TVD-MI成对比较的加性结构，从而实现更高效的大语言模型评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的IRT模型使用非线性链接函数（如logit、probit）会破坏TVD-MI成对比较的加性结构，导致模型拟合失真。本文旨在找到能保持这种几何结构的更合适的链接函数。

Method: 通过经验分析比较不同链接函数对加性结构的破坏程度，提出基于Gini熵最大化的剪裁线性模型，采用盒约束最小二乘公式处理边界饱和问题。

Result: 恒等链接函数在三个领域的中位数curl为0.080-0.150，显著优于logit/probit的0.245-0.588。在33%覆盖率下，保持out RMSE为0.117±0.008，Spearman相关系数达0.972±0.015。

Conclusion: TVD-MI的几何结构最适合通过恒等映射来保持，这种方法不仅适用于大语言模型评估，也可推广到其他有界响应领域。

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了生物信息神经网络(BINNs)在作物基因组预测和选择中的应用，通过整合SNPs、多组学数据和先验生物知识，在训练时使用多组学数据，推理时仅需基因型数据，显著提高了预测准确性并揭示了非线性生物学关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因型到表型(G2P)模型预测精度有限，依赖昂贵的田间试验。虽然结合分子表型数据可以提高预测拟合度，但这些数据在部署时不可用。BINNs旨在克服这一限制，利用训练时的多组学数据和生物通路先验知识，仅需基因型数据即可进行推理。

Method: BINNs通过编码通路级归纳偏置，在训练时利用多组学数据，推理时仅使用基因型数据。应用于玉米基因表达和多环境田间试验数据，在稀疏数据条件下评估性能，并与GWAS/TWAS方法比较。

Result: BINNs在稀疏数据条件下将排序相关准确性提高了56%，在合成代谢组学基准测试中将预测误差降低了75%。能够识别GWAS/TWAS无法发现的非线性基因，且潜在变量与实验量高度相关。

Conclusion: BINNs建立了一个利用中间领域信息提高基因组预测准确性的框架，揭示了可以指导基因组选择、候选基因选择、通路富集和基因编辑优先级的非线性生物学关系。

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

Motivation: 传统少步扩散或流模型蒸馏存在输出格式不匹配问题，导致复杂的蒸馏过程和质量-多样性权衡，需要更简单有效的解决方案。

Method: 修改学生流模型输出层预测无网络策略，在子步生成动态流速度；引入模仿蒸馏方法，使用标准ℓ₂流匹配损失匹配策略轨迹与教师模型。

Result: 在ImageNet 256²上实现1-NFE FID为2.85，优于相同DiT架构的MeanFlow；在FLUX.1-12B和Qwen-Image-20B上，4 NFEs时获得比最先进少步方法更好的多样性，同时保持教师级质量。

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单的模仿教师行为实现了稳定可扩展的训练，避免了质量-多样性权衡，在少步生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

Abstract: The growing demand for parking has increased the need for automated parking
planning methods that can operate reliably in confined spaces. In restricted
and complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a
high success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit
action modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal
action distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined
planner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in
which an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize
the diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising
process refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By
steering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior
distribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed
initialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning
success rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across
parking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly improves planning performance
in confined-space parking environments while maintaining strong generalization
in common scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for designing spatially intelligent robot
swarm behaviors to localize concealed radio emitters. We use differential
evolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals
independently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic
surveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information
gain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We
simulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning
pre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing
capability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed
within the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and
frequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are
driven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with
failures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of
the map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their
higher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75%
compared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from
1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional
sensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges.
These results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic
phenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the
environment. Consequently, spatial intelligence, realized here through
optimized patrol routes and antenna selection, is a critical design
consideration for effective robotic surveillance.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Task Assignment and Planning (MATP) has attracted growing
attention but remains challenging in terms of scalability, spatial reasoning,
and adaptability in obstacle-rich environments. To address these challenges, we
propose OATH: Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Task Assignment and Planning for
Heterogeneous Robot Teaming, which advances MATP by introducing a novel
obstacle-aware strategy for task assignment. First, we develop an adaptive
Halton sequence map, the first known application of Halton sampling with
obstacle-aware adaptation in MATP, which adjusts sampling density based on
obstacle distribution. Second, we propose a cluster-auction-selection framework
that integrates obstacle-aware clustering with weighted auctions and
intra-cluster task selection. These mechanisms jointly enable effective
coordination among heterogeneous robots while maintaining scalability and
near-optimal allocation performance. In addition, our framework leverages an
LLM to interpret human instructions and directly guide the planner in real
time. We validate OATH in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, showing substantial improvements in
task assignment quality, scalability, adaptability to dynamic changes, and
overall execution performance compared to state-of-the-art MATP baselines. A

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将强化学习技能集成到任务与运动规划中的方法，通过数据驱动的逻辑组件和计划细化子程序来处理概率性技能的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务与运动规划在处理具有不确定性的概率性动作时面临挑战，而强化学习擅长获取鲁棒的短视界操作技能但缺乏长视界推理能力。

Method: 设计将RL技能集成到TAMP流程的方法，定义包含数据驱动逻辑组件的RL技能，并设计计划细化子程序处理效果不确定性。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够将TAMP能力扩展到具有概率性技能的领域，并相比先前方法提高了规划效率。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入RL技能，成功扩展了TAMP在概率性技能领域的能力，同时提升了规划效率。

Abstract: Task and motion planning (TAMP) for robotics manipulation necessitates
long-horizon reasoning involving versatile actions and skills. While
deterministic actions can be crafted by sampling or optimizing with certain
constraints, planning actions with uncertainty, i.e., probabilistic actions,
remains a challenge for TAMP. On the contrary, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
excels in acquiring versatile, yet short-horizon, manipulation skills that are
robust with uncertainties. In this letter, we design a method that integrates
RL skills into TAMP pipelines. Besides the policy, a RL skill is defined with
data-driven logical components that enable the skill to be deployed by symbolic
planning. A plan refinement sub-routine is designed to further tackle the
inevitable effect uncertainties. In the experiments, we compare our method with
baseline hierarchical planning from both TAMP and RL fields and illustrate the
strength of the method. The results show that by embedding RL skills, we extend
the capability of TAMP to domains with probabilistic skills, and improve the
planning efficiency compared to the previous methods.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel control approach based on partial feedback
linearization (PFL) for the stabilization of a suspended aerial platform with
an attached load. Such systems are envisioned for various applications in
construction sites involving cranes, such as the holding and transportation of
heavy objects. Our proposed control approach considers the underactuation of
the whole system while utilizing its coupled dynamics for stabilization. We
demonstrate using numerical stability analysis that these coupled terms are
crucial for the stabilization of the complete system. We also carried out
robustness analysis of the proposed approach in the presence of external wind
disturbances, sensor noise, and uncertainties in system dynamics. As our
envisioned target application involves cranes in outdoor construction sites,
our control approaches rely on only onboard sensors, thus making it suitable
for such applications. We carried out extensive simulation studies and
experimental tests to validate our proposed control approach.

Conclusion: ViTacGen框架能够消除对高分辨率真实触觉传感器的依赖，实现视觉机器人系统的有效零样本部署。

Abstract: Robotic pushing is a fundamental manipulation task that requires tactile
feedback to capture subtle contact forces and dynamics between the end-effector
and the object. However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations
such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving
calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only
policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to
infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot
manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch
generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on
high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment
on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an
encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth
images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image
sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile
data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile
observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation
and real world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and
achieving a success rate of up to 86\%.

TL;DR: 该论文将先进的智能交通代理模型SMART集成到nuPlan中，首次在更真实的条件下评估规划器，并量化了缩小仿真与现实差距时结论的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的交通代理（如IDM）行为简单被动，会掩盖规划器缺陷并产生评估偏差，无法测试复杂的交互能力。

Method: 将最先进的学习型交通代理模型SMART集成到nuPlan仿真平台中，替代传统的IDM代理，在14个近期规划器和基准方法上进行闭环仿真评估。

Result: 基于IDM的仿真高估了规划性能：几乎所有评分都下降。但在多车道、交互密集场景中，许多规划器表现优于预期。学习型规划器在训练场景中表现最佳，但在边缘案例中会突然退化。

Conclusion: 建议将SMART反应式仿真作为nuPlan的新标准闭环基准，并发布了SMART代理作为IDM的直接替代方案。

Abstract: Planner evaluation in closed-loop simulation often uses rule-based traffic
agents, whose simplistic and passive behavior can hide planner deficiencies and
bias rankings. Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot
react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction
capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned
traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate
planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift
when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and
established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates
planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners
interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane,
interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in
closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However,
when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned
planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable
basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a
new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a
drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.

Abstract: Manipulating three-dimensional (3D) deformable objects presents significant
challenges for robotic systems due to their infinite-dimensional state space
and complex deformable dynamics. This paper proposes a novel model-free
approach for shape control with constraints imposed on key points. Unlike
existing methods that rely on feature dimensionality reduction, the proposed
controller leverages the coordinates of key points as the feature vector, which
are extracted from the deformable object's point cloud using deep learning
methods. This approach not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature space
but also retains the spatial information of the object. By extracting key
points, the manipulation of deformable objects is simplified into a visual
servoing problem, where the shape dynamics are described using a deformation
Jacobian matrix. To enhance control accuracy, a prescribed performance control
method is developed by integrating barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) to enforce
constraints on the key points. The stability of the closed-loop system is
rigorously analyzed and verified using the Lyapunov method. Experimental
results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
method.

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in
healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human
collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling
compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to
humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader
and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a
closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object
motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant
collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning.
We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world
experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness,
generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and
objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort
by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability.
Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different
object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns
(straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23
participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline
models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying
without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a
practical solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are experiencing rapid development and
demonstrating promising capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks. However,
scaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new
VLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and
extensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes
particularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights
during the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing
model capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We
propose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits
pretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by
substituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE
employs a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert
weighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the
traditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance
while contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing
collaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our
approach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through
collaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while
maintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the
baseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on
LIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement
in real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we study risk-aware reinforcement learning for quadrupedal
locomotion. Our approach trains a family of risk-conditioned policies using a
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constrained policy optimization technique that
provides improved stability and sample efficiency. At deployment, we adaptively
select the best performing policy from the family of policies using a
multi-armed bandit framework that uses only observed episodic returns, without
any privileged environment information, and adapts to unknown conditions on the
fly. Hence, we train quadrupedal locomotion policies at various levels of
robustness using CVaR and adaptively select the desired level of robustness
online to ensure performance in unknown environments. We evaluate our method in
simulation across eight unseen settings (by changing dynamics, contacts,
sensing noise, and terrain) and on a Unitree Go2 robot in previously unseen
terrains. Our risk-aware policy attains nearly twice the mean and tail
performance in unseen environments compared to other baselines and our
bandit-based adaptation selects the best-performing risk-aware policy in
unknown terrain within two minutes of operation.

Abstract: Agricultural robots are emerging as powerful assistants across a wide range
of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or
fixed rail systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark
pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural
domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the
natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation
instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an
independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide
spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method
of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation
(SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save
spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on
the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47
to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m,
demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Abstract: This study presents a powered transtibial prosthesis with complete push-off
assistance, RoboANKLE. The design aims to fulfill specific requirements, such
as a sufficient range of motion (RoM) while providing the necessary torque for
achieving natural ankle motion in daily activities. Addressing the challenges
faced in designing active transtibial prostheses, such as maintaining energetic
autonomy and minimizing weight, is vital for the study. With this aim, we try
to imitate the human ankle by providing extensive push-off assistance to
achieve a natural-like torque profile. Thus, Energy Store and Extended Release
mechanism (ESER) is employed with a novel Extra Energy Storage (EES) mechanism.
Kinematic and kinetic analyses are carried out to determine the design
parameters and assess the design performance. Subsequently, a Computer-Aided
Design (CAD) model is built and used in comprehensive dynamic and structural
analyses. These analyses are used for the design performance evaluation and
determine the forces and torques applied to the prosthesis, which aids in
optimizing the design for minimal weight via structural analysis and topology
optimization. The design of the prototype is then finalized and manufactured
for experimental evaluation to validate the design and functionality. The
prototype is realized with a mass of 1.92 kg and dimensions of 261x107x420 mm.
The Functional evaluations of the RoboANKLE revealed that it is capable of
achieving the natural maximum dorsi-flexion angle with 95% accuracy. Also,
Thanks to the implemented mechanisms, the results show that RoboANKLE can
generate 57% higher than the required torque for natural walking. The result of
the power generation capacity of the RoboANKLE is 10% more than the natural
power during the gait cycle.

Conclusion: AdaMimic成功实现了从单一参考运动的高精度运动模仿和强适应性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to adapt demonstrated motions to diverse
real-world conditions while accurately preserving motion patterns. Existing
motion prior approaches enable well adaptability with a few motions but often
sacrifice imitation accuracy, whereas motion-tracking methods achieve accurate
imitation yet require many training motions and a test-time target motion to
adapt. To combine their strengths, we introduce AdaMimic, a novel motion
tracking algorithm that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single
reference motion. To reduce data dependence while ensuring adaptability, our
method first creates an augmented dataset by sparsifying the single reference
motion into keyframes and applying light editing with minimal physical
assumptions. A policy is then initialized by tracking these sparse keyframes to
generate dense intermediate motions, and adapters are subsequently trained to
adjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions based on the adjustment,
enabling flexible time warping that further improves imitation accuracy and
adaptability. We validate these significant improvements in our approach in
both simulation and the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot in multiple tasks
across a wide range of adaptation conditions. Videos and code are available at

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn a policy from expert demonstrations and
has been applied to various applications. By learning from the expert policy,
IL methods do not require environmental interactions or reward signals.
However, most existing imitation learning algorithms assume perfect expert
demonstrations, but expert demonstrations often contain imperfections caused by
errors from human experts or sensor/control system inaccuracies. To address the
above problems, this work proposes a filter-and-restore framework to best
leverage expert demonstrations with inherent noise. Our proposed method first
filters clean samples from the demonstrations and then learns conditional
diffusion models to recover the noisy ones. We evaluate our proposed framework
and existing methods in various domains, including robot arm manipulation,
dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. The experiment results show that our
proposed framework consistently outperforms existing methods across all the
tasks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component
and demonstrate the framework's robustness to different noise types and levels.
These results confirm the practical applicability of our framework to noisy
offline demonstration data.

Method: 通过频域分析和数值模拟，识别系统的稳定性条件，并通过机器人执行类人运动的实验验证。

Result: 发现增加刚度会非线性地降低最大可容忍时延，使系统更易失稳；实验显示稳定性与运动性能相关。

Conclusion: 提出的稳定性标准可推广到多种机器人介导的交互场景，为有效的时延补偿策略提供了前提条件。

Abstract: This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated
human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication
under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported
by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and
delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees
stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is
characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The
criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters,
where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear
manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be
generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design
guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing
human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and
motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for
effective delay-compensation strategies.

Abstract: Embeddings from Visual-Language Models are increasingly utilized to represent
semantics in robotic maps, offering an open-vocabulary scene understanding that
surpasses traditional, limited labels. Embeddings enable on-demand querying by
comparing embedded user text prompts to map embeddings via a similarity metric.
The key challenge in performing the task indicated in a query is that the robot
must determine the parts of the environment relevant to the query.
  This paper proposes a solution to this challenge. We leverage
natural-language synonyms and antonyms associated with the query within the
embedding space, applying heuristics to estimate the language space relevant to
the query, and use that to train a classifier to partition the environment into
matches and non-matches. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments,
querying both maps and standard image benchmarks. The results demonstrate
increased queryability of maps and images. Our querying technique is agnostic
to the representation and encoder used, and requires limited training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖CAD模型或平面支撑假设，限制了泛化能力和抓取放置的统一推理，无法适应真实世界的感知噪声。

Method: 从原始几何中提取支撑表面生成多方向放置候选，采样满足碰撞和稳定性约束的接触点，通过条件抓取评分实现统一推理。

Result: 在未见过的真实物体和非平面支撑上，该方法在预测稳定性损失方面达到与CAD相当的精度，产生比学习型预测器更物理合理的放置。

Conclusion: 该方法无需形状先验，直接从噪声点云评估放置姿态，实现了模型无关的统一抓取-放置推理，在真实场景中表现优异。

Abstract: To reliably pick and place unknown objects under real-world sensing noise
remains a challenging task, as existing methods rely on strong object priors
(e.g., CAD models), or planar-support assumptions, limiting generalization and
unified reasoning between grasping and placing. In this work, we introduce a
generalized placeability metric that evaluates placement poses directly from
noisy point clouds, without any shape priors. The metric jointly scores
stability, graspability, and clearance. From raw geometry, we extract the
support surfaces of the object to generate diverse candidates for
multi-orientation placement and sample contacts that satisfy collision and
stability constraints. By conditioning grasp scores on each candidate
placement, our proposed method enables model-free unified pick-and-place
reasoning and selects grasp-place pairs that lead to stable, collision-free
placements. On unseen real objects and non-planar object supports, our metric
delivers CAD-comparable accuracy in predicting stability loss and generally
produces more physically plausible placements than learning-based predictors.

Motivation: 传统时间序列处理方法难以捕捉机器人本体感觉信号间的复杂相关性和步态依赖模式，需要一种能保留机器人形态结构并增强特征表达的表示方法。

Method: 将多通道本体感觉信号（关节位置、IMU读数、足部速度等）按机器人形态结构空间排列编码为二维图像，利用CNN处理这种跨模态表示。

Result: 在真实世界和仿真环境中，图像表示方法相比传统序列模型显著提升了预测精度和泛化能力，接触状态准确率从87.7%提升至94.5%，且窗口大小缩短15倍。

Conclusion: 跨模态编码策略在机器人状态学习中具有巨大潜力，图像表示能有效捕捉信号间相关性和步态模式，为运动相关任务提供更丰富的特征空间。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for representing proprioceptive
time-series data from quadruped robots as structured two-dimensional images,
enabling the use of convolutional neural networks for learning
locomotion-related tasks. The proposed method encodes temporal dynamics from
multiple proprioceptive signals, such as joint positions, IMU readings, and
foot velocities, while preserving the robot's morphological structure in the
spatial arrangement of the image. This transformation captures inter-signal
correlations and gait-dependent patterns, providing a richer feature space than
direct time-series processing. We apply this concept in the problem of contact
estimation, a key capability for stable and adaptive locomotion on diverse
terrains. Experimental evaluations on both real-world datasets and simulated
environments show that our image-based representation consistently enhances
prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models,
underscoring the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for robotic state
learning. Our method achieves superior performance on the contact dataset,
improving contact state accuracy from 87.7% to 94.5% over the recently proposed
MI-HGNN method, using a 15 times shorter window size.

Motivation: 在非结构化环境中实现鲁棒的人形机器人运动需要平衡快速低级稳定和慢速感知决策的架构

Method: 采用分层控制架构：高频本体感觉稳定器与紧凑低频感知策略结合，通过两阶段训练课程（盲稳定器预训练后感知微调）

Result: 分层策略在仿真和硬件测试中始终优于单阶段替代方案，在Unitree G1人形机器人上成功完成楼梯和边缘任务，而单阶段感知策略失败

Conclusion: 时间尺度的架构分离，而非网络规模或复杂性，是实现鲁棒感知条件运动的关键因素

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires
architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual
decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a
proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate
perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than
monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders.
Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed
by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently
outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree
G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage
perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation
of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for
robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

Motivation: 传统运动规划方法在高维状态空间和复杂环境中扩展性差，现有扩散模型方法大多针对单一环境训练，缺乏泛化能力，或依赖特定传感器

Method: 使用无分类器去噪概率扩散模型，通过注意力机制在U-Net架构中整合传感器无关的上下文信息，可处理任意数量的上下文参数

Result: 在7自由度机械臂上评估，相比最先进方法，能在更短时间内生成高质量多模态轨迹，并能泛化到未见环境

Conclusion: CAMPD方法有效解决了运动规划中的泛化问题，无需重新训练即可适应多样化场景，展示了扩散模型在机器人运动规划中的潜力

Abstract: Classical methods in robot motion planning, such as sampling-based and
optimization-based methods, often struggle with scalability towards
higher-dimensional state spaces and complex environments. Diffusion models,
known for their capability to learn complex, high-dimensional and multi-modal
data distributions, provide a promising alternative when applied to motion
planning problems and have already shown interesting results. However, most of
the current approaches train their model for a single environment, limiting
their generalization to environments not seen during training. The techniques
that do train a model for multiple environments rely on a specific camera to
provide the model with the necessary environmental information and therefore
always require that sensor. To effectively adapt to diverse scenarios without
the need for retraining, this research proposes Context-Aware Motion Planning
Diffusion (CAMPD). CAMPD leverages a classifier-free denoising probabilistic
diffusion model, conditioned on sensor-agnostic contextual information. An
attention mechanism, integrated in the well-known U-Net architecture,
conditions the model on an arbitrary number of contextual parameters. CAMPD is
evaluated on a 7-DoF robot manipulator and benchmarked against state-of-the-art
approaches on real-world tasks, showing its ability to generalize to unseen
environments and generate high-quality, multi-modal trajectories, at a fraction
of the time required by existing methods.

TL;DR: CBF-RL框架通过在训练中强制执行控制屏障函数(CBFs)，将安全约束内化到强化学习策略中，无需在线安全过滤器即可实现安全部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习(RL)往往以牺牲安全性为代价追求性能，而实际部署中的安全违规可能导致灾难性后果。虽然控制屏障函数(CBFs)提供了原则性的在线安全过滤方法，但RL策略不了解CBF会导致保守行为。

Method: 提出CBF-RL框架：1)通过CBF项最小化修改名义RL策略以编码安全约束；2)在训练中对策略rollouts进行安全过滤。理论上证明连续时间安全过滤器可以通过闭式表达式在离散时间rollouts上部署。

Result: CBF-RL在导航任务和Unitree G1人形机器人上验证，实现了更安全的探索、更快的收敛和鲁棒性能，使机器人能够在没有运行时安全过滤器的情况下安全避开障碍物和爬楼梯。

Conclusion: CBF-RL框架成功将安全约束内化到学习策略中，既强制执行更安全的动作，又偏向更安全的奖励，无需在线安全过滤器即可实现安全部署。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often
prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead
to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally
deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior,
the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to
conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating
safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key
attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety
constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in
training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be
deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,
we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned
policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --
enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We
validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster
convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid
robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without
a runtime safety filter.

Motivation: 解决机器人作为智能助手在家庭环境中进行物体放置任务时，需要同时考虑语义偏好（常识性物体关系）和几何可行性（碰撞避免）的挑战。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型将人类指令和视觉输入转换为结构化计划，通过空间映射器生成3D可操作性地图，利用基于扩散的规划器生成放置位姿，并引入可扩展的数据增强管道。

Conclusion: GOPLA框架通过结合语义推理和几何约束，有效解决了物体放置任务，展示了在真实机器人场景中的优异性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with
everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the
task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic
preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility
(e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that
learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A
multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual
inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These
plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by
a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses
guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision
avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that
expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data.
Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates
by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning
accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across
a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

Conclusion: 基于检索的演示分解器能够有效解决子任务分解中的对齐问题，提升分层视觉-语言-动作框架的性能。

Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action
(VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to
decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level
visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned
to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task
demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic
rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the
training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To
address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer
(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning
the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the
training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,
demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are

Abstract: We present a generative predictive control (GPC) framework that amortizes

conditional flow-matching models trained on SPC control sequences collected in
simulation. Unlike prior work relying on iterative refinement or gradient-based
solvers, we show that meaningful proposal distributions can be learned directly
from noisy SPC data, enabling more efficient and informed sampling during
online planning. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the application of
this approach to real-world contact-rich loco-manipulation with a quadruped
robot. Extensive experiments in simulation and on hardware show that our method
improves sample efficiency, reduces planning horizon requirements, and
generalizes robustly across task variations.

Conclusion: 空间锚定的触觉表示能够实现精确的几何推理，为灵巧操作提供有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation requires precise geometric reasoning, yet existing
visuo-tactile learning methods struggle with sub-millimeter precision tasks
that are routine for traditional model-based approaches. We identify a key
limitation: while tactile sensors provide rich contact information, current
learning frameworks fail to effectively leverage both the perceptual richness
of tactile signals and their spatial relationship with hand kinematics. We
believe an ideal tactile representation should explicitly ground contact
measurements in a stable reference frame while preserving detailed sensory
information, enabling policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also
precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We introduce
SaTA (Spatially-anchored Tactile Awareness for dexterous manipulation), an
end-to-end policy framework that explicitly anchors tactile features to the
hand's kinematic frame through forward kinematics, enabling accurate geometric
reasoning without requiring object models or explicit pose estimation. Our key
insight is that spatially grounded tactile representations allow policies to
not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in
the hand's coordinate system. We validate SaTA on challenging dexterous
manipulation tasks, including bimanual USB-C mating in free space, a task
demanding sub-millimeter alignment precision, as well as light bulb
installation requiring precise thread engagement and rotational control, and
card sliding that demands delicate force modulation and angular precision.
These tasks represent significant challenges for learning-based methods due to
their stringent precision requirements. Across multiple benchmarks, SaTA
significantly outperforms strong visuo-tactile baselines, improving success
rates by up to 30 percentage while reducing task completion times by 27
percentage.

Conclusion: CADRE框架通过接触感知的动态恢复方法，有效解决了灵巧操作中的意外失败问题，具有更好的泛化能力和恢复性能。

Abstract: Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and
disturbances, which can lead to catastrophic failures, such as dropping the
manipulated object. To address this challenge, we focus on the problem of
catching a falling object while it remains within grasping range and,
importantly, resetting the system to a configuration favorable for resuming the
primary manipulation task. We propose Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE), a
reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field
(NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features. Compared to methods
that rely solely on object pose or point cloud input, NDFs can directly reason
about finger-object correspondence and adapt to different object geometries.
Our experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training
efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and ultimately
leads to more successful recoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that CADRE
can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing (ADR) systems have recently achieved champion-level
performance, yet remain highly specific to drone racing. While end-to-end
vision-based methods promise broader applicability, no system to date
simultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and
champion-level performance. In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of
our knowledge, the first end-to-end vision-based ADR policy that maps directly
from pixel-level representations to motor commands. SkyDreamer builds on
informed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world
model decodes to privileged information only available during training. By
extending this concept to end-to-end vision-based ADR, the world model
effectively functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, greatly
improving interpretability. SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid,
resolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from
the world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration,
enabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining.
Real-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight,
executing tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder,
reaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further
demonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on
poor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion
by accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its
flight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to
important aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving
extremely high-speed, agile flight.

TL;DR: 提出基于隐式神经函数的连续时空动态地图表示，用于建模复杂环境中的人类运动模式，无需离散化处理，实现空间和时间的平滑泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂人类环境中实现安全高效的机器人操作需要良好的特定场景运动模式模型，现有动态地图方法存在离散空间采样和昂贵离线构建的问题。

Method: 使用隐式神经函数直接映射坐标到半包裹高斯混合模型参数，构建连续时空动态地图表示，避免离散化和不均匀采样区域的插值问题。

Result: 在大型真实世界人员跟踪数据集上的评估显示，该方法在运动表示精度和稀疏区域速度分布平滑性方面优于基线方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为建模复杂人类运动模式提供了一种强大而高效的方式，能够实现空间和时间的平滑泛化。

Abstract: Safe and efficient robot operation in complex human environments can benefit
from good models of site-specific motion patterns. Maps of Dynamics (MoDs)
provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but
existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require
costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD
representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates
to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the
need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling
smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on a large public
dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, our method achieves
better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in
sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to
available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and
efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RL-100是一个基于扩散视觉运动策略的三阶段强化学习框架，通过模仿学习、离线强化学习和在线强化学习实现机器人操作的100%成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器人操作需要接近或超越熟练人类操作员的可靠性、效率和鲁棒性。

Method: 三阶段管道：1) 模仿学习利用人类先验；2) 迭代离线强化学习使用离线策略评估(OPE)来门控PPO风格更新；3) 在线强化学习消除残余故障模式。额外使用一致性蒸馏头将多步采样压缩为单步策略。

Result: 在7个真实机器人任务中实现100%成功率（900/900次试验），包括一个任务的250/250连续试验。达到接近人类遥操作或更好的时间效率，并展示多小时鲁棒性（最长2小时不间断操作）。

Conclusion: RL-100框架在任务、体现形式和表示方面具有通用性，支持多种输入和机器人平台，实现了极高的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability,
efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We
present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on
diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces
a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors.
Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy
Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are
applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement.
Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An
additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step
sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling
high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while
preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and
representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a
variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We
evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control,
such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth
folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100
attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900
episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The
method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and
demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to
two hours.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: STITCHER是一种无优化的实时轨迹规划框架，通过缝合短轨迹段和图形搜索来生成长距离、表达性强且接近最优的轨迹，解决了优化方法在安全关键场景中的计算时间和数值稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中实现高速自主导航需要实时生成动态可行、无碰撞且满足状态或执行器约束的敏捷轨迹。基于数值优化的现代轨迹规划技术虽然能计算高质量轨迹，但在计算时间和数值稳定性方面存在限制，影响其在安全关键场景中的应用。

Method: 提出STITCHER框架，通过缝合短轨迹段并结合图形搜索来构建长距离轨迹，采用创新的规划架构和算法改进实现实时规划，能够处理非凸约束（如倾斜角限制和电机力限制）。

Result: 仿真测试显示，STITCHER能在几毫秒内为跨越两个50m×50m环境的路径创建安全轨迹。硬件测试验证了其能实时生成可跟踪路径，并成功处理优化方法难以包含的非凸约束。

Conclusion: STITCHER框架在实时性、轨迹质量和约束处理能力方面优于现代优化规划器，为高速自主导航提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires
real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible,
collision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Modern trajectory
planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the
systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy
various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and
the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based
planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free
planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments
together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal
trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based
planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic
developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation
testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up
STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art
optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be
created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m
x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that
STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex
constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise
hard to include in optimization-based planners.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLA^2是一个新型的代理框架，通过结合外部模块（如网络检索和目标检测）来增强视觉-语言-动作模型的泛化能力，特别是在处理训练数据中未见过的物体概念时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在处理训练数据之外的物体概念（如未见过的物体描述和纹理）时成功率显著下降，需要解决这种分布外泛化问题。

Method: 利用OpenVLA作为执行骨干，结合网络检索和目标检测等外部模块，为目标物体提供视觉和文本知识。

Result: 在设计的困难级别泛化基准测试中，VLA^2比当前最先进模型表现更好，相比独立OpenVLA基线，在困难级别基准测试中成功率提高了44.2%，在所有定制环境中平均提高了20.2%，且在域内任务上无性能下降。

Conclusion: VLA^2框架通过有效利用外部知识模块，显著提升了VLA模型在处理分布外物体时的泛化能力。

Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models, pre-trained on large-scale
robotic data, exhibit strong multi-task capabilities and generalize well to
variations in visual and language instructions for manipulation. However, their
success rate drops significantly when faced with object concepts outside the
training data, such as unseen object descriptions and textures in the dataset.
To address this, we propose a novel agentic framework, VLA^2, which leverages
OpenVLA as the execution backbone and effectively leverages external modules
such as web retrieval and object detection to provide visual and textual
knowledge about target objects to the VLA. This approach mitigates
generalization failure when handling out-of-distribution objects. Based on the
LIBERO simulation environment, we introduced novel objects and object
descriptions to construct a new evaluation benchmark with three difficulty
levels to test the effectiveness of our method. Our framework successfully
outperformed the current state-of-the-art models on our designed hard-level
generalization benchmark. Compared to the standalone OpenVLA baseline, VLA^2
achieves a 44.2% improvement in the success rate in the hard-level benchmark
and an average improvement of 20.2% in all customized environments without any
performance degradation on in-domain tasks. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够通过丰富的触觉反馈适应双手机器人装配任务，但仅通过行为克隆难以在机器人中复现这种能力，因为人类演示存在次优性和有限多样性问题。

Method: 首先在少量演示数据上使用扩散策略训练视觉触觉策略，然后将其转移到配备模拟触觉传感器的数字孪生环境中，通过大规模强化学习进行精炼以增强鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，VT-Refine通过增加数据多样性和实现更有效的策略微调，提高了模拟和真实世界中的装配性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了精确接触丰富的双手机器人装配问题，展示了结合真实演示、模拟和强化学习的有效性。

Abstract: Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback
-- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through
behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of
human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile
policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations,
high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise,
contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a
small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This
policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated
tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to
enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer,
we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal
force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using
GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves
assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data
diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning. Our project page is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboGhost是一个免重定向的人形机器人框架，直接基于语言引导的运动潜在空间来条件化策略，绕过了传统的运动解码和重定向步骤，实现了从语言到动作的直接映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言引导的人形机器人运动流程繁琐且不可靠，多阶段处理容易产生累积误差、高延迟，语义与控制之间耦合弱，需要更直接的从语言到动作的路径。

Method: 采用基于扩散的策略，直接从噪声中解噪可执行动作，保留语义意图；使用混合因果Transformer-扩散运动生成器确保长期一致性，同时保持稳定性和多样性。

Result: 实验表明RoboGhost显著降低了部署延迟，提高了成功率和跟踪精度，在真人形机器人上产生平滑、语义对齐的运动。

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉-语言-动作人形系统提供了通用基础，可自然扩展到图像、音频、音乐等其他模态。

Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing
language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable.
They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then
track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is
prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling
between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway
from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.
Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly
conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing
explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based
policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic
intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal
transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency
while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations
for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost
substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking
accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real
humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities
such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for
vision-language-action humanoid systems.

TL;DR: 评估三种语言-音频联合嵌入模型（MS-CLAP、LAION-CLAP、MuQ-MuLan）在捕捉音色感知维度方面的表现，发现LAION-CLAP在乐器声音和音频效果方面与人类感知的音色语义最一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态嵌入模型在语言和音频对齐方面表现出色，但它们与人类对音色（如亮度、粗糙度、温暖度等多方面属性）感知的对应关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 评估MS-CLAP、LAION-CLAP和MuQ-MuLan这三种联合语言-音频嵌入模型捕捉音色感知维度的能力。

Result: LAION-CLAP在乐器声音和音频效果方面始终提供与人类感知音色语义最可靠的对齐。

Conclusion: LAION-CLAP模型在捕捉音色感知维度方面表现最佳，为语言-音频对齐任务提供了更符合人类感知的嵌入空间。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling the relationship between language and sound is
critical for applications such as music information retrieval,text-guided music
generation, and audio captioning. Central to these tasks is the use of joint
language-audio embedding spaces, which map textual descriptions and auditory
content into a shared embedding space. While multimodal embedding models such
as MS-CLAP, LAION-CLAP, and MuQ-MuLan have shown strong performance in aligning
language and audio, their correspondence to human perception of timbre, a
multifaceted attribute encompassing qualities such as brightness, roughness,
and warmth, remains underexplored. In this paper, we evaluate the above three
joint language-audio embedding models on their ability to capture perceptual
dimensions of timbre. Our findings show that LAION-CLAP consistently provides
the most reliable alignment with human-perceived timbre semantics across both
instrumental sounds and audio effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有节拍跟踪模型输出帧级激活，但可以将节拍和强拍建模为时间"对象"，借鉴计算机视觉中的对象检测方法

Method: 将FCOS检测器从计算机视觉适配到1D音频，替换原始骨干网络为WaveBeat的时间特征提取器，添加特征金字塔网络捕获多尺度时间模式，使用NMS选择最终预测

Result: 在标准音乐数据集上评估，取得了竞争性的结果

Conclusion: 对象检测技术只需最小适配就能有效建模音乐节拍

Abstract: Recent beat and downbeat tracking models (e.g., RNNs, TCNs, Transformers)
output frame-level activations. We propose reframing this task as object
detection, where beats and downbeats are modeled as temporal "objects."
Adapting the FCOS detector from computer vision to 1D audio, we replace its
original backbone with WaveBeat's temporal feature extractor and add a Feature
Pyramid Network to capture multi-scale temporal patterns. The model predicts
overlapping beat/downbeat intervals with confidence scores, followed by
non-maximum suppression (NMS) to select final predictions. This NMS step serves
a similar role to DBNs in traditional trackers, but is simpler and less
heuristic. Evaluated on standard music datasets, our approach achieves
competitive results, showing that object detection techniques can effectively
model musical beats with minimal adaptation.

Abstract: The convergence of IoT sensing, edge computing, and machine learning is
transforming precision livestock farming. Yet bioacoustic data streams remain
underused because of computational complexity and ecological validity
challenges. We present one of the most comprehensive bovine vocalization
datasets to date, with 569 curated clips covering 48 behavioral classes,
recorded across three commercial dairy farms using multiple microphone arrays
and expanded to 2900 samples through domain informed augmentation. This FAIR
compliant resource addresses major Big Data challenges - volume (90 hours of
recordings, 65.6 GB), variety (multi farm and multi zone acoustics), velocity
(real time processing), and veracity (noise robust feature extraction). Our
distributed processing framework integrates advanced denoising using iZotope
RX, multimodal synchronization through audio and video alignment, and
standardized feature engineering with 24 acoustic descriptors generated from
Praat, librosa, and openSMILE. Preliminary benchmarks reveal distinct class
level acoustic patterns for estrus detection, distress classification, and
maternal communication. The datasets ecological realism, reflecting authentic
barn acoustics rather than controlled settings, ensures readiness for field
deployment. This work establishes a foundation for animal centered AI, where
bioacoustic data enable continuous and non invasive welfare assessment at
industrial scale. By releasing standardized pipelines and detailed metadata, we
promote reproducible research that connects Big Data analytics, sustainable
agriculture, and precision livestock management. The framework supports UN SDG
9, showing how data science can turn traditional farming into intelligent,
welfare optimized systems that meet global food needs while upholding ethical
animal care.

Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) is rapidly advancing, with broad potential in virtual

remains difficult: human ratings are costly and limited, while existing
objective metrics capture only partial aspects of perceptual quality. To
address this gap, we introduce AudioEval, the first large-scale TTA evaluation
dataset, containing 4,200 audio samples from 24 systems with 126,000 ratings
across five perceptual dimensions, annotated by both experts and non-experts.
Based on this resource, we propose Qwen-DisQA, a multimodal scoring model that

quality ratings. Experiments show its effectiveness in providing reliable and
scalable evaluation. The dataset will be made publicly available to accelerate
future research.

Abstract: Generative speech technologies are progressing rapidly, but evaluating the
perceptual quality of synthetic speech remains a core challenge. Existing

interpretability and generalization across tasks and languages. We present
SpeechLLM-as-Judges, a new paradigm for enabling large language models (LLMs)
to conduct structured and explanation-based speech quality evaluation. To
support this direction, we introduce SpeechEval, a large-scale dataset
containing 32,207 multilingual speech clips and 128,754 annotations spanning
four tasks: quality assessment, pairwise comparison, improvement suggestion,
and deepfake detection. Based on this resource, we develop SQ-LLM, a
speech-quality-aware LLM trained with chain-of-thought reasoning and reward
optimization to improve capability. Experimental results show that SQ-LLM
delivers strong performance across tasks and languages, revealing the potential
of this paradigm for advancing speech quality evaluation. Relevant resources

TL;DR: TASLA是一个文本对齐的语音标记化框架，通过多层动态注意力和有限标量量化解决低帧率下语音细节丢失问题，在2.62Hz帧率下显著改善韵律并保持音质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TASTE框架在文本对齐和低帧率下难以捕捉语音细节的问题，平衡LM友好架构与声学细节保留之间的权衡。

Method: 使用多层动态注意力让每个文本位置自适应混合浅层/深层特征，结合有限标量量化进行离散化处理。

Result: 在2.62Hz帧率下，TASLA在LibriSpeech、EXPRESSO和Voxceleb数据集上持续改善韵律并达到与TASTE竞争的音质。

Conclusion: 动态层混合与频谱通量相关，解释了MLDA如何在极端特征压缩下保持韵律，为低帧率文本对齐语音标记化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Text-Aligned Speech Tokens with Multiple Layer-Aggregation
(TASLA), which is a text-aligned speech tokenization framework that aims to
address the problem that under a low-frame-rate and text-aligned regime,
single-source speech tokens may lose acoustic details during reconstruction. On
the other hand, this paper further explains how different encoder layers
collaborate to capture comprehensive acoustic features for tokenization.
Previous work, TASTE, proposed the text-aligned speech tokenization framework,
which is a LM-friendly architecture, but struggles to capture acoustic details.
We address this trade-off with two components: Multi-Layer Dynamic Attention
(MLDA), which lets each text position adaptively mix shallow/deep features from
a frozen speech encoder, and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), a simple
per-dimension discretization with smooth optimization. At about 2.62 Hz
(tokens/s), TASLA consistently improves prosody and achieves competitive
quality over TASTE on in-domain (LibriSpeech) and OOD (EXPRESSO, Voxceleb)
sets. We further demonstrate that dynamic layer mixing is correlated with
spectral flux and explains why MLDA preserves prosody under a low frame rate
with extreme feature compression.

Abstract: Delivering groceries or cleaning airports, mobile robots exist in public
spaces. While these examples showcase robots that execute tasks, this paper
explores mobile robots that encourage posthuman collaboration rather than
managing environments independently. With feigned fragility, cuteness and
incomplete functionalities, the so-called "weak robots" invite passersby to
engage not only on a utilitarian level, but also through imaginative and
emotional responses. After examining the workings of "weak robots" by queering
notions of function and ability, we introduce two speculative design fiction
vignettes that describe choreographies of such robots in future urban spaces --
one exploring a utopian weak robot and the other a dystopian weak robot. We
introduce these speculations in order to discuss how different values may drive
design decisions, and how such decisions may shape and drive different
socio-technical futures in which robots and humans share public spaces that
incentivise collaboration.

comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT,
suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large
language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant
limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more
advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot
replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its
potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could
offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in
resource-constrained contexts.

TL;DR: MindBenchAI是一个综合性在线平台，用于评估基于大语言模型的心理健康工具，提供客观透明的评估标准，涵盖技术特征、隐私保护和临床推理能力等方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个人越来越多地使用基于大语言模型的工具替代人类专家进行心理健康指导和危机支持，但缺乏足够的实证证据表明AI技术可以临床替代，因此迫切需要评估和监管此类工具。

Method: 基于MINDapps.org框架扩展，开发MindBenchAI平台，通过与国家精神疾病联盟合作，采用基准测试方法系统评估大语言模型及其工具，评估内容包括技术特征、隐私保护、对话风格和临床推理技能。

Result: 创建了一个动态在线资源平台，为不同利益相关者（患者、临床医生、开发者、监管者等）提供易于访问和解释的信息，简化大语言模型及其工具的评估过程。

Conclusion: MindBenchAI平台为解决大语言模型在心理健康领域应用的评估和监管需求提供了一个系统化解决方案，有助于促进AI技术在心理健康领域的负责任部署。

Abstract: Individuals are increasingly utilizing large language model (LLM)based tools
for mental health guidance and crisis support in place of human experts. While
AI technology has great potential to improve health outcomes, insufficient
empirical evidence exists to suggest that AI technology can be deployed as a
clinical replacement; thus, there is an urgent need to assess and regulate such
tools. Regulatory efforts have been made and multiple evaluation frameworks
have been proposed, however,field-wide assessment metrics have yet to be
formally integrated. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive online
platform that aggregates evaluation approaches and serves as a dynamic online
resource to simplify LLM and LLM-based tool assessment: MindBenchAI. At its
core, MindBenchAI is designed to provide easily accessible/interpretable
information for diverse stakeholders (patients, clinicians, developers,
regulators, etc.). To create MindBenchAI, we built off our work developing
MINDapps.org to support informed decision-making around smartphone app use for
mental health, and expanded the technical MINDapps.org framework to encompass
novel large language model (LLM) functionalities through benchmarking
approaches. The MindBenchAI platform is designed as a partnership with the
National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) to provide assessment tools that
systematically evaluate LLMs and LLM-based tools with objective and transparent
criteria from a healthcare standpoint, assessing both profile (i.e. technical
features, privacy protections, and conversational style) and performance
characteristics (i.e. clinical reasoning skills).

Motivation: 为老年群体设计严肃游戏，促进有意义的互动，并开发一个全面的框架来构建有目的性的严肃游戏设计。

Method: 创建Puzzlegram游戏原型，利用音乐作为关键组件建立游戏设计，强调记忆、听觉互动和触觉反馈，通过熟悉的过去音乐提供有意义的情境化。

Result: 成功开发了Puzzlegram严肃游戏原型，为老年群体提供了结合音乐、记忆和感官互动的游戏体验。

Conclusion: 严肃游戏设计需要促进有意义的互动，未来可能通过整合人工智能来适应不同的认知功能状态，实现个性化监控。

Abstract: An original serious game prototype named 'Puzzlegram' is created for the
elderly demographic in group settings as the target players. Puzzlegram is
precisely designed to accentuate memory, auditory interaction as well as haptic
response to visual signals with the use of music. Music is introduced as a key
component for establishing the game design that provides a source of meaningful
contextualization (familiar music from the past) for setting the game
mechanics, which facilitated the construction of the serious game design
process. The discussion topics raised include the need to design serious games
for fostering meaningful interactions, as well as developing a thorough
framework for constructing purposeful design for serious games. A potential
integral of artificial intelligence to Puzzlegram may involve assigning a novel
dimension to its existing problem solving task by adapting to varying states of
cognitive function for monitoring purposes based on an individual's interaction
with the game.

TL;DR: 本研究将可解释AI(XAI)的计算工具应用于分析人类学习过程，通过构建粒子加速器操作员子任务图，揭示了人类如何将复杂问题分解为简单组件以及问题解决结构如何随专业知识演变。


<details>

Motivation: 连接心理学和可解释AI领域，利用XAI的计算工具来定量研究人类认知过程，特别是在安全可靠性关键领域中的学习行为。

Method: 通过构建操作员子任务图，应用社区检测和层次聚类等技术分析档案操作员数据，模拟人类在调整粒子加速器这一复杂现实任务中的行为。

Result: 揭示了操作员如何将问题分解为更简单的组件，以及这些解决问题的结构如何随着专业知识的增长而演变。

Conclusion: 阐明了人类在没有全局最优解的情况下如何发展高效策略，并证明了基于XAI的方法在定量研究人类认知方面的实用性。

Abstract: Both humans and machine learning models learn from experience, particularly
in safety- and reliability-critical domains. While psychology seeks to
understand human cognition, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) develops methods
to interpret machine learning models. This study bridges these domains by
applying computational tools from XAI to analyze human learning. We modeled
human behavior during a complex real-world task -- tuning a particle
accelerator -- by constructing graphs of operator subtasks. Applying techniques
such as community detection and hierarchical clustering to archival operator
data, we reveal how operators decompose the problem into simpler components and
how these problem-solving structures evolve with expertise. Our findings
illuminate how humans develop efficient strategies in the absence of globally
optimal solutions, and demonstrate the utility of XAI-based methods for
quantitatively studying human cognition.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了紧急庇护所前线工作人员面临的职业挑战，并提出了一种支持人道决策的数据导航界面设计方法，而非自动化决策系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前线工作人员面临替代性创伤、同情疲劳和职业倦怠，现有技术往往不符合他们的独特需求，反而增加了工作负担。现有文献主要关注自动化决策，但本文关注工作人员可能抵制这种自动化的场景。

Method: 2022-2024年在加拿大大型紧急庇护所进行的定性实地研究，通过共同设计、开发和部署交互式数据导航界面来支持高风险决策。

Result: 研究发现工作人员对将弱势群体决策外包给数据系统存在明显抵触，提出了数据外包连续体的概念。

Conclusion: 设计师应创建支持非营利领域中富有同情心的数据驱动决策的技术，而非完全自动化决策过程。

Abstract: Frontline staff of emergency shelters face challenges such as vicarious
trauma, compassion fatigue, and burnout. The technology they use is often not
designed for their unique needs, and can feel burdensome on top of their
already cognitively and emotionally taxing work. While existing literature
focuses on data-driven technologies that automate or streamline frontline
decision-making about vulnerable individuals, we discuss scenarios in which
staff may resist such automation. We then suggest how data-driven technologies
can better align with their human-centred decision-making processes. This paper
presents findings from a qualitative fieldwork study conducted from 2022 to
2024 at a large emergency shelter in Canada. The goal of this fieldwork was to
co-design, develop, and deploy an interactive data-navigation interface that
supports frontline staff when making collaborative, high-stakes decisions about
individuals experiencing homelessness. By reflecting on this fieldwork, we
contribute insight into the role that administrative shelter data play during
decision-making, and unpack staff members' apparent reluctance to outsource
decisions about vulnerable individuals to data systems. Our findings suggest a
data-outsourcing continuum, which we discuss in terms of how designers may
create technologies to support compassionate, data-driven decision-making in
nonprofit domains.

TL;DR: VisAider是一个AI辅助的交互式数据展示原型系统，通过实时分析展示上下文来生成可视化辅助建议，解决传统可视化系统在实时小组互动中适应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式可视化系统依赖固定的用户操作与可视化命令映射，无法在实时演示中灵活改变可视化类型、调整数据转换或动态添加数据集，限制了在动态讨论环境中的适应性。

Method: 基于对经验数据分析师的调研，开发VisAider原型系统，该系统持续分析实时展示上下文（包括可用数据集、活动可视化、对话内容和受众特征），生成相关可视化辅助的排名建议。

Result: 原型系统在模拟场景中验证了方法的可行性，初步测试揭示了在推断适当数据转换、解决模糊可视化任务和实现低延迟响应方面的挑战。

Conclusion: 正在进行的工作旨在解决这些限制，将系统集成到展示环境中，并准备进行总结性用户研究以评估可用性和沟通效果。

Abstract: Effective real-time data presentation is essential in small-group interactive
contexts, where discussions evolve dynamically and presenters must adapt
visualizations to shifting audience interests. However, most existing
interactive visualization systems rely on fixed mappings between user actions
and visualization commands, limiting their ability to support richer operations
such as changing visualization types, adjusting data transformations, or
incorporating additional datasets on the fly during live presentations. This
work-in-progress paper presents VisAider, an AI-assisted interactive data
presentation prototype that continuously analyzes the live presentation
context, including the available dataset, active visualization, ongoing
conversation, and audience profile, to generate ranked suggestions for relevant
visualization aids. Grounded in a formative study with experienced data
analysts, we identified key challenges in adapting visual content in real time
and distilled design considerations to guide system development. A prototype
implementation demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in simulated
scenarios, and preliminary testing highlights challenges in inferring
appropriate data transformations, resolving ambiguous visualization tasks, and
achieving low-latency responsiveness. Ongoing work focuses on addressing these
limitations, integrating the system into presentation environments, and
preparing a summative user study to evaluate usability and communicative
impact.

TL;DR: TapNav是一个自适应空间触觉屏幕阅读器原型，通过触觉覆盖层和自适应听觉反馈，帮助盲人和低视力用户在触摸屏上进行空间导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的音频屏幕阅读器受限于顺序音频的信息带宽，无法有效传达空间信息，限制了BLV用户与触摸屏设备的交互效率。

Method: 开发TapNav原型，结合触觉覆盖层和自适应听觉反馈，在12名BLV用户中评估其在数据可视化和银行交易应用中的使用效果。

Result: 定性研究发现，触摸点和空间约束导航帮助用户更快地预测结果，并将认知负荷转移到触觉上。

Conclusion: 提出了为自适应空间触觉屏幕阅读器创建触觉覆盖层的设计指南，并讨论了其在数据分析和日常应用导航场景中的通用性。

Abstract: Screen readers are audio-based software that Blind and Low Vision (BLV)
people use to interact with computing devices, such as tablets and smartphones.
Although this technology has significantly improved the accessibility of
touchscreen devices, the sequential nature of audio limits the bandwidth of
information users can receive and process. We introduce TapNav, an adaptive
spatiotactile screen reader prototype developed to interact with touchscreen
interfaces spatially. TapNav's screen reader provides adaptive auditory
feedback that, in combination with a tactile overlay, conveys spatial
information and location of interface elements on-screen. We evaluated TapNav
with 12 BLV users who interacted with TapNav to explore a data visualization
and interact with a bank transactions application. Our qualitative findings
show that touch points and spatially constrained navigation helped users
anticipate outcomes for faster exploration, and offload cognitive load to
touch. We provide design guidelines for creating tactile overlays for adaptive
spatiotactile screen readers and discuss their generalizability beyond our
exploratory data analysis and everyday application navigation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从AI代理的成功和失败尝试中自动合成可重用工作流的方法，通过执行守卫帮助代理检测和修复错误，显著提高了重复任务的完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的网络代理在执行重复任务时难以可靠运行，需要用户每次提供详细指导，限制了自动化效率。

Method: 从代理的成功和失败尝试中自动合成可重用工作流，并加入执行守卫机制来检测和修复错误。

Result: 在15个任务中将成功完成率从24.2%提升到70.1%，用户测试显示比两种基线方法具有更高的成功率和更少的指导需求。

Conclusion: 该方法使代理能够以最小干预完成同类型重复任务，同时允许用户轻松监控代理行为和理解失败原因。

Abstract: AI-powered web agents have the potential to automate repetitive tasks, such
as form filling, information retrieval, and scheduling, but they struggle to
reliably execute these tasks without human intervention, requiring users to
provide detailed guidance during every run. We address this limitation by
automatically synthesizing reusable workflows from an agent's successful and
failed attempts. These workflows incorporate execution guards that help agents
detect and fix errors while keeping users informed of progress and issues. Our
approach enables agents to successfully complete repetitive tasks of the same
type with minimal intervention, increasing the success rates from 24.2% to
70.1% across fifteen tasks. To evaluate this approach, we invited nine users
and found that our agent helped them complete web tasks with a higher success
rate and less guidance compared to two baseline methods, as well as allowed
users to easily monitor agent behavior and understand failures.

Motivation: 人们在数字设备上工作时经常面临分心问题，导致生产力下降和负面心理影响，需要一种智能方法来帮助用户保持专注。

Method: 利用大型语言模型分析屏幕截图、应用标题和URL，通过初始澄清对话和持续用户反馈提高检测准确性，当行为偏离目标时发出通知。

Result: 在三周22名参与者的实地部署中，与基于规则的意图提醒系统和被动基线相比，AI助手能有效帮助用户保持专注并使数字行为与意图保持一致。

Conclusion: AI助手能够有效支持用户维持专注度并使其数字行为与意图保持一致，系统源代码已公开。

Abstract: When working on digital devices, people often face distractions that can lead
to a decline in productivity and efficiency, as well as negative psychological
and emotional impacts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant that elicits a user's intention,
assesses whether ongoing activities are in line with that intention, and
provides gentle nudges when deviations occur. The system leverages a large
language model to analyze screenshots, application titles, and URLs, issuing
notifications when behavior diverges from the stated goal. Its detection
accuracy is refined through initial clarification dialogues and continuous user
feedback. In a three-week, within-subjects field deployment with 22
participants, we compared our assistant to both a rule-based intent reminder
system and a passive baseline that only logged activity. Results indicate that
our AI assistant effectively supports users in maintaining focus and aligning
their digital behavior with their intentions. Our source code is publicly

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过观察用户行为自动推断即时目标的方法，然后基于这些目标优化LLM输出，从而生成更符合用户需求的工具和响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型具有广泛功能，但在没有明确目标时往往产生平庸结果。通过推断用户的即时目标并针对该目标进行优化，可以使LLM输出更加响应和符合需求。

Method: 提出了一种架构，通过被动观察用户行为自动诱导即时目标，然后引导下游AI系统基于这些目标进行生成和评估。

Result: 在实验中，基于JIT目标的LLM输出相比典型LLM获得了66-86%的胜率，现场使用会话确认了JIT目标能为每个参与者生成独特的专用工具。

Conclusion: 诱导即时目标的方法能够显著提升LLM输出的质量和针对性，生成更符合用户需求的专用工具和响应。

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a
specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails
littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment
objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to
produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired.
We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time
objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI
systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing
just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution")
enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based
on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or
surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on
participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86%
win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT
objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.

Motivation: 研究增强现实技术作为神经发育障碍人群治疗工具的潜力，探索如何通过沉浸式体验帮助患者发展生活技能和认知能力。

Method: 通过两个探索性研究评估Holomarket和ATOF应用。Holomarket让参与者与增强食品物品和智能收银机交互，模拟超市购物；ATOF让参与者使用海豚形状智能对象在海洋环境中完成任务。

Result: 参与者喜欢逼真的环境和有形交互，但存在操作虚拟物体困难和长时间使用头显不适等问题。ATOF的沉浸体验和可定制任务受到好评。两个应用都显示出作为治疗工具的潜力。

Conclusion: 增强现实技术有望成为神经发育障碍人群的重要治疗干预工具，但需要进一步研究改进应用交互性和用户舒适度。

Abstract: Tangible Augmented Reality (TAR) is an interaction paradigm that integrates
physical and digital worlds to create immersive, interactive experiences. This
paper explores two TAR applications, Holomarket and Along the Oceanic Flow
(ATOF), and presents insights from two exploratory studies evaluating their
usability and likeability among individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders
(NDD). Holomarket is designed to simulate a supermarket shopping experience,
helping users develop essential life skills such as item selection, basic
arithmetic, and money handling. Participants interacted with augmented food
items and a smart cash register, navigating a virtual supermarket environment.
While participants enjoyed the realistic setting and tangible interactions,
some usability challenges, such as difficulty manipulating virtual objects and
discomfort with prolonged headset use, were noted. ATOF transforms the user
environment into an oceanic world, where participants use a dolphin-shaped
smart object to complete tasks like collecting items and solving puzzles. This
application aims to improve motor coordination and cognitive skills.
Participants appreciated the immersive experience, the customizable tasks, and
the tangible dolphin interface. However, some faced difficulties interacting
with specific virtual elements. Overall, both applications demonstrated
potential as therapeutic tools for NDD, offering engaging and immersive
experiences. Despite some usability challenges and hardware limitations, the
positive feedback suggests that TAR could play a crucial role in future
therapeutic interventions. Further research is needed to refine these
applications and enhance user interaction and comfort.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of virtual reality (VR) for enhancing
sales skills training using a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). VR
technology enables users to practice interpersonal and negotiation skills in
controlled, immersive environments that mimic real-world scenarios. In this
study, participants engaged in sales simulations set in a virtual dealership,
interacting with avatars in different work settings and with various
communication styles. The research employed a within-subjects experimental
design involving 20 university students. Each participant experienced four
distinct sales scenarios randomized for environmental and customer conditions.
Training effectiveness was assessed using validated metrics alongside custom
experience questions. Findings revealed consistent user experience and presence
across all scenarios, with no significant differences detected based on
communication styles or environmental conditions. The study highlights the
advantages of semi-immersive VR systems for collaborative learning, peer
feedback, and realistic training environments. However, further research is
recommended to refine VR designs, improve engagement, and maximize skills
transfer to real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了非对称多人VR游戏中不同设计方法对玩家体验的影响，通过测试四种不同版本（共享/分离虚拟环境、相互/单向依赖）发现游戏设计变化会影响系统可用性、用户体验质量、沉浸控制和内在动机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR技术因其沉浸性可能导致用户与现实世界隔离，虽然已有非对称多人选项来促进社交互动，但相关研究有限，需要探索不同游戏设计方法如何影响玩家体验。

Method: 创建了四种版本的VR体验，涉及74名参与者进行测试，版本差异包括虚拟环境共享程度（共享vs分离）和玩家依赖关系（相互vs单向）。

Result: 游戏设计变化显著影响玩家体验的多个方面，包括系统可用性、实用用户体验质量、沉浸控制和内在动机。玩家角色和虚拟环境中的共同存在不会同时影响这些方面，表明玩家之间的依赖程度会改变体验。

Conclusion: 非对称多人VR游戏的设计选择对玩家体验有重要影响，玩家之间的依赖关系是改变体验的关键因素，这为VR游戏设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The risk of isolation in virtual reality (VR) stems from the immersive nature
of the technology. VR can transport users to entirely virtual environments,
often disconnecting them from the physical world and real-life interactions.
Asymmetric multiplayer options have been explored to address this issue and
encourage social interaction by requiring players to communicate and
collaborate to achieve common objectives. Nevertheless, research on
implementing these designs and their effects is limited, mainly due to the
novelty of multiplayer VR gaming. This article investigates how different game
design approaches affect the player experience during an asymmetric multiplayer
VR game. Four versions of a VR experience were created and tested in a study
involving 74 participants. Each version differs in terms of the sharing of
virtual environments (shared vs separated) and the players' dependency on the
experience (mutual vs unidirectional). The results showed that variations in
game design influenced aspects of the player experience, such as system
usability, pragmatic UX quality, immersion control, and intrinsic motivation.
Notably, the player roles and the co-presence in the virtual environment did
not simultaneously impact these aspects, suggesting that the degree to which
players depend on each other changes the player experience.

Motivation: 探索主动推理作为HCI中空间指向任务的用户计算模型，替代传统的基于最优反馈控制的模型，实现更自然的延迟补偿和目标难度适应。

Method: 构建具有连续状态、动作和观察空间的主动推理代理，使用简单动态系统建模鼠标光标动态，包含真实的感知延迟，通过最小化期望自由能量选择动作。

Result: 代理生成了合理的指向运动和点击行为，终点方差与人类用户相似，能够适应不同目标难度而无需重新调整系统参数。

Conclusion: 主动推理为空间指向任务提供了可行的计算模型，但配置与连续系统交互的主动推理代理仍面临挑战。

Abstract: We explore the use of Active Inference (AIF) as a computational user model
for spatial pointing, a key problem in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). We
present an AIF agent with continuous state, action, and observation spaces,
performing one-dimensional mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple
underlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic
perceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based
models, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy,
solely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing
clicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible
pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar
end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we
incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent.
The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without
the need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches. We discuss
the simulation results and emphasize the challenges in identifying the correct
configuration of an AIF agent interacting with continuous systems.

Self-regulation, understood as combining autonomy with positive outcomes, is
key to this distinction. We argue that audio, often overlooked, plays a central
role in regulation. It can modulate arousal, mark transitions, and provide
closure, yet its contribution to well-being remains underexplored. This paper
identifies methodological and accessibility gaps that limit recognition of
audio's potential and outlines ways to address them. We aim to encourage
researchers and developers to integrate audio more deliberately into the design
and study of healthier escapist play.

TL;DR: 本文研究了盲人和低视力用户在自动驾驶车辆出行过程中的信息需求，通过调查和访谈揭示了用户在导航、上车、下车三个关键阶段的信息优先级和呈现方式偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆有望为盲人和低视力用户提供更大的独立出行能力，但需要了解他们在整个出行过程中的具体信息需求，以便设计合适的自然语言交互系统。

Method: 采用问卷调查（202名BLV受访者）和深度访谈（12名BLV个体）相结合的方法，调查了用户在寻找车辆、导航、上车和下车三个阶段的信息需求。

Result: 研究发现BLV用户在导航阶段最关注车辆品牌型号和如何找到正确车辆；上车时需要确认目的地和安全功能；下车时重视障碍物信息和出口位置信息。用户偏好使用自己的智能手机设备接收信息，并倾向于音频交互方式。

Conclusion: 本研究为向BLV用户提供出行相关信息提供了结构化框架，有助于设计针对每个出行阶段定制的自然语言描述，最终提升BLV个体的出行能力和独立性。

Abstract: Purpose: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming a promising transportation
solution for blind and low-vision (BLV) travelers, offering the potential for
greater independent mobility. This paper explores the information needs of BLV
users across multiple steps of the transportation journey, including finding
and navigating to, entering, and exiting vehicles independently.
  Methods: A survey with 202 BLV respondents and interviews with 12 BLV
individuals revealed the perspectives of BLV end-users and informed the
sequencing of natural language information required for successful travel.
Whereas the survey identified key information needs across the three trip
segments, the interviews helped prioritize how that information should be
presented in a sequence of accessible descriptions to travelers.
  Results: Taken together, the survey and interviews reveal that BLV users
prioritize knowing the vehicle's make and model and how to find the correct
vehicle during the navigation phase. They also emphasize the importance of
confirmations about the vehicle's destination and onboard safety features upon
entering the vehicle. While exiting, BLV users value information about hazards
and obstacles, as well as knowing which side of the vehicle to exit.
Furthermore, results highlight that BLV travelers desire using their own
smartphone devices when receiving information from AVs and prefer audio-based
interaction.
  Conclusion: The findings from this research contribute a structured framework
for delivering trip-related information to BLV users, useful for designers
incorporating natural language descriptions tailored to each travel segment.
This work offers important contributions for sequencing transportation-related
descriptions throughout the AV journey, ultimately enhancing the mobility and
independence of BLV individuals.

kit examples provide a guideline that inspires and informs future research and
development of novel paper robot-building kits.

Abstract: This survey paper presents a comprehensive examination of Spiking Neural
Network (SNN) architecture search (SNNaS) from a unique hardware/software
co-design perspective. SNNs, inspired by biological neurons, have emerged as a
promising approach to neuromorphic computing. They offer significant advantages
in terms of power efficiency and real-time resource-constrained processing,
making them ideal for edge computing and IoT applications. However, designing
optimal SNN architectures poses significant challenges, due to their inherent
complexity (e.g., with respect to training) and the interplay between hardware
constraints and SNN models. We begin by providing an overview of SNNs,
emphasizing their operational principles and key distinctions from traditional
artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then provide a brief overview of the
state of the art in NAS for ANNs, highlighting the challenges of directly
applying these approaches to SNNs. We then survey the state-of-the-art in
SNN-specific NAS approaches. Finally, we conclude with insights into future
research directions for SNN research, emphasizing the potential of
hardware/software co-design in unlocking the full capabilities of SNNs. This
survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了决策导向技术(DOTechnique)，一种基于决策一致性而非输出相似性的模型有效性验证方法，通过评估代理模型是否与高保真模型产生等效决策来确定模型有效性区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义的有效性框架，但这些框架可能不可用或不充分。模型有效性对决策过程至关重要，需要更有效的验证方法。

Method: DOTechnique方法通过决策一致性评估模型有效性，整合领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间，提高计算效率。

Result: 在高速公路变道系统案例中，DOTechnique成功揭示了仿真模型的有效性区域，证明了该技术的实用性。

Conclusion: DOTechnique技术能够通过决策者上下文支持发现模型有效性，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

Motivation: 当前最先进的ASR系统主要依赖音频信息而忽略多模态上下文，但视觉信息对于消歧和适应至关重要。本文特别关注在科学演示场景中集成演示文稿幻灯片。

Method: 创建多模态演示基准，包括领域特定术语的自动分析；探索用多模态信息增强语音模型的方法；通过数据增强方法解决幻灯片数据集不足问题；使用增强数据集训练模型。

Result: 相比基线模型，词错误率相对降低了约34%（所有词）和35%（领域特定术语）。

Conclusion: 集成视觉信息（特别是演示文稿幻灯片）能显著提升ASR系统性能，特别是在处理领域特定术语方面。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否像人类一样容易产生因果幻觉，特别是在医学等需要准确因果推理的领域中，这对评估LLMs的真实理解能力具有重要意义。

Method: 构建了1000个医学领域的零关联情境数据集，使用经典的认知科学范式——关联判断任务，让LLMs评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果幻觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，并对其在需要准确因果推理的决策领域中的应用提出警示。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

TL;DR: GammaZero是一个基于动作中心图表示框架的POMDP规划学习方法，能够在问题规模间实现零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要领域特定的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在通过统一的图表示实现跨问题规模的泛化。

Method: 将信念状态转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络和专家演示学习价值函数和策略，然后应用这些启发式来指导蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同规模问题上与BetaZero性能相当，同时能零样本泛化到训练时未见过的2-4倍大规模问题。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示实现了POMDP规划的可扩展性和泛化能力，在保持解质量的同时减少了搜索需求。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

Motivation: 当前多智能体AI系统的通信协议碎片化，存在语义鸿沟，无法进行系统属性的严格分析，存在架构错位和可被利用的协调问题等风险。

Method: 引入两个基础模型：主机智能体模型（负责与用户交互、任务分解和协调执行）和任务生命周期模型（详细描述子任务从创建到完成的状态转换），并定义了17个主机智能体属性和14个任务生命周期属性。

Result: 建立了首个严格基础的、领域无关的框架，用于系统分析、设计和部署正确、可靠、鲁棒的多智能体AI系统。

Conclusion: 该框架为多AI智能体系统的行为推理提供了统一的语义基础，支持形式化验证、协调边缘情况检测以及死锁和安全漏洞的预防。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

Motivation: 现有前沿AI模型监管提案因安全与创新的权衡而被搁置，需要一种既能确保AI安全又能积极促进创新的监管方法。

Method: 强制要求大型AI实验室发布小型、开放访问的类比模型，这些模型作为公共代理，允许广泛参与安全验证、可解释性研究和算法透明度工作，而无需披露全规模模型。

Conclusion: 这种监管方法不仅应该被采纳，而且说明了一个更广泛的原则：对模型的深入理解可以缓解安全与创新的权衡，让我们同时获得更多安全性和创新性。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架为共识声明生成提供了可证明的公平性保证，将社会选择理论原则成功应用于文本生成任务

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境压力与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 改进PerceiverIO架构，采用简化编码器（64D潜在空间）防止小数据集过拟合，并使用自适应Barlow Twins损失促进模态互补性而非冗余。

Result: 模型准确率达76.9%，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比原始PerceiverIO提升25%。消融研究显示传感器单独准确率61.5%，图像单独46.2%，证实多模态协同成功。

Conclusion: 架构简化结合对比正则化可在数据稀缺的文化遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将强化学习与传统行为树结合在商业游戏NPC开发中的可行性，使用AMD Schola插件在虚幻引擎中训练多任务NPC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习研究进展迅速，但在商业游戏中的采用仍然缓慢。论文旨在解决游戏AI社区在实际使用RL驱动NPC时面临的挑战，并探索RL与行为树的结合点。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在虚幻引擎中训练RL智能体，创建多任务NPC，并详细描述了将RL模型与行为树联合训练的方法论。

Result: 展示了在受《最后生还者》启发的复杂3D环境中创建多任务NPC的可行性，验证了RL与行为树结合的实用性。

Conclusion: RL与行为树的交叉点是一个值得进一步探索的关键节点，虽然已有研究提出这种结合，但实际采用仍然罕见，本文证明了这种方法的可行性。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA是一个用于临床订单检索的双编码器系统，能够直接从临床对话中检索规范订单，无需LLM重写，提供实时、稳定的订单触发功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话混合了明确指令和隐含推理，现有系统依赖LLM重写会带来延迟、不稳定和不透明问题，阻碍实时订单处理。

Method: 基于PubMedBERT初始化的双编码器，使用重复安全的对比目标进行微调，通过受限LLM指导将不同意图表达对齐到共享订单概念，支持查询和无查询两种模式。

Result: JEDA在实践中取得显著提升，大幅优于基础编码器和近期开源嵌入模型，提供更快、更可解释的检索层。

Conclusion: JEDA提供了一个快速、可解释、无需LLM的检索层，能够实时将环境上下文链接到可操作的临床订单。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

TL;DR: ARM-FM是一个利用基础模型自动设计强化学习奖励函数的框架，通过奖励机器将自然语言规范转换为结构化奖励函数，实现任务分解和零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数设计高度敏感，这限制了其广泛应用。传统的手动奖励设计需要专业知识且耗时，需要自动化方法来简化这一过程。

Method: 使用基础模型将自然语言规范自动转换为奖励机器，将语言嵌入与奖励机器状态关联以实现任务间泛化，利用奖励机器的结构化形式进行任务分解。

Result: 在多个挑战性环境中验证了ARM-FM的有效性，展示了零样本泛化能力，证明该方法能够自动生成有效的奖励函数。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型和奖励机器，实现了从自然语言到强化学习奖励函数的自动化转换，为简化RL应用提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了在线骚扰代理基准，包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、多代理模拟、三种越狱方法和混合评估框架。研究发现越狱调优使骚扰成功率大幅提升，闭源和开源模型表现出不同的升级轨迹，闭源模型更易受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰往往在多轮交互中展开。需要评估LLM代理在多轮交互中的安全漏洞。

Method: 构建了包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈理论的多代理模拟、针对记忆、规划和微调的三种越狱方法，以及混合评估框架。使用LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemini-2.0-flash进行实验。

Result: 越狱调优使骚扰成功率从57.25-64.19%提升至95.78-96.89%（Llama），从98.46%提升至99.33%（Gemini）。最常见的毒性行为是侮辱（84.9-87.8% vs 44.2-50.8%）和谩骂（81.2-85.1% vs 31.5-38.8%）。闭源模型表现出显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: 多轮和理论基础的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟人类骚扰动态，需要开发强大的安全防护措施来确保在线平台的安全性和责任性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估深度研究系统时存在不足，无法满足用户中心、动态性、明确性和多维度搜索等关键原则，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含100个专家策划任务的LiveResearchBench基准，以及涵盖内容和报告质量的DeepEval评估套件，包含四种互补的评估协议。

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench和DeepEval为系统评估深度研究能力提供了严格基础，识别了现有系统的局限性和未来发展方向。

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Agentic Self-Learning (ASL)框架，通过多角色协同进化的强化学习实现无需人工标注数据的智能体自我学习。研究发现生成式奖励模型和大量任务数据是规模化训练的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不依赖人工标注数据集或预定义规则奖励的情况下，通过自我学习来规模化训练基于LLM的智能体。

Method: 提出ASL框架，统一任务生成、策略执行和评估，通过提示生成器、策略模型和生成式奖励模型形成良性循环。采用多角色强化学习实现闭环自我改进。

Result: ASL实现稳定持续的提升，超越强基线方法，在零标注数据条件下继续改进。生成式奖励模型的验证能力是主要瓶颈，持续训练可缓解奖励黑客问题。

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放领域智能体学习的关键杠杆，多角色协同进化是实现可扩展自我改进智能体的有效方法。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Conclusion: MorphoBench提高了模型推理评估的全面性和有效性，为改进大型模型的推理能力和科学稳健性提供了可靠指导。

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个在微调过程中保护大语言模型安全对齐的框架，通过安全敏感子空间和有害抵抗零空间来防止安全行为退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在微调过程中容易丧失预训练的安全对齐能力，即使使用良性数据或低秩适配也会产生有害响应，需要保护安全机制。

Method: 使用协方差预条件奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和安全无关组件，初始化低秩适配器时冻结安全相关部分；构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的安全输出。

Result: 在多个下游任务中，GuardSpace优于现有方法。对于Llama-2-7B-Chat在GSM8K上的微调，有害评分从14.4%降至3.6%，准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace能有效保护大语言模型在微调过程中的安全对齐，同时保持任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人机交互中的认知和认识论漂移，通过三个维度（地图vs领土、直觉vs理性、冲突vs确认）来识别AI系统的局限性，强调需要将人类理性作为人工智能直觉的治理机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然流畅且情感共鸣强，但基于统计预测而非基础推理，存在幻觉风险。它们体现了系统1认知（快速、联想、有说服力但缺乏反思），需要框架来诊断认知漂移并实现更透明、批判性的人机交互。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维框架：(i)地图vs领土-区分现实表征与现实本身；(ii)直觉vs理性-基于双过程理论区分快速情感判断与慢速反思思维；(iii)冲突vs确认-检验观点是通过批判性测试还是简单相互验证。

Result: Rose-Frame不试图用更多数据或规则修复LLM，而是提供反思工具，使模型局限性和用户假设可见，实现更透明和批判性AI部署。

Conclusion: 将对齐重新定义为认知治理：无论是人类还是人工智能的直觉，都必须由人类理性来治理。只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，才能将机器的流畅性与人类的理解对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

Conclusion: Terrarium框架为研究LLM多智能体系统的安全、隐私和安全性提供了有效的测试平台，有助于构建更可信的多智能体系统。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，通过实时无监督的步骤级错误检测和自我修正来增强多智能体系统的鲁棒性，防止错误级联传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在协作解决问题方面表现出色，但对级联错误很脆弱——单个错误步骤可能在智能体间传播并破坏整个轨迹。

Method: MASC采用两种互补设计：(1) 基于历史的下一个执行重构，从查询和交互历史预测下一步的嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；(2) 原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验，在稀疏上下文下稳定重构和异常评分。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC始终优于所有基线，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；在不同MAS框架中都能带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: 元认知监控和针对性修正能够以最小开销缓解错误传播，为多智能体系统提供了有效的容错机制。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

### [289] [Can MLLMs Absorb Math Reasoning Abilities from LLMs as Free Lunch?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14387)
*Yijie Hu,Zihao Zhou,Kaizhu Huang,Xiaowei Huang,Qiufeng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IP-Merging是一种无需调优的方法，通过识别MLLM和数学LLM中的推理相关参数，将其投影到MLLM子空间进行融合，直接提升多模态大语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的数学推理能力落后于纯文本LLM，但直接使用模型融合方法会因参数空间不对齐而导致性能下降。

Method: 提出IP-Merging方法：1）识别MLLM和数学LLM中的推理相关参数；2）将这些参数投影到MLLM的子空间；3）在子空间内合并参数。

Result: 实验表明IP-Merging能有效提升MLLMs的数学推理能力，且不损害其他能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging提供了一种无需调优的方法，使MLLMs能够直接从现成的数学LLMs中吸收推理能力，解决了参数空间不对齐的问题。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

*Zhe Wu,Hongjin Lu,Junliang Xing,Changhao Zhang,Yin Zhu,Yuhao Yang,Yuheng Jing,Kai Li,Kun Shao,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Yuanchun Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-Agent是一个可训练的分层视觉语言代理，用于移动设备控制，通过高层推理模型和低层动作模型的联合优化，在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的移动设备控制方法大多依赖直接的状态到动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划，导致在新任务或未见UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层架构：高层推理模型和低层动作模型联合优化。将多步决策重新表述为单步子目标序列，并提出前瞻优势函数，利用低层模型的执行反馈指导高层优化，缓解长时任务中的路径爆炸问题。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于提示式方法(17.7%)、监督学习方法(54.5%)和强化学习方法(71.9%)。在ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中表现出竞争力的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent通过分层设计和联合优化策略，在移动设备控制任务中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了在复杂场景下的强适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

*Xikai Zhang,Bo Wang,Likang Xiao,Yongzhi Li,Quan Chen,Wenju Wu,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著超越原始MAS性能，在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%的最终通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务中的局限性，以及多智能体系统存在的高推理成本、长延迟和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，通过端到端训练将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一模型中，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型进行训练。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，训练后的模型达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功将多智能体系统的结构化推理和规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著提升了性能并降低了推理成本。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

*Claudia Grundke,Gabriele Röger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个转换方法，用于消除PDDL公理中派生谓词的负出现，证明这种限制与分层公理集具有相同的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中谓词的负出现只能针对直接由动作设置的谓词，而文献中常偏离此限制仅要求公理集可分层。本文旨在证明这两种变体具有相同的表达能力。

Method: 提出了相应的转换方法，通过消除派生谓词的负出现，将包含负出现的公理转换为符合PDDL标准限制的形式。

Result: 证明了两种公理变体都能表达与最小不动点逻辑完全相同的查询，表明派生谓词的负出现可以被消除。

Conclusion: 通过提出的转换方法，验证了PDDL标准限制与分层公理集在表达能力上的等价性，为PDDL公理的使用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Helmsman是一个多智能体系统，通过模拟研发工作流程自动合成联邦学习系统，包括交互式规划、模块化代码生成和自主评估优化，在AgentFL-Bench基准测试中表现优于手工设计的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习系统设计复杂，需要处理数据异构性和系统约束等多方面挑战，导致解决方案脆弱且定制化，成为关键瓶颈。

Method: 采用三阶段协作方法：1) 交互式人机循环规划制定研究计划；2) 监督智能体团队进行模块化代码生成；3) 在沙盒模拟环境中进行自主评估和优化的闭环流程。

Result: 在包含16个多样化任务的AgentFL-Bench基准测试中，生成的解决方案与手工设计的基线方法相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

*Emanuele Antonioni,Stefan Markovic,Anirudha Shankar,Jaime Bernardo,Lovro Markovic,Silvia Pareti,Benedetto Proietti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JSPLIT是一个基于分类学的框架，通过层次化组织MCP工具并基于用户查询智能选择相关工具，有效解决提示膨胀问题，在降低提示大小的同时保持甚至提升代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统发展，用户期望从简单的文本交互转向更复杂的代理系统，需要LLM与外部工具交互。MCP等标准使代理能访问工具，但随着工具数量增加导致提示膨胀问题，造成高token成本、延迟增加和任务成功率下降。

Method: JSPLIT框架将工具组织成层次化分类学结构，使用用户提示基于查询和分类学结构识别并仅包含最相关的工具，包括分类学设计、工具选择算法和评估数据集。

Result: JSPLIT显著减少了提示大小，且没有显著影响代理的响应能力。当可用工具数量大幅增加时，JSPLIT甚至提高了代理的工具选择准确性，在降低成本的同时改善了高复杂度代理环境中的任务成功率。

Conclusion: JSPLIT通过分类学驱动的方法有效管理提示大小，解决了MCP工具使用中的提示膨胀问题，在保持代理性能的同时降低了成本，特别适用于工具数量庞大的复杂代理环境。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Conclusion: 通过将高级材料以易于理解的形式重新表述，本文降低了解决推理捷径问题的入门门槛，有望促进可靠神经符号AI和可信AI模型的发展。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理能力的增强，研究其是否能从智能问题解决工具发展为具有自主规划、任务设计和模糊目标推理能力的独立实体。

Method: 采用开放式实验设置，增强预训练LLM代理的能力，使其能够生成自己的任务、积累知识并广泛与环境交互，进行定性研究。

Result: 该代理能够可靠地遵循复杂多步骤指令，跨运行存储和重用信息，提出并解决自己的任务，但对提示设计敏感，容易重复生成任务，且无法形成自我表征。

Conclusion: 研究展示了将预训练LLM适应开放式的潜力和当前局限，为未来训练代理管理记忆、进行有效探索和追求抽象长期目标指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

Conclusion: 提出了基于实验结果改进代理在复杂长时程问题上性能的方向和可行技术路径，为移动代理的全面评估提供了新框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

TL;DR: 本文系统回顾了2021-2025年荷兰公共卫生机器学习研究中算法偏见的识别、讨论和报告情况，开发了RABAT评估工具，发现普遍存在公平性框架缺失等问题，并提出了ACAR四阶段公平性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习有望改善公共卫生，但如果不系统关注算法偏见，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康不平等。需要评估公共卫生ML研究中算法偏见的处理情况。

Method: 开发了RABAT评估工具，整合了Cochrane偏倚风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表等框架，并应用于35篇同行评审研究进行系统文献回顾。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据抽样和缺失数据处理记录良好，但大多数研究缺乏明确的公平性框架、亚组分析和对潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性框架（意识、概念化、应用、报告），为公共卫生ML从业者提供可操作建议，确保算法创新促进而非损害健康公平。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索系统无法在威胁、行为和防御之间进行清晰可逆的推理，需要一种能够将自然语言查询映射到可执行推理路径的系统。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测逻辑关系链，图谱执行器遍历TITAN本体检索事实答案和证据，基于MITRE构建类型化双向图谱。

Result: 构建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示模型能够生成语法有效且语义连贯的可执行推理路径。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询到可执行推理的映射，支持在威胁情报图谱上的确定性推理。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI伦理模型大多基于人类中心视角，存在局限性。需要开发不预设人类道德直觉、能适应动态多智能体环境的伦理框架。

Method: 采用神经符号架构，让智能体在不确定环境中评估行为伦理后果，通过最小化全局期望自由能量来形成伦理行为。

Result: 通过伦理资源分配的案例研究，展示了NAEL能动态平衡自我保存、认知学习和集体福利的能力。

Conclusion: NAEL为AI伦理提供了非人类中心的新范式，能够产生情境敏感、自适应和关系性的伦理行为。

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COUP实用算法配置程序虽然具有强大的理论保证，但实际性能表现不佳。本文旨在弥补这一差距，使基于理论的实用算法配置方法在实践应用中具有竞争力。

Method: 提出了一系列对COUP的改进措施，这些改进在不降低理论保证的前提下提升了算法的经验性能，并通过实验验证了这些改进的效果。

Result: 改进后的COUP在实际性能上能够与广泛使用的启发式配置程序竞争，同时保持理论性能保证。

Conclusion: 通过系统改进，成功将基于理论的实用算法配置方法提升到实用水平，为算法选择问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a

*Bang An,Yibo Yang,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PAVE方法，通过知识感知子空间净化任务向量，消除任务向量中的冗余成分，以提升模型融合性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法中，任务向量包含任务无关的冗余信息，导致融合模型性能显著下降。现有方法随机丢弃参数缺乏知识感知

Method: 使用训练样本获取协方差矩阵，通过上下文导向的奇异值分解识别知识相关权重成分，在知识感知子空间中分离任务相关和冗余组件，并引入谱秩分配策略进行公平剪枝

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案，在各种基于任务向量的融合方法中都能有效提升性能，并在不同任务和模型架构上验证了有效性

Conclusion: PAVE方法通过知识感知的任务向量净化，显著缓解了模型融合中的性能退化问题，具有广泛的适用性

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

TL;DR: 提出一个学习抽象世界模型的框架，联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（包括内生行动和外生机制），通过变分贝叶斯推理和LLM提议从有限数据中学习，在模拟桌面机器人环境中实现快速规划并泛化到更复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视野具身规划中的挑战，因为世界不仅通过智能体行动改变，还存在外生过程（如水温加热、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）与智能体行动同时发生。

Method: 提出抽象世界模型框架，联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（内生行动和外生机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果关系的时序过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提议从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型能够实现快速规划，并泛化到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了长视野具身规划中处理外生过程的挑战，学习到的世界模型支持高效规划并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic cause-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited data
via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across five
simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

TL;DR: CoAST是一个认知对齐的时空大语言模型框架，通过两阶段训练（推荐知识获取和认知对齐）来解决下一个兴趣点推荐任务，结合世界知识、时空轨迹模式和用户画像信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要基于非结构化文本预训练，缺乏对结构化地理实体和序列移动模式的理解，且工业级POI推荐需要结合世界知识和人类认知对齐来提升用户体验和推荐性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 在脱敏用户的时空轨迹数据上进行持续预训练获取推荐知识；2) 通过监督微调和强化学习实现认知对齐，使模型判断与人类偏好一致。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的离线实验和在AMAP App首页"猜你想去"功能的在线实验均证明了CoAST的有效性。

Conclusion: CoAST框架通过自然语言接口成功整合了世界知识、时空轨迹模式、用户画像和情境信息，显著提升了下一个兴趣点推荐的性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合细粒度波束搜索和过程奖励模型ToolPRM的推理扩展框架，用于提升大语言模型在结构化输出（如函数调用）任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在结构化输出（如函数调用）中的应用尚未充分探索，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了首个细粒度调用内过程监督数据集，使用函数掩码技术自动标注步骤级奖励，训练ToolPRM过程奖励模型来评分单个函数调用的内部步骤。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型，表明其在监督函数调用推理过程方面具有更强能力。配备ToolPRM的推理扩展技术显著提升了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则："多探索少保留"，这是由结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复特性决定的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

TL;DR: 论文分析了RLVR方法存在的过度利用偏差问题，提出了SimKO方法来缓解概率过度集中现象，从而提高pass@K性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在系统性偏差，倾向于利用而非探索，表现为pass@1提升但pass@K下降。需要理解训练动态并解决概率过度集中问题。

Method: 提出SimKO方法，采用非对称设计：对验证正确的响应提升top-K候选概率，对验证错误的响应对top-1候选施加更强惩罚，特别在高熵token上应用效果更好。

Result: 在多个数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，SimKO在广泛的K值范围内持续获得更高的pass@K性能。

Conclusion: SimKO提供了一种简单有效的方法来改进RLVR的探索能力，通过缓解概率过度集中问题来平衡利用与探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂真实环境的长视野操作任务中表现不佳，主要受限于常识和推理能力不足，且监督微调方法泛化性差、物理理解不足。

Method: 两阶段微调框架：监督训练从专家序列获取基础知识，强化学习解决视觉空间理解和推理的不足，设计了同时考虑长视野性能和动作约束的基于规则的奖励函数。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练的推理模型在EmbodiedBench基准上比GPT-4o-mini提升21.33%，比Qwen2.5-VL-7B的其他工作提升20.33%。

Conclusion: RoboGPT-R1框架通过结合监督学习和强化学习，有效提升了具身智能体的物理理解和多步推理能力，在复杂操作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个基于LLM的代理系统，通过交互式循环选择性请求必要信息，大幅减少NL2SQL任务中的token使用量，在保持性能的同时降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长、token数量多、处理成本高。

Method: 采用代理式交互循环，在推理框架中让LLM选择性请求必要信息来解决表格问答任务，而非一次性提供所有元信息。

Result: 在23个数据库和100个表格问答任务上评估，Datalake Agent将LLM使用的token减少高达87%，同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent通过选择性信息请求机制，在NL2SQL任务中实现了显著的成本节约，同时维持了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过增加指令遵循率来提高LLM提示指令的可靠性，在2条指令时提升7个百分点，10条指令时提升4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发人员通常通过修改提示来影响LLM行为，但仅仅添加更多指令并不能保证它们会被遵循，需要提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 引入Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，并创建SCALEDIF基准测试（最多包含10条指令的数据样本），开发定量冲突评分工具分析指令冲突。

Result: Instruction Boosting显著提高了指令遵循率，同时发现性能下降与指令数量增加导致的冲突和紧张程度相关。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting有效提升LLM指令遵循可靠性，冲突评分工具为开发者提供了评估额外提示指令对模型性能影响的反馈。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和AI+科学发现方面取得了进展，但搜索的有效性取决于如何将领域先验编码到操作结构化的假设空间中。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入和输出上的模糊关系算子来捕捉可行转换；通过单个延续参数加权所有可达路径并求和得到覆盖生成函数；提供几何解释和可测试推断。

Result: 通过多数投票实例验证了理论，提供了衡量智能体及其搜索空间的可操作工具。

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统化的形式描述语言和操作工具。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Gatekeeper Protocol框架，通过低保真潜在状态表示和按需请求高保真上下文的方法，解决LLM代理在复杂知识系统中的上下文限制和状态同步问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自主代理部署时面临上下文窗口限制和状态不同步问题，导致输出不可靠、行为不可预测和资源使用效率低下，特别是在与代码库和文档等结构化知识系统交互时。

Method: 引入Gatekeeper Protocol框架，让代理先在低保真潜在状态表示上进行操作和推理，然后按需策略性地请求高保真上下文。所有交互通过统一的JSON格式进行，作为声明式的状态同步协议。

Result: 该方法显著提高了代理可靠性，通过最小化token消耗改善了计算效率，并实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: Gatekeeper Protocol为在任何结构化知识领域构建更稳健、可预测和接地气的AI代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要整合来自多个第三方供应商的日志，但供应商文档在测试时往往不可用、不匹配、格式差或不完整，导致模式映射面临挑战。

Method: 使用强化学习智能体，在推理过程中：1)识别模糊的字段映射尝试；2)生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3)应用基于置信度的奖励迭代优化映射。

Result: 将Microsoft Defender for Endpoint日志转换为通用模式，映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)再到93.94%(100次迭代)，同时将需要专家审查的低置信度映射减少了85%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种基于证据、透明的解决方案，为更鲁棒、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、适应性强和协作的解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Conclusion: 对于实际应用，基于判别式验证器的预算感知扩展不仅是自一致性的"免费"升级，而且是比昂贵生成技术更有效和高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

### [316] [Stable but Miscalibrated: A Kantian View on Overconfidence from Filters to Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14925)
*Akira Okutomi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，提出复合不稳定性指数(H-Risk)来衡量推理系统的稳定性，发现在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中，更高的H-Risk预测过度自信错误和幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制概念与反馈控制理论联系起来，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过度自信提供原则性框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk，结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大等指标，在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: 在线性高斯模拟中，更高的H-Risk预测过度自信错误；在LLMs中，脆弱的内部动态与校准错误和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉有混合影响。

Conclusion: 在康德自我限制与反馈控制之间建立了结构性桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过度自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

*Yao Zhang,Yu Wu,Haowei Zhang,Weiguo Li,Haokun Chen,Jingpei Wu,Guohao Li,Zhen Han,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树搜索和外部工具验证的自动过程监督框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，结合步骤级验证和全局结果评估，显著提升多步推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型面临三大挑战：噪声奖励、低事实保真度以及与步骤级推理目标不对齐。这些问题源于缺乏可扩展的高质量标注，现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估或存在信用分配错误的蒙特卡洛估计。

Method: 1) 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，实现细粒度信用分配；2) 通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤，提供执行基础的正确性信号；3) 设计混合奖励聚合机制，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4) 将奖励信号格式化为增强推理的生成结构。

Result: 仅使用4万自动标注样本（最佳自动监督PRM数据量的10%），在ProcessBench上实现高达26%的相对性能提升。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，甚至优于使用人工标注监督训练的PRM。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM为高质量过程级推理提供了一条可扩展且可验证的路径，通过树引导和保真度感知的框架有效解决了现有PRM的核心限制。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了统一多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，通过混合专家适配器和归因思维链机制，能同时检测人工制作和AI生成的多模态虚假内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将人工制作的虚假信息和AI生成内容分开研究，导致模型只能处理单一类型的虚假内容，而现实场景中内容类型通常是未知的，需要统一的检测方案。

Method: 构建了包含12.7万样本的OmniFake数据集，提出UMFDet框架：使用VLM主干网络，结合类别感知的混合专家适配器来捕捉类别特定线索，以及归因思维链机制提供隐式推理指导。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假信息类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能，优于专门的基线模型，为现实世界多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多模态虚假内容检测的空白，提出的统一框架能有效处理未知类型的虚假内容，具有重要的现实应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Conclusion: 理论分析为设计可扩展的多智能体推理系统提供了原则性指导，实证结果证实了理论预测的关键量之间的权衡关系。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has popularized step-by-step reasoning in large
language models, yet model performance still degrades as problem complexity and
context length grow. By decomposing difficult tasks with long contexts into
shorter, manageable ones, recent multi-agent paradigms offer a promising
near-term solution to this problem. However, the fundamental capacities of such
systems are poorly understood. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework
to analyze the expressivity of multi-agent systems. We apply our framework to
three algorithmic families: state tracking, recall, and $k$-hop reasoning. We
derive bounds on (i) the number of agents required to solve the task exactly,
(ii) the quantity and structure of inter-agent communication, and (iii) the
achievable speedups as problem size and context scale. Our results identify
regimes where communication is provably beneficial, delineate tradeoffs between
agent count and bandwidth, and expose intrinsic limitations when either
resource is constrained. We complement our theoretical analysis with a set of
experiments on pretrained LLMs using controlled synthetic benchmarks. Empirical
outcomes confirm the tradeoffs between key quantities predicted by our theory.
Collectively, our analysis offers principled guidance for designing scalable
multi-agent reasoning systems.

Abstract: What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt,
and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering
multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities
for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current
simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by
predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These
limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies.
In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally
inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures
that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as
balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling
to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving
field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness,
continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI
ecosystems. \textbf{We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms
and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent
simulations.}

Motivation: LLM多智能体系统在分布式推理、协作和任务泛化方面具有潜力，但也带来了协议不可保证、级联不确定性和对抗性漏洞等风险，需要确保系统级责任行为。

Method: 提出责任作为全生命周期属性概念，整合主观人类中心价值观和客观可验证性；建立结合跨学科设计和人机协作监督的双视角治理框架。

Result: 将LLM多智能体系统视为统一的动态社会技术系统，需要原则性机制支持责任的各个维度，实现道德对齐、可验证一致性和弹性行为。

Conclusion: 确保LLM多智能体系统责任需要范式转变，从代理级对齐转向系统级一致性，通过双视角治理实现全生命周期的责任追溯和保障。

Abstract: LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) unlock new potentials in
distributed reasoning, collaboration, and task generalization but also
introduce additional risks due to unguaranteed agreement, cascading
uncertainty, and adversarial vulnerabilities. We argue that ensuring
responsible behavior in such systems requires a paradigm shift: from local,
superficial agent-level alignment to global, systemic agreement. We
conceptualize responsibility not as a static constraint but as a lifecycle-wide
property encompassing agreement, uncertainty, and security, each requiring the
complementary integration of subjective human-centered values and objective
verifiability. Furthermore, a dual-perspective governance framework that
combines interdisciplinary design with human-AI collaborative oversight is
essential for tracing and ensuring responsibility throughout the lifecycle of
LLM-MAS. Our position views LLM-MAS not as loose collections of agents, but as
unified, dynamic socio-technical systems that demand principled mechanisms to
support each dimension of responsibility and enable ethically aligned,
verifiably coherent, and resilient behavior for sustained, system-wide
agreement.

Motivation: 现有LLM系统在公共资源池游戏中通常为智能体提供明确的奖励函数，而人类合作往往在没有完全了解收益和群体信息的情况下，通过启发式、沟通和惩罚机制自然产生。

Method: 引入嵌入文化演化机制（社会学习和基于规范的惩罚）的CPR模拟框架，智能体通过环境反馈从收获、监控和惩罚的后果中学习，使规范能够内生演化。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究混合动机LLM社会中涌现规范提供了严谨的测试平台，有助于设计在需要与协作规范对齐的社会和组织环境中部署的AI系统。

Abstract: A growing body of multi-agent studies with Large Language Models (LLMs)
explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where
pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work
has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and
simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool
resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly
tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without
full visibility into payoffs and population, relying instead on heuristics,
communication, and punishment. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that
removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms:
social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and
norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance.
Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring,
and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge
endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key
findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine
norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social
initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and
benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these
conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining
cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed
for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can
inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts,
where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and
effective governance of AI-mediated environments.

Abstract: Power grids increasingly need real-time situational awareness under the
ever-evolving cyberthreat landscape. Advances in snapshot-based system
identification approaches have enabled accurately estimating states and
topology from a snapshot of measurement data, under random bad data and
topology errors. However, modern interactive, targeted false data can stay
undetectable to these methods, and significantly compromise estimation
accuracy. This work advances system identification that combines snapshot-based
method with time-series model via Bayesian Integration, to advance cyber
resiliency against both random and targeted false data. Using a distance-based
time-series model, this work can leverage historical data of different
distributions induced by changes in grid topology and other settings. The
normal system behavior captured from historical data is integrated into system
identification through a Bayesian treatment, to make solutions robust to
targeted false data. We experiment on mixed random anomalies (bad data,
topology error) and targeted false data injection attack (FDIA) to demonstrate
our method's 1) cyber resilience: achieving over 70% reduction in estimation
error under FDIA; 2) anomalous data identification: being able to alarm and
locate anomalous data; 3) almost linear scalability: achieving comparable speed
with the snapshot-based baseline, both taking <1min per time tick on the large
2,383-bus system using a laptop CPU.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别电力系统中的持续性故障源，为系统韧性增强提供早期预警诊断能力。

Abstract: Existing or planned power grids need to evaluate survivability under extreme
events, like a number of peak load overloading conditions, which could possibly
cause system collapses (i.e. blackouts). For realistic extreme events that are
correlated or share similar patterns, it is reasonable to expect that the
dominant vulnerability or failure sources behind them share the same locations
but with different severity. Early warning diagnosis that proactively
identifies the key vulnerabilities responsible for a number of system collapses
of interest can significantly enhance resilience. This paper proposes a
multi-period sparse optimization method, enabling the discovery of {persistent
failure sources} across a sequence of collapsed systems with increasing system
stress, such as rising demand or worsening contingencies. This work defines
persistency and efficiently integrates persistency constraints to capture the
``hidden'' evolving vulnerabilities. Circuit-theory based power flow
formulations and circuit-inspired optimization heuristics are used to
facilitate the scalability of the method. Experiments on benchmark systems show
that the method reliably tracks persistent vulnerability locations under
increasing load stress, and solves with scalability to large systems ({on
average} taking {around} 200 s per scenario on 2000+ bus systems).

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in the security and safety of
cyber-physical control systems, and accurately distinguishing between different
anomaly types is crucial for system recovery and mitigation. This study
proposes a dual detection framework for anomaly detection and discrimination.
By leveraging the dynamic characteristics of control loops and the stealthiness
features of integrity attacks, the closed-loop stealthiness condition is first
derived, and two dedicated detectors are designed and deployed on the
controller side and the plant side, respectively, enabling joint plant fault
and cyber attack detection. Moreover, by jointly analyzing the residual
response of the two detectors corresponding to different anomalies, it is
proved that the proposed method can distinguish between faults and integrity
attacks due to the detectors' individual residual spaces. According to the
detector's residual space, the fault and attack detection performance is
further improved by a two-stage optimization scheme. Simulation results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习OPF求解器都是单值的，无法捕捉系统参数变化导致的调度方案多样性，除非在特征空间中完全表示这些参数，但这在计算上不可行。

Method: 使用扩散模型学习负荷和调度设定点的联合分布，返回以负荷为条件的边际调度分布，从而能够采样统计可信的热启动方案。

Result: DiffOPF能够生成具有良好成本和约束满足权衡的调度方案，并在电力系统基准测试中验证了其与优化解的接近程度。

Conclusion: DiffOPF为多值、非凸的OPF问题提供了一种有效的条件采样解决方案，能够处理系统参数变化带来的调度多样性问题。

Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a multi-valued, non-convex mapping from loads
to dispatch setpoints. The variability of system parameters (e.g., admittances,
topology) further contributes to the multiplicity of dispatch setpoints for a
given load. Existing deep learning OPF solvers are single-valued and thus fail
to capture the variability of system parameters unless fully represented in the
feature space, which is prohibitive. To solve this problem, we introduce a
diffusion-based OPF solver, termed \textit{DiffOPF}, that treats OPF as a
conditional sampling problem. The solver learns the joint distribution of loads
and dispatch setpoints from operational history, and returns the marginal
dispatch distributions conditioned on loads. Unlike single-valued solvers,
DiffOPF enables sampling statistically credible warm starts with favorable cost
and constraint satisfaction trade-offs. We explore the sample complexity of
DiffOPF to ensure the OPF solution within a prescribed distance from the
optimization-based solution, and verify this experimentally on power system
benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统控制屏障函数在固定噪声模型下过于保守，无法准确处理复杂传感器模态中状态相关的误差特性。

Method: 将信念控制屏障函数框架与广义扩展卡尔曼滤波器结合，将测量噪声建模为状态的线性函数。

Result: 在1D单积分器设定点跟踪和2D独轮车运动学轨迹跟踪场景中，BCBF-GEKF方法比原始BCBF框架提供更少保守的控制和更高的安全性。

Conclusion: BCBF-GEKF方法能够有效处理状态相关的测量噪声，在保证安全性的同时减少控制保守性。

Abstract: Safety-critical control is imperative for deploying autonomous systems in the
real world. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer strong safety guarantees
when accurate system and sensor models are available. However, widely used
additive, fixed-noise models are not representative of complex sensor
modalities with state-dependent error characteristics. Although CBFs have been
designed to mitigate uncertainty using fixed worst-case bounds on measurement
noise, this approach can lead to overly-conservative control. To solve this
problem, we extend the Belief Control Barrier Function (BCBF) framework to
accommodate state-dependent measurement noise via the Generalized Extended
Kalman Filter (GEKF) algorithm, which models measurement noise as a linear
function of the state. Using the original BCBF framework as baseline, we
demonstrate the performance of the BCBF-GEKF approach through simulation
results on a 1D single integrator setpoint tracking scenario and 2D unicycle
kinematics trajectory tracking scenario. Our results confirm that the BCBF-GEKF
approach offers less conservative control with greater safety.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注防御攻击，但对隐蔽攻击者如何秘密操控编队行为的研究较少，需要揭示系统脆弱性并为设计弹性对策提供依据。

Method: 通过分析通信拓扑和控制协议，确定隐蔽攻击的可行性条件，并研究攻击者所需的资源，包括对攻击依赖性的系统分析。

Conclusion: 通过表征隐蔽攻击所需资源，本文为解决系统漏洞和设计更安全可靠的CAV系统提供了方法，有助于开发更具弹性的对抗措施。

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are transforming modern
transportation by enabling cooperative applications such as vehicle platooning,
where multiple vehicles travel in close formation to improve efficiency and
safety. However, the heavy reliance on inter-vehicle communication makes
platoons highly susceptible to attacks, where even subtle manipulations can
escalate into severe physical consequences. While existing research has largely
focused on defending against attacks, far less attention has been given to
stealthy adversaries that aim to covertly manipulate platoon behavior. This
paper introduces a new perspective on the attack design problem by
demonstrating how attackers can guide platoons toward their own desired
trajectories while remaining undetected. We outline conditions under which such
attacks are feasible, analyze their dependence on communication topologies and
control protocols, and investigate the resources required by the attacker. By
characterizing the resources needed to launch stealthy attacks, we address
system vulnerabilities and informing the design of resilient countermeasures.
Our findings reveal critical weaknesses in current platoon architectures and
anomaly detection mechanisms and provide methods to develop more secure and
trustworthy CAV systems.

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准的IMDb任务上，压缩方法表现出强大性能，无需重新训练即可减少约80%可训练参数，性能仅下降4-5%。

Conclusion: 提出的压缩方法不仅具有理论保证，而且在实际应用中实现了高效参数减少，优于现有方法，为深度状态空间模型的压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study deep state-space models (Deep SSMs) that contain
linear-quadratic-output (LQO) systems as internal blocks and present a
compression method with a provable output error guarantee. We first derive an
upper bound on the output error between two Deep SSMs and show that the bound
can be expressed via the $h^2$-error norms between the layerwise LQO systems,
thereby providing a theoretical justification for existing model order
reduction (MOR)-based compression. Building on this bound, we formulate an
optimization problem in terms of the $h^2$-error norm and develop a
gradient-based MOR method. On the IMDb task from the Long Range Arena
benchmark, we demonstrate that our compression method achieves strong
performance. Moreover, unlike prior approaches, we reduce roughly 80% of
trainable parameters without retraining, with only a 4-5% performance drop.

Abstract: Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) optimizes power grid upgrades and
investments to ensure reliable, efficient, and cost-effective electricity
delivery while addressing grid constraints. To support growing demand and
renewable energy integration, energy storage is emerging as a pivotal asset
that provides temporal flexibility and alleviates congestion. This paper
develops a multiperiod, two-stage PTDF formulation that co-optimizes
transmission upgrades and storage siting/sizing. To ensure scalability, a
trust-region, multicut Benders scheme warm-started from per-representative-day
optima is proposed. Applied to a 2,000-bus synthetic Texas system under
high-renewable projections, the method attains final optimality gaps below 1%
and yields a plan with storage at about 180 nodes (32% of peak renewable
capacity). These results demonstrate that the proposed PTDF-based methodology
efficiently handles large distributed storage fleets, demonstrating scalability
at high spatial resolution

Motivation: 传统SIS模型无法充分描述媒介传播疾病的复杂动态，需要开发能够同时考虑人类和媒介种群及其相互感染机制的新模型。

Method: 建立包含人类和媒介两个种群的常微分方程组模型，利用单调系统理论分析流行病动态，并引入媒介控制和防护措施激励两种控制策略。

Result: 确定了疾病快速根除的条件（所有轨迹收敛到无病平衡点）或收敛到唯一地方性平衡点的条件，并评估了控制策略的影响。

Conclusion: 该模型为媒介传播疾病的动态分析提供了严格的理论框架，并确定了最优控制政策，有助于疾病防控策略的制定。

Abstract: We propose an epidemic model for the spread of vector-borne diseases. The
model, which is built extending the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible
model, accounts for two populations -- humans and vectors -- and for
cross-contagion between the two species, whereby humans become infected upon
interaction with carrier vectors, and vectors become carriers after interaction
with infected humans. We formulate the model as a system of ordinary
differential equations and leverage monotone systems theory to rigorously
characterize the epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we characterize the global
asymptotic behavior of the disease, determining conditions for quick
eradication of the disease (i.e., for which all trajectories converge to a
disease-free equilibrium), or convergence to a (unique) endemic equilibrium.
Then, we incorporate two control actions: namely, vector control and incentives
to adopt protection measures. Using the derived mathematical tools, we assess
the impact of these two control actions and determine the optimal control
policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式能源并网需要自主动态电压调节，但设计不当的分散式电压-无功控制可能导致电网反馈不稳定

Method: 使用基于历史数据的线性化潮流模型改进LinDistFlow模型，通过最小化稳态电压偏差来设计VVC斜率，并引入非凸谱半径稳定性约束

Result: 在真实馈线上仿真表明，使用谱半径约束比现有凸约束能实现更有效的电压调节

Conclusion: 谱半径稳定性约束在分布式电压-无功控制设计中具有优势，能提供更好的电压调节效果

Abstract: Integration of distributed energy resources has created a need for
autonomous, dynamic voltage regulation. Decentralized Volt-VAr Control (VVC) of
grid-connected inverters presents a unique opportunity for voltage management
but, if designed poorly, can lead to unstable behavior when in feedback with
the grid. We model the grid-VVC closed-loop dynamics with a linearized power
flow approach, leveraging historical data, which shows improvement over the
commonly used LinDistFlow model. This model is used to design VVC slopes by
minimizing steady-state voltage deviation from the nominal value, subject to a
non-convex spectral radius stability constraint, which has not been previously
implemented within this context. We compare this constraint to existing convex
restrictions and demonstrate, through simulations on a realistic feeder, that
using the spectral radius results in more effective voltage regulation.

Motivation: 现有电力系统中QKD应用主要关注点对点安全通信，很少考虑密钥动态与控制调度的系统级耦合，需要解决密钥资源分配冲突并提高系统整体安全性。

Method: 构建统一模型集成量子密钥生成、消耗、库存预测和控制延迟，采用双层Stackelberg博弈框架转化为MPCC问题，开发LD-CP算法求解，并建立端到端协同仿真平台。

Abstract: To address growing cybersecurity challenges in modern power dispatch systems,
this paper proposes a multi-layer modeling and optimization framework for SCADA
systems enhanced with quantum key distribution (QKD). While most existing
applications of QKD in the power sector focus on building secure point-to-point
communication tunnels, they rarely consider the system-level coupling between
key dynamics and control scheduling. In contrast, our approach integrates
quantum key generation, consumption, inventory prediction, and control latency
into a unified model, enabling key-aware reconfiguration of SCADA control
chains based on task security demands and real-time resource constraints. To
resolve conflicts in key resource allocation between transmission system
operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs), we formulate a
bi-level Stackelberg game and transform it into a mathematical program with
complementarity constraints (MPCC). We further develop an efficient Level
Decomposition-Complementarity Pruning (LD-CP) algorithm to solve the problem.
To support reproducible evaluation, we build an end-to-end co-simulation
platform that integrates physical-layer disruptions via OpenQKD-Sim,
Q3P/IEC-104 protocol stack binding, and real-time control-chain monitoring
through Grafana. Experimental results on the IEEE 39- and 118-bus systems show
that our method increases task success rate by 25%, reduces peak frequency
deviation by 70%, and improves key utilization to 83%. This work lays the
foundation for future quantum-secure control systems in power grid operations.

Motivation: 磁感应通信因其优秀的穿透能力成为地下通信网络的有力候选，但MI快速衰落等新发现仍处于早期阶段，需要与下一代移动通信系统的空天地一体化网络集成，因此需要明确定义的网络架构。

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication (MIC) has emerged as a promising
candidate for underground communication networks due to its excellent
penetration capabilities. Integration with Space-Air-Ground-Underground (SAGUI)
networks in next-generation mobile communication systems requires a
well-defined network architecture. A recent discovery in MIC research, MI fast
fading, remains in its early stages and presents unique challenges. This paper
provides a comprehensive survey on through-the-earth (TTE) MIC, covering MI
applications, channel modeling, point-to-point MIC design, relay techniques,
network frameworks, and emerging technologies. We compare various MIC
applications to highlight TTE-specific challenges and review the principles of
channel modeling, addressing both MI slow fading and MI fast fading, along with
its potential impact on existing MIC theories. We conduct a fine-grained
decomposition of MI channel power gain into four distinct physical parameters,
and propose a novel geometric model to analyze MI fast fading. We also
summarize MI relay techniques, examine crosstalk effects in relay and
high-density networks, and explore key research tasks within the OSI framework
for a holistic MI network protocol in SAGUI. To bridge the gaps identified, we
propose a MIC framework that supports TCP/IP and Linux, enabling full
implementation of existing and emerging MIC solutions. This framework empowers
researchers to leverage Linux resources and deep learning platforms for
accelerated development of MIC in SAGUI networks. Remaining research
challenges, open issues, and promising novel techniques are further identified
to advance MIC research.

Conclusion: 提出的控制方法成功解决了非完整移动机器人在安全约束下的镇定问题，为类似系统的控制设计提供了有效框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the stabilization problem for force-controlled
nonholonomic mobile robots under safety-critical constraints. We propose a
continuous, time-invariant control law based on the gamma m-quadratic
programming (gamma m-QP) framework, which unifies control Lyapunov functions
(CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce both stability and
safety in the closed-loop system. For the first time, we construct a global,
time-invariant, strict Lyapunov function for the closed-loop nonholonomic
mobile robot system with a nominal stabilization controller in polar
coordinates; this strict Lyapunov function then serves as the CLF in the QP
design. Next, by exploiting the inherent cascaded structure of the vehicle
dynamics, we develop a CBF for the mobile robot via an integrator backstepping
procedure. Our main results guarantee both asymptotic stability and safety for
the closed-loop system. Both the simulation and experimental results are
presented to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格学习架构在学习高频特征、感受野范围、离散化敏感性和计算效率之间存在微妙的权衡问题，需要一种能够同时克服这些缺陷的新方法。

Method: 采用局部-全局学习框架，在网格梯度域应用学习的局部特征变换，然后求解泊松系统来全局传播标量特征更新。该方法对网格三角化不敏感，保持特征全频谱。

Conclusion: PoissonNet通过泊松方程作为特征传播机制，成功解决了网格学习中的关键挑战，在变形学习等应用中显著优于现有表面学习架构。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明IRV对联盟操纵具有高度抵抗力，但理论原因尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一理论空白，分析不同投票规则在偏好集中度影响下的抗操纵性。

Method: 使用扰动文化模型分析三种投票规则的联盟操纵脆弱性，引入超级孔多塞赢家概念，通过理论证明和实证研究相结合的方法。

Result: 每种投票规则在偏好集中度临界值theta_c处经历相变：低于theta_c时大选区的联盟操纵概率指数收敛于1，高于theta_c时收敛于0。IRV的theta_c=0，即使在最小偏好集中度下也抵抗联盟操纵。

Conclusion: 超级孔多塞赢家的存在是IRV抵抗联盟操纵的关键因素，IRV在抗联盟操纵方面表现最优，其临界值为0使其具有理论上的强健性。

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) is highly
resistant to coalitional manipulation (CM), though the theoretical reasons for
this remain unclear. To address this gap, we analyze the susceptibility to CM
of three major voting rules-Plurality, Two-Round System, and IRV-within the
Perturbed Culture model. Our findings reveal that each rule undergoes a phase
transition at a critical value theta\_c of the concentration of preferences:
the probability of CM for large electorates converges exponentially fast to 1
below theta\_c and to 0 above theta\_c. We introduce the Super Condorcet Winner
(SCW), showing that its presence is a key factor of IRV's resistance to
coalitional manipulation, both theoretically and empirically. Notably, we use
this notion to prove that for IRV, theta\_c = 0, making it resistant to CM with
even minimal preference concentration.

Motivation: 移动边缘计算等新服务需要大规模投资，单一利益相关者难以承担，需要多方共同投资。

Method: 基于鲁棒博弈理论设计随机联盟博弈模型，分析大联盟的稳定性概率下界，并考虑收益性作为共同投资的必要条件。

Result: 当服务提供商收入规模相似且投资周期足够长时，即使存在高度不确定性，联盟稳定性概率下界仍然很高；但在收入高度波动时，稳定性下界较低但共同投资仍然有利可图。

Conclusion: 所提出的共同投资框架在移动边缘计算部署中具有可行性，特别是在收入相似且投资周期长的场景下能够实现稳定的联盟合作。

Abstract: The introduction of new services, such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC),
requires a massive investment that cannot be assumed by a single stakeholder,
for instance the Infrastructure Provider (InP). Service Providers (SPs) however
also have an interest in the deployment of such services. We hence propose a
co-investment scheme in which all stakeholders, i.e., the InP and the SPs, form
the so-called grand coalition composed of all the stakeholders with the aim of
sharing costs and revenues and maximizing their payoffs. The challenge comes
from the fact that future revenues are uncertain. We devise in this case a
novel stochastic coalitional game formulation which builds upon robust game
theory and derive a lower bound on the probability of the stability of the
grand coalition, wherein no player can be better off outside of it. In the
presence of some correlated fluctuations of revenues however, stability can be
too conservative. In this case, we make use also of profitability, in which
payoffs of players are non-negative, as a necessary condition for
co-investment. The proposed framework is showcased for MEC deployment, where
computational resources need to be deployed in nodes at the edge of a
telecommunication network. Numerical results show high lower bound on the
probability of stability when the SPs' revenues are of similar magnitude and
the investment period is sufficiently long, even with high levels of
uncertainty. In the case where revenues are highly variable however, the lower
bound on stability can be trivially low whereas co-investment is still
profitable.

Abstract: In blockchain networks, the strategic ordering of transactions within blocks
has emerged as a significant source of profit extraction, known as Maximal
Extractable Value (MEV). The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions
to structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV
extraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme
time constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces
complex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding
decisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior
or presence. Traditional game-theoretic approaches struggle in this
high-frequency, partially observable environment due to their reliance on
complete information and static equilibrium assumptions. We present a
reinforcement learning framework for MEV extraction on Polygon Atlas and make
three contributions: (1) A novel simulation environment that accurately models
the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and probabilistic competition
in Atlas auctions; (2) A PPO-based bidding agent optimized for real-time
constraints, capable of adaptive strategy formulation in continuous action
spaces while maintaining production-ready inference speeds; (3) Empirical
validation demonstrating our history-conditioned agent captures 49\% of
available profits when deployed alongside existing searchers and 81\% when
replacing the market leader, significantly outperforming static bidding
strategies. Our work establishes that reinforcement learning provides a
critical advantage in high-frequency MEV environments where traditional
optimization methods fail, offering immediate value for industrial participants
and protocol designers alike.

Conclusion: 在线席位分配问题存在基本性能界限，确定性方法偏差线性于政党数量，随机方法在政党较少时能提供更好的公平性保证。结果可应用于在线依赖舍入过程。

Abstract: Traditionally, the problem of apportioning the seats of a legislative body
has been viewed as a one-shot process with no dynamic considerations. While
this approach is reasonable for some settings, dynamic aspects play an
important role in many others. We initiate the study of apportionment problems
in an online setting. Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional
apportionment with no information about the future. In this model, time is
discrete and there are $n$ parties that receive a certain share of the votes at
each time step. An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed
number of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional
share rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to
each party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.
  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods. For
deterministic methods, we construct a family of adversarial instances that
yield a lower bound, linear in $n$, on the worst-case deviation between the
seats allocated to a party and its cumulative share. We show that this bound is
best possible and is matched by a natural greedy method. As a consequence, a
method guaranteeing that the cumulative number of seats assigned to each party
up to any step equals its cumulative share rounded up or down (global quota)
exists if and only if $n\leq 3$. Then, we turn to randomized allocations and
show that, for $n\leq 3$, we can randomize over methods satisfying global quota
with the additional guarantee that each party receives, in expectation, its
proportional share in every step. Our proof is constructive: Any method
satisfying these properties can be obtained from a flow on a recursively
constructed network. We showcase the applicability of our results to obtain
approximate solutions in the context of online dependent rounding procedures.

Motivation: 将博弈学习研究扩展到展现非渐近稳定性的动态，探索个体效用寻求动态与集体理性之间的深层联系。

Method: 使用均匀稳定性概念分析混合纳什均衡，在温和非退化条件下建立均匀稳定性与弱帕累托最优性的等价关系，并研究增量平滑最佳响应动态的收敛行为。

Result: 发现混合均衡的均匀稳定性决定了其弱帕累托最优性：非均匀稳定均衡不是弱帕累托最优的，而局部均匀稳定均衡必须是弱帕累托最优的。

Conclusion: 个体效用寻求行为在混合纳什均衡附近会导致集体理性，这与严格均衡周围可能稳定到社会低效解的情况形成对比。

Abstract: We extend the study of learning in games to dynamics that exhibit
non-asymptotic stability. We do so through the notion of uniform stability,
which is concerned with equilibria of individually utility-seeking dynamics.
Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out to be closely connected to economic
properties of collective rationality. Under mild non-degeneracy conditions and
up to strategic equivalence, if a mixed equilibrium is not uniformly stable,
then it is not weakly Pareto optimal: there is a way for all players to improve
by jointly deviating from the equilibrium. On the other hand, if it is locally
uniformly stable, then the equilibrium must be weakly Pareto optimal. Moreover,
we show that uniform stability determines the last-iterate convergence behavior
for the family of incremental smoothed best-response dynamics, used to model
individual and corporate behaviors in the markets. Unlike dynamics around
strict equilibria, which can stabilize to socially-inefficient solutions,
individually utility-seeking behaviors near mixed Nash equilibria lead to
collective rationality.
