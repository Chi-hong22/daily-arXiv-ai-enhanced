### [1] [Design and Development of a Robotic Transcatheter Delivery System for Aortic Valve Replacement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12082)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型机器人导管输送系统，用于提高TAVR手术中的位置精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TAVR手术中手动操作难以实现精确的瓣膜对齐，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发了一种具有全向弯曲关节和驱动系统的机器人导管输送系统。

Result: 初步实验结果验证了该系统的功能性。

Conclusion: 该系统有望提升TAVR手术的精确性和效率。

Abstract: Minimally invasive transcatheter approaches are increasingly adopted for
aortic stenosis treatment, where optimal commissural and coronary alignment is
important. Achieving precise alignment remains clinically challenging, even
with contemporary robotic transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
devices, as this task is still performed manually. This paper proposes the
development of a robotic transcatheter delivery system featuring an
omnidirectional bending joint and an actuation system designed to enhance
positional accuracy and precision in TAVR procedures. The preliminary
experimental results validate the functionality of this novel robotic system.

### [2] [Using Behavior Trees in Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12089)
*Razan Ghzouli,Atieh Hanna,Endre Erös,Rebekka Wohlrab*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于行为树模型的早期风险评估方法，旨在解决工业实践中安全专家在早期设计阶段难以全面理解机器人任务的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业中早期风险评估的实践不足，安全专家难以在项目初期完全理解机器人任务并确保风险评估结果在实施中被充分考虑。

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，提出基于行为树模型的模型化方法，支持早期风险评估活动。

Result: 通过与四家公司的五位从业者合作评估，发现行为树模型在早期风险识别、可视化和代码实施与风险评估结果之间的桥梁作用具有潜力。

Conclusion: 行为树模型首次用于支持风险评估，研究结果表明需要进一步开发该方法。

Abstract: Cyber-physical production systems increasingly involve collaborative robotic
missions, requiring more demand for robust and safe missions. Industries rely
on risk assessments to identify potential failures and implement measures to
mitigate their risks. Although it is recommended to conduct risk assessments
early in the design of robotic missions, the state of practice in the industry
is different. Safety experts often struggle to completely understand robotics
missions at the early design stages of projects and to ensure that the output
of risk assessments is adequately considered during implementation.
  This paper presents a design science study that conceived a model-based
approach for early risk assessment in a development-centric way. Our approach
supports risk assessment activities by using the behavior-tree model. We
evaluated the approach together with five practitioners from four companies.
Our findings highlight the potential of the behavior-tree model in supporting
early identification, visualisation, and bridging the gap between code
implementation and risk assessments' outputs. This approach is the first
attempt to use the behavior-tree model to support risk assessment; thus, the
findings highlight the need for further development.

### [3] [DoublyAware: Dual Planning and Policy Awareness for Temporal Difference Learning in Humanoid Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12095)
*Khang Nguyen,An T. Le,Jan Peters,Minh Nhat Vu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出DoublyAware方法，通过分解不确定性和结合规划与策略优化，提升人形机器人运动的鲁棒性和学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型强化学习中环境随机性和高维动作空间带来的不确定性挑战，提升学习稳定性和探索效率。

Method: 提出DoublyAware方法，分解不确定性为规划和策略两部分，使用conformal prediction和GRPC优化器分别处理。

Result: 在HumanoidBench测试中，DoublyAware表现出更高的样本效率、收敛速度和运动可行性。

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性建模对TD-MPC框架下的人形机器人运动学习至关重要。

Abstract: Achieving robust robot learning for humanoid locomotion is a fundamental
challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where environmental
stochasticity and randomness can hinder efficient exploration and learning
stability. The environmental, so-called aleatoric, uncertainty can be amplified
in high-dimensional action spaces with complex contact dynamics, and further
entangled with epistemic uncertainty in the models during learning phases. In
this work, we propose DoublyAware, an uncertainty-aware extension of Temporal
Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC) that explicitly decomposes
uncertainty into two disjoint interpretable components, i.e., planning and
policy uncertainties. To handle the planning uncertainty, DoublyAware employs
conformal prediction to filter candidate trajectories using quantile-calibrated
risk bounds, ensuring statistical consistency and robustness against stochastic
dynamics. Meanwhile, policy rollouts are leveraged as structured informative
priors to support the learning phase with Group-Relative Policy Constraint
(GRPC) optimizers that impose a group-based adaptive trust-region in the latent
action space. This principled combination enables the robot agent to prioritize
high-confidence, high-reward behavior while maintaining effective, targeted
exploration under uncertainty. Evaluated on the HumanoidBench locomotion suite
with the Unitree 26-DoF H1-2 humanoid, DoublyAware demonstrates improved sample
efficiency, accelerated convergence, and enhanced motion feasibility compared
to RL baselines. Our simulation results emphasize the significance of
structured uncertainty modeling for data-efficient and reliable decision-making
in TD-MPC-based humanoid locomotion learning.

*Stanley Lewis,Vishal Chandra,Tom Gao,Odest Chadwicke Jenkins*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPLATART是一种从姿态图像中学习关节物体高斯溅射表示的管道，解决了复杂关节物体表示和学习的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关节物体的表示在机器人领域仍具挑战性，尤其是多自由度物体（如机械臂）的几何、颜色、部件分离和关节参数化。

Method: SPLATART通过分离部件分割和关节估计任务，支持更深层次的运动树结构表示。

Result: 在合成Paris数据集上展示了数据，并在真实物体上验证了稀疏分割监督的定性结果。

Conclusion: SPLATART能够处理更复杂的关节物体，扩展了现有方法的适用范围。

Abstract: Representing articulated objects remains a difficult problem within the field
of robotics. Objects such as pliers, clamps, or cabinets require
representations that capture not only geometry and color information, but also
part seperation, connectivity, and joint parametrization. Furthermore, learning
these representations becomes even more difficult with each additional degree
of freedom. Complex articulated objects such as robot arms may have seven or
more degrees of freedom, and the depth of their kinematic tree may be notably
greater than the tools, drawers, and cabinets that are the typical subjects of
articulated object research. To address these concerns, we introduce SPLATART -
a pipeline for learning Gaussian splat representations of articulated objects
from posed images, of which a subset contains image space part segmentations.
SPLATART disentangles the part separation task from the articulation estimation
task, allowing for post-facto determination of joint estimation and
representation of articulated objects with deeper kinematic trees than
previously exhibited. In this work, we present data on the SPLATART pipeline as
applied to the syntheic Paris dataset objects, and qualitative results on a
real-world object under spare segmentation supervision. We additionally present
on articulated serial chain manipulators to demonstrate usage on deeper
kinematic tree structures.

TL;DR: ViTaSCOPE提出了一种结合视觉和高分辨率触觉反馈的神经隐式表示方法，用于精确估计物体位姿和外部接触位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在灵巧操作中，部分和噪声观测使得物体位姿和接触位置的精确估计具有挑战性。

Method: 通过将物体表示为有符号距离场，触觉反馈表示为神经剪切场，ViTaSCOPE融合视觉和触觉数据，利用仿真进行可扩展训练。

Conclusion: ViTaSCOPE通过结合视觉和触觉反馈，成功解决了灵巧操作中的位姿和接触估计问题。

Abstract: Mastering dexterous, contact-rich object manipulation demands precise
estimation of both in-hand object poses and external contact
locations$\unicode{x2013}$tasks particularly challenging due to partial and
noisy observations. We present ViTaSCOPE: Visuo-Tactile Simultaneous Contact
and Object Pose Estimation, an object-centric neural implicit representation
that fuses vision and high-resolution tactile feedback. By representing objects
as signed distance fields and distributed tactile feedback as neural shear
fields, ViTaSCOPE accurately localizes objects and registers extrinsic contacts
onto their 3D geometry as contact fields. Our method enables seamless reasoning
over complementary visuo-tactile cues by leveraging simulation for scalable
training and zero-shot transfers to the real-world by bridging the sim-to-real
gap. We evaluate our method through comprehensive simulated and real-world
experiments, demonstrating its capabilities in dexterous manipulation
scenarios.

### [6] [ProVox: Personalization and Proactive Planning for Situated Human-Robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12248)
*Jennifer Grannen,Siddharth Karamcheti,Blake Wulfe,Dorsa Sadigh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ProVox框架通过个性化提示和主动语言模型任务规划，帮助协作机器人更快适应人类意图，减少用户负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作机器人需快速适应人类意图和偏好，以主动提供帮助，尤其是在动态环境中。

Method: 提出ProVox框架，结合元提示协议和主动语言模型任务规划，从交互上下文中推断用户目标。

Result: 实验显示，ProVox使任务完成时间减少38.7%，用户负担降低31.9%。

Conclusion: 元提示和主动性是关键，显著提升了协作效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Collaborative robots must quickly adapt to their partner's intent and
preferences to proactively identify helpful actions. This is especially true in
situated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new
high-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through
demonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work
together to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should
be able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this
information to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from
the user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large
language models, we introduce ProVox ("Proactive Voice"), a novel framework
that enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual
collaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to
communicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors
ahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized
prompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a
user's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to
suggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the
amount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot.
We evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation
tasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the
collaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use,
and reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity
are critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less
user burden relative to non-active baselines. Supplementary material, code, and
videos can be found at https://provox-2025.github.io.

### [7] [Strategic Vantage Selection for Learning Viewpoint-Agnostic Manipulation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12261)
*Sreevishakh Vasudevan,Som Sagar,Ransalu Senanayake*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vantage框架通过优化视角选择，训练出视角无关的操纵策略，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于视觉的操纵策略在训练视角外泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 利用贝叶斯优化选择最优视角，迭代微调策略。

Result: 在多种任务中平均性能提升46.19%。

Conclusion: Vantage框架通过高效视角选择，显著提升操纵策略的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-based manipulation has shown remarkable success, achieving promising
performance across a range of tasks. However, these manipulation policies often
fail to generalize beyond their training viewpoints, which is a persistent
challenge in achieving perspective-agnostic manipulation, especially in
settings where the camera is expected to move at runtime. Although collecting
data from many angles seems a natural solution, such a naive approach is both
resource-intensive and degrades manipulation policy performance due to
excessive and unstructured visual diversity. This paper proposes Vantage, a
framework that systematically identifies and integrates data from optimal
perspectives to train robust, viewpoint-agnostic policies. By formulating
viewpoint selection as a continuous optimization problem, we iteratively
fine-tune policies on a few vantage points. Since we leverage Bayesian
optimization to efficiently navigate the infinite space of potential camera
configurations, we are able to balance exploration of novel views and
exploitation of high-performing ones, thereby ensuring data collection from a
minimal number of effective viewpoints. We empirically evaluate this framework
on diverse standard manipulation tasks using multiple policy learning methods,
demonstrating that fine-tuning with data from strategic camera placements
yields substantial performance gains, achieving average improvements of up to
46.19% when compared to fixed, random, or heuristic-based strategies.

### [8] [Role of Uncertainty in Model Development and Control Design for a Manufacturing Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12273)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 多机器人控制系统可显著减少制造中的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在微观制造中仍优于机器人，因其能利用感官线索补偿不确定性。机器人虽配备先进传感器和处理器，但控制算法是更经济的替代方案。

Method: 设计多机器人控制系统以减少制造任务中的不确定性。

Result: 多机器人控制系统能大幅减少多种不确定性。

Conclusion: 多机器人控制系统是减少制造不确定性的有效且经济的方法。

Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in
the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform
machines, especially in the micro scale manufacturing, which requires
high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for
high level of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity) etc. Although
advanced metrology sensors and high-precision microprocessors, which are
utilized in nowadays robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, but a well-designed control algorithm still works
as a comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system can
reduce various uncertainties to a great amount.

Abstract: This review explores the potential of foundation models to advance laboratory
automation in the materials and chemical sciences. It emphasizes the dual roles
of these models: cognitive functions for experimental planning and data
analysis, and physical functions for hardware operations. While traditional
laboratory automation has relied heavily on specialized, rigid systems,
foundation models offer adaptability through their general-purpose intelligence
and multimodal capabilities. Recent advancements have demonstrated the
feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) and multimodal robotic
systems to handle complex and dynamic laboratory tasks. However, significant
challenges remain, including precision manipulation of hardware, integration of
multimodal data, and ensuring operational safety. This paper outlines a roadmap
highlighting future directions, advocating for close interdisciplinary
collaboration, benchmark establishment, and strategic human-AI integration to
realize fully autonomous experimental laboratories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升膝关节的爆炸性功率输出以增强人形机器人的敏捷性和越障能力。

Method: 采用动态减小减速比的策略，设计线性执行器驱动的导杆机构，并通过参数优化实现。

Result: 实验验证显示单关节平台垂直跳跃高度达63厘米（比固定减速比设计提升28.1%），人形机器人实现了1.1米远跳和0.5米高跳。

Conclusion: 动态减速比设计显著提升了跳跃性能，为人形机器人的运动能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Enhancing the explosive power output of the knee joints is critical for
improving the agility and obstacle-crossing capabilities of humanoid robots.
However, a mismatch between the knee-to-center-of-mass (CoM) transmission ratio
and jumping demands, coupled with motor performance degradation at high speeds,
restricts the duration of high-power output and limits jump performance. To
address these problems, this paper introduces a novel knee joint design
paradigm employing a dynamically decreasing reduction ratio for explosive
output during jump. Analysis of motor output characteristics and knee
kinematics during jumping inspired a coupling strategy in which the reduction
ratio gradually decreases as the joint extends. A high initial ratio rapidly
increases torque at jump initiation, while its gradual reduction minimizes
motor speed increments and power losses, thereby maintaining sustained
high-power output. A compact and efficient linear actuator-driven guide-rod
mechanism realizes this coupling strategy, supported by parameter optimization
guided by explosive jump control strategies. Experimental validation
demonstrated a 63 cm vertical jump on a single-joint platform (a theoretical
improvement of 28.1\% over the optimal fixed-ratio joints). Integrated into a
humanoid robot, the proposed design enabled a 1.1 m long jump, a 0.5 m vertical
jump, and a 0.5 m box jump.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出AntiGrounding框架，通过反向指令接地过程，直接在VLM表示空间中生成候选动作，实现零样本合成最优闭环机器人轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将高维表示空间压缩为中间表示，丢失了任务关键信息（如细粒度空间或语义细节）。

Method: 提出AntiGrounding框架，反向指令接地，多视角渲染轨迹，结构化视觉问答辅助决策，并引入离线策略优化模块。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中，方法优于基线，适用于多样化机器人操作任务。

Conclusion: AntiGrounding框架有效保留任务关键信息，提升零样本任务表现和长期性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode knowledge and reasoning capabilities for
robotic manipulation within high-dimensional representation spaces. However,
current approaches often project them into compressed intermediate
representations, discarding important task-specific information such as
fine-grained spatial or semantic details. To address this, we propose
AntiGrounding, a new framework that reverses the instruction grounding process.
It lifts candidate actions directly into the VLM representation space, renders
trajectories from multiple views, and uses structured visual question answering
for instruction-based decision making. This enables zero-shot synthesis of
optimal closed-loop robot trajectories for new tasks. We also propose an
offline policy refinement module that leverages past experience to enhance
long-term performance. Experiments in both simulation and real-world
environments show that our method outperforms baselines across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks.

*Pablo Gonzalez-Oliveras,Olov Engwall,Ali Reza Majlesi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究表明，社交教育机器人对高中生的决策有显著影响，尤其是在机器人表现出高确定性时，学生更容易接受其观点，但也可能因此受到错误信息的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社交教育机器人对学生决策的影响，以及机器人表现出的确定性水平如何影响学生的接受度和感知可信度。

Method: 40名高中生参与实验，机器人对8道判断题提供答案（6对2错），并分为高、中、低三种确定性表现。

Result: 75%的学生受机器人影响，高确定性条件下学生接受度最高（94.4%），低确定性条件下显著降低（71.4%）。

Conclusion: 教育机器人应根据信息可靠性调整确定性表现，以促进学生批判性思维，减少不当影响。

Abstract: This study with 40 high-school students demonstrates the high influence of a
social educational robot on students' decision-making for a set of eight
true-false questions on electric circuits, for which the theory had been
covered in the students' courses. The robot argued for the correct answer on
six questions and the wrong on two, and 75% of the students were persuaded by
the robot to perform beyond their expected capacity, positively when the robot
was correct and negatively when it was wrong. Students with more experience of
using large language models were even more likely to be influenced by the
robot's stance -- in particular for the two easiest questions on which the
robot was wrong -- suggesting that familiarity with AI can increase
susceptibility to misinformation by AI.
  We further examined how three different levels of portrayed robot certainty,
displayed using semantics, prosody and facial signals, affected how the
students aligned with the robot's answer on specific questions and how
convincing they perceived the robot to be on these questions. The students
aligned with the robot's answers in 94.4% of the cases when the robot was
portrayed as Certain, 82.6% when it was Neutral and 71.4% when it was
Uncertain. The alignment was thus high for all conditions, highlighting
students' general susceptibility to accept the robot's stance, but alignment in
the Uncertain condition was significantly lower than in the Certain. Post-test
questionnaire answers further show that students found the robot most
convincing when it was portrayed as Certain. These findings highlight the need
for educational robots to adjust their display of certainty based on the
reliability of the information they convey, to promote students' critical
thinking and reduce undue influence.

Motivation: 现实环境中的机器人任务规划需要理解物体间的空间关系，但现有数据集缺乏详细的空间关系标注。

Method: 使用波士顿动力Spot机器人采集近1000张室内图像，并通过自定义标注工具标注物体属性、位置和空间关系。

Result: 实验表明，将显式空间关系整合到基础模型（如ChatGPT 4o）中，显著提升了机器人空间感知任务规划的能力。

Conclusion: 公开的数据集和标注工具支持机器人空间推理的进一步研究。

Abstract: Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires not only object
recognition but also a nuanced understanding of spatial relationships between
objects. We present a spatial-relationship-aware dataset of nearly 1,000
robot-acquired indoor images, annotated with object attributes, positions, and
detailed spatial relationships. Captured using a Boston Dynamics Spot robot and
labelled with a custom annotation tool, the dataset reflects complex scenarios
with similar or identical objects and intricate spatial arrangements. We
benchmark six state-of-the-art scene-graph generation models on this dataset,
analysing their inference speed and relational accuracy. Our results highlight
significant differences in model performance and demonstrate that integrating
explicit spatial relationships into foundation models, such as ChatGPT 4o,
substantially improves their ability to generate executable, spatially-aware
plans for robotics. The dataset and annotation tool are publicly available at
https://github.com/PengPaulWang/SpatialAwareRobotDataset, supporting further
research in spatial reasoning for robotics.

Result: 热-陀螺融合显著降低热成像分辨率需求，同时保持精度，提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于资源受限的实时机器人系统，并公开数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Accurate rotational odometry is crucial for autonomous robotic systems,
particularly for small, power-constrained platforms such as drones and mobile
robots. This study introduces thermal-gyro fusion, a novel sensor fusion
approach that integrates ultra-low-resolution thermal imaging with gyroscope
readings for rotational odometry. Unlike RGB cameras, thermal imaging is
invariant to lighting conditions and, when fused with gyroscopic data,
mitigates drift which is a common limitation of inertial sensors. We first
develop a multimodal data acquisition system to collect synchronized thermal
and gyroscope data, along with rotational speed labels, across diverse
environments. Subsequently, we design and train a lightweight Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) that fuses both modalities for rotational speed
estimation. Our analysis demonstrates that thermal-gyro fusion enables a
significant reduction in thermal camera resolution without significantly
compromising accuracy, thereby improving computational efficiency and memory
utilization. These advantages make our approach well-suited for real-time
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems. Finally, to facilitate
further research, we publicly release our dataset as supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标机器人操作任务的目标空间多样且复杂，现有方法如HER和GAIL在演示数据不足时效率低下，尤其是面对复杂子任务时。

Method: 提出Goal-SAGAIL框架，结合自适应性学习和目标条件GAIL，优化模仿学习效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种多目标操作任务中显著提高了学习效率，包括复杂的手内操作任务。

Conclusion: Goal-SAGAIL是一种高效的多目标机器人操作任务解决方案，尤其适用于演示数据有限或次优的情况。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for multi-goal robot manipulation tasks poses
significant challenges due to the diversity and complexity of the goal space.
Techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) have been introduced to
improve learning efficiency for such tasks. More recently, researchers have
combined HER with advanced imitation learning methods such as Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to integrate demonstration data and
accelerate training speed. However, demonstration data often fails to provide
enough coverage for the goal space, especially when acquired from human
teleoperation. This biases the learning-from-demonstration process toward
mastering easier sub-tasks instead of tackling the more challenging ones. In
this work, we present Goal-based Self-Adaptive Generative Adversarial Imitation
Learning (Goal-SAGAIL), a novel framework specifically designed for multi-goal
robot manipulation tasks. By integrating self-adaptive learning principles with
goal-conditioned GAIL, our approach enhances imitation learning efficiency,
even when limited, suboptimal demonstrations are available. Experimental
results validate that our method significantly improves learning efficiency
across various multi-goal manipulation scenarios -- including complex in-hand
manipulation tasks -- using suboptimal demonstrations provided by both
simulation and human experts.

*Pranay Gupta,Henny Admoni,Andrea Bajcsy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过专家反馈的功能对应关系，将训练时的行为直接迁移到视觉分布外（OOD）条件，减少重新训练的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端视觉运动策略在OOD条件下表现不佳，传统方法需要高成本的专家纠正演示。本文发现某些OOD条件与训练条件功能相似，无需新行为。

Method: 方法包括检测OOD条件、识别行为差异、获取功能对应反馈，并用对应ID观察干预OOD观察。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法能有效提升视觉扩散策略在OOD条件下的泛化能力，且反馈成本低。

Conclusion: 通过功能对应反馈，无需重新训练即可实现OOD条件下的高效泛化。

Abstract: End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a
remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors.
However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when
faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds,
or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit
corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be
costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does
not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can
directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities
with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with
in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil.
The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally
correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an
expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of
collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our
method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current
observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training
observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence
feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD
observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform
deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse
real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator.
Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the
generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and
environment conditions with low feedback.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed
AI systems with unified perception, reasoning and natural-language interaction
across text, image and video streams. Meanwhile, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
swarms are increasingly deployed in dynamic, safety-critical missions that
demand rapid situational understanding and autonomous adaptation. This paper

analyze how MLLMs can enhance the UAV system performance in terms of target
detection, autonomous navigation, and multi-agent coordination, while exploring
solutions for integrating MLLMs into UAV systems. Next, we propose a practical

TL;DR: FB-NTFields提出了一种新的神经场表示方法，通过构建潜在空间表示来解决PiNMPs在运动规划中的可扩展性问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PiNMPs受限于谱偏差和PDE驱动的复杂损失景观，且传统域分解方法无法满足运动规划的空间连通性需求。

Method: FB-NTFields通过潜在空间表示计算起点和目标的成本函数，结合域分解确保全局空间一致性。

Result: 在复杂合成和真实场景中验证了FB-NTFields的优越性，并在四足机器人上成功部署。

Conclusion: FB-NTFields为大规模运动规划提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed Neural Motion Planners (PiNMPs) provide a data-efficient
framework for solving the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and
representing the cost-to-go function for motion planning. However, their
scalability remains limited by spectral bias and the complex loss landscape of
PDE-driven training. Domain decomposition mitigates these issues by dividing
the environment into smaller subdomains, but existing methods enforce
continuity only at individual spatial points. While effective for function
approximation, these methods fail to capture the spatial connectivity required
for motion planning, where the cost-to-go function depends on both the start
and goal coordinates rather than a single query point. We propose Finite Basis
Neural Time Fields (FB-NTFields), a novel neural field representation for
scalable cost-to-go estimation. Instead of enforcing continuity in output
space, FB-NTFields construct a latent space representation, computing the
cost-to-go as a distance between the latent embeddings of start and goal
coordinates. This enables global spatial coherence while integrating domain
decomposition, ensuring efficient large-scale motion planning. We validate
FB-NTFields in complex synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating
substantial improvements over existing PiNMPs. Finally, we deploy our method on
a Unitree B1 quadruped robot, successfully navigating indoor environments. The

Conclusion: 该方法为水下车辆提供了更全面的环境感知能力，并在实时导航规划中表现出优越性。

Abstract: In autonomous underwater missions, the successful completion of predefined
paths mainly depends on the ability of underwater vehicles to recognise their
surroundings. In this study, we apply the concept of Fast Interval Type-2 Fuzzy
Extreme Learning Machine (FIT2-FELM) to train a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang IT2 Fuzzy
Inference System (TSK IT2-FIS) for on-board sonar data classification using an
underwater vehicle called BlueROV2. The TSK IT2-FIS is integrated into a
Hierarchical Navigation Strategy (HNS) as the main navigation engine to infer
local motions and provide the BlueROV2 with full autonomy to follow an
obstacle-free trajectory in a water container of 2.5m x 2.5m x 3.5m. Compared
to traditional navigation architectures, using the proposed method, we observe
a robust path following behaviour in the presence of uncertainty and noise. We
found that the proposed approach provides the BlueROV with a more complete
sensory picture about its surroundings while real-time navigation planning is
performed by the concurrent execution of two or more tasks.

Conclusion: RLPF成功实现了文本到可执行机器人动作的转化，适用于真实人形机器人部署。

Abstract: This paper focuses on a critical challenge in robotics: translating
text-driven human motions into executable actions for humanoid robots, enabling
efficient and cost-effective learning of new behaviors. While existing
text-to-motion generation methods achieve semantic alignment between language
and motion, they often produce kinematically or physically infeasible motions
unsuitable for real-world deployment. To bridge this sim-to-real gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning from Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that integrates physics-aware motion evaluation with text-conditioned motion
generation. RLPF employs a motion tracking policy to assess feasibility in a
physics simulator, generating rewards for fine-tuning the motion generator.
Furthermore, RLPF introduces an alignment verification module to preserve
semantic fidelity to text instructions. This joint optimization ensures both
physical plausibility and instruction alignment. Extensive experiments show
that RLPF greatly outperforms baseline methods in generating physically
feasible motions while maintaining semantic correspondence with text
instruction, enabling successful deployment on real humanoid robots.

Abstract: Achieving general agile whole-body control on humanoid robots remains a major
challenge due to diverse motion demands and data conflicts. While existing
frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to
generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control
requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose
BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion
clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first
leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar
motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then
trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative
delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are
distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and
robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real
humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body
control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid
performance in the real world.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are promising to acquire various skills by imitating human
behaviors. However, existing algorithms are only capable of tracking smooth,
low-speed human motions, even with delicate reward and curriculum design. This
paper presents a physics-based humanoid control framework, aiming to master
highly-dynamic human behaviors such as Kungfu and dancing through multi-steps
motion processing and adaptive motion tracking. For motion processing, we
design a pipeline to extract, filter out, correct, and retarget motions, while
ensuring compliance with physical constraints to the maximum extent. For motion
imitation, we formulate a bi-level optimization problem to dynamically adjust
the tracking accuracy tolerance based on the current tracking error, creating
an adaptive curriculum mechanism. We further construct an asymmetric
actor-critic framework for policy training. In experiments, we train whole-body
control policies to imitate a set of highly-dynamic motions. Our method
achieves significantly lower tracking errors than existing approaches and is
successfully deployed on the Unitree G1 robot, demonstrating stable and
expressive behaviors. The project page is https://kungfu-bot.github.io.

correlated with task statistics, such as rewards, but also correlated with
participants' characteristics, especially robot experience and educational
background. Additionally, we demonstrated that human feedback value can be more
accurately predicted with human characteristics compared to only using task
statistics. All human feedback and characteristics we collected, and codes for

Abstract: Solving Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems is fundamental to robotics, but has
primarily been successful with single serial manipulators. For multi-arm
robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled
joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK
solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this
paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and
diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns
the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex
dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems
of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional
objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and
adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different
multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy,
precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing
solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach
to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂环境下的平台设计和主动SLAM系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the field of multi-sensor fusion for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), monocular cameras and IMUs are widely used to build simple and
effective visual-inertial systems. However, limited research has explored the
integration of motor-encoder devices to enhance SLAM performance. By
incorporating such devices, it is possible to significantly improve active
capability and field of view (FOV) with minimal additional cost and structural
complexity. This paper proposes a novel visual-inertial-encoder tightly coupled
odometry (VIEO) based on a ViDAR (Video Detection and Ranging) device. A ViDAR
calibration method is introduced to ensure accurate initialization for VIEO. In
addition, a platform motion decoupled active SLAM method based on deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. Experimental data demonstrate that
the proposed ViDAR and the VIEO algorithm significantly increase cross-frame
co-visibility relationships compared to its corresponding visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) algorithm, improving state estimation accuracy. Additionally,
the DRL-based active SLAM algorithm, with the ability to decouple from platform
motion, can increase the diversity weight of the feature points and further
enhance the VIEO algorithm's performance. The proposed methodology sheds fresh
insights into both the updated platform design and decoupled approach of active
SLAM systems in complex environments.

Conclusion: 提供了一种无需基础设施的解决方案，适用于单UUV在复杂水下环境中跟踪非合作目标。

Abstract: Accurate relative state observation of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs)
for tracking uncooperative targets remains a significant challenge due to the
absence of GPS, complex underwater dynamics, and sensor limitations. Existing
localization approaches rely on either global positioning infrastructure or
multi-UUV collaboration, both of which are impractical for a single UUV
operating in large or unknown environments. To address this, we propose a novel
persistent relative 6D state estimation framework that enables a single UUV to
estimate its relative motion to a non-cooperative target using only successive
noisy range measurements from two monostatic sonar sensors. Our key
contribution is an observability-enhanced attitude control strategy, which
optimally adjusts the UUV's orientation to improve the observability of
relative state estimation using a Kalman filter, effectively mitigating the
impact of sensor noise and drift accumulation. Additionally, we introduce a
rigorously proven Lyapunov-based tracking control strategy that guarantees
long-term stability by ensuring that the UUV maintains an optimal measurement
range, preventing localization errors from diverging over time. Through
theoretical analysis and simulations, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves 6D relative state estimation accuracy and robustness
compared to conventional approaches. This work provides a scalable,
infrastructure-free solution for UUVs tracking uncooperative targets
underwater.

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly being explored as tools to support emotional
wellbeing, particularly in non-clinical settings. Drawing on a range of
empirical studies and practical deployments, this paper outlines six key
insights that highlight both the opportunities and challenges in using robots
to promote mental wellbeing. These include (1) the lack of a single, objective
measure of wellbeing, (2) the fact that robots don't need to act as companions
to be effective, (3) the growing potential of virtual interactions, (4) the
importance of involving clinicians in the design process, (5) the difference
between one-off and long-term interactions, and (6) the idea that adaptation
and personalization are not always necessary for positive outcomes. Rather than
positioning robots as replacements for human therapists, we argue that they are
best understood as supportive tools that must be designed with care, grounded
in evidence, and shaped by ethical and psychological considerations. Our aim is
to inform future research and guide responsible, effective use of robots in
mental health and wellbeing contexts.

Conclusion: 该策略为对抗非合作敌对无人机提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Commercial UAVs are an emerging security threat as they are capable of
carrying hazardous payloads or disrupting air traffic. To counter UAVs, we
introduce an autonomous 3D target encirclement and interception strategy.
Unlike traditional ground-guided systems, this strategy employs autonomous
drones to track and engage non-cooperative hostile UAVs, which is effective in
non-line-of-sight conditions, GPS denial, and radar jamming, where conventional
detection and neutralization from ground guidance fail. Using two noisy
real-time distances measured by drones, guardian drones estimate the relative
position from their own to the target using observation and velocity
compensation methods, based on anti-synchronization (AS) and an X$-$Y circular
motion combined with vertical jitter. An encirclement control mechanism is
proposed to enable UAVs to adaptively transition from encircling and protecting
a target to encircling and monitoring a hostile target. Upon breaching a
warning threshold, the UAVs may even employ a suicide attack to neutralize the
hostile target. We validate this strategy through real-world UAV experiments
and simulated analysis in MATLAB, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting,
encircling, and intercepting hostile drones. More details:

This introduces multiple equilibrium points corresponding to the zero state of
the error dynamic system during carrier-passenger separation. The change of
equilibrium points is associated with the change in their attraction regions,
enabling smooth carrier-passenger separation and afterwards seamless navigation
toward the target. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of the proposed controller in environments containing obstacles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分布式协调约束任务执行（C2TE）算法，使多车道车辆团队能灵活排序合并为目标车道上的车队。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多车辆团队在合并任务中灵活排序的需求，避免预设空间顺序的限制。

Method: 将任务分为预合并调节和灵活排序合并两阶段，分别用分布式约束优化问题建模，并利用控制屏障函数（CBF）约束实现安全距离和碰撞避免。

Conclusion: C2TE算法成功实现了灵活排序的车队合并，适用于多种复杂场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed coordinated constrained task
execution (C2TE) algorithm that enables a team of vehicles from different lanes
to cooperatively merge into an {\it ordering-flexible platoon} maneuvering on
the desired lane. Therein, the platoon is flexible in the sense that no
specific spatial ordering sequences of vehicles are predetermined. To attain
such a flexible platoon, we first separate the multi-vehicle platoon (MVP)
merging mission into two stages, namely, pre-merging regulation and {\it
ordering-flexible platoon} merging, and then formulate them into distributed
constraint-based optimization problems. Particularly, by encoding
longitudinal-distance regulation and same-lane collision avoidance subtasks
into the corresponding control barrier function (CBF) constraints, the proposed
algorithm in Stage 1 can safely enlarge sufficient longitudinal distances among
adjacent vehicles. Then, by encoding lateral convergence, longitudinal-target
attraction, and neighboring collision avoidance subtasks into CBF constraints,
the proposed algorithm in Stage~2 can efficiently achieve the {\it
ordering-flexible platoon}. Note that the {\it ordering-flexible platoon} is
realized through the interaction of the longitudinal-target attraction and
time-varying neighboring collision avoidance constraints simultaneously.
Feasibility guarantee and rigorous convergence analysis are both provided under
strong nonlinear couplings induced by flexible orderings. Finally, experiments
using three autonomous mobile vehicles (AMVs) are conducted to verify the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed algorithm, and extensive
simulations are performed to demonstrate its robustness, adaptability, and
scalability when tackling vehicles' sudden breakdown, new appearing, different
number of lanes, mixed autonomy, and large-scale scenarios, respectively.

Conclusion: 通过语义不确定性建模和主动感知，显著提升了目标导航的效率和性能。

Abstract: Mobile robots exploring indoor environments increasingly rely on
vision-language models to perceive high-level semantic cues in camera images,
such as object categories. Such models offer the potential to substantially
advance robot behaviour for tasks such as object-goal navigation (ObjectNav),
where the robot must locate objects specified in natural language by exploring
the environment. Current ObjectNav methods heavily depend on prompt engineering
for perception and do not address the semantic uncertainty induced by
variations in prompt phrasing. Ignoring semantic uncertainty can lead to
suboptimal exploration, which in turn limits performance. Hence, we propose a
semantic uncertainty-informed active perception pipeline for ObjectNav in
indoor environments. We introduce a novel probabilistic sensor model for
quantifying semantic uncertainty in vision-language models and incorporate it
into a probabilistic geometric-semantic map to enhance spatial understanding.
Based on this map, we develop a frontier exploration planner with an
uncertainty-informed multi-armed bandit objective to guide efficient object
search. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves ObjectNav
success rates comparable to those of state-of-the-art approaches, without
requiring extensive prompt engineering.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of sensor extrinsic parameters for ground robotic
systems (i.e., relative poses) is crucial for ensuring spatial alignment and
achieving high-performance perception. However, existing calibration methods
typically require complex and often human-operated processes to collect data.
Moreover, most frameworks neglect acoustic sensors, thereby limiting the
associated systems' auditory perception capabilities. To alleviate these
issues, we propose an observability-aware active calibration method for ground
robots with multimodal sensors, including a microphone array, a LiDAR
(exteroceptive sensors), and wheel encoders (proprioceptive sensors). Unlike
traditional approaches, our method enables active trajectory optimization for
online data collection and calibration, contributing to the development of more
intelligent robotic systems. Specifically, we leverage the Fisher information
matrix (FIM) to quantify parameter observability and adopt its minimum
eigenvalue as an optimization metric for trajectory generation via B-spline
curves. Through planning and replanning of robot trajectory online, the method
enhances the observability of multi-sensor extrinsic parameters. The
effectiveness and advantages of our method have been demonstrated through
numerical simulations and real-world experiments. For the benefit of the
community, we have also open-sourced our code and data at

Motivation: 针对高维状态空间和复杂系统动力学下关节式车辆的运动规划问题，提出更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用延迟扩展运动基元（MPs）和A*启发式，结合监督学习训练神经网络预测代价，并改进目标到达策略。

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比之前方法，DE-AGT平均加速10倍。

Conclusion: DE-AGT算法显著提升了关节式车辆在复杂环境中的运动规划效率。

Abstract: Kinodynamic planning of articulated vehicles in cluttered environments faces
additional challenges arising from high-dimensional state space and complex
system dynamics. Built upon [1],[2], this work proposes the DE-AGT algorithm
that grows a tree using pre-computed motion primitives (MPs) and A* heuristics.
The first feature of DE-AGT is a delayed expansion of MPs. In particular, the
MPs are divided into different modes, which are ranked online. With the MP
classification and prioritization, DE-AGT expands the most promising mode of
MPs first, which eliminates unnecessary computation and finds solutions faster.
To obtain the cost-to-go heuristic for nonholonomic articulated vehicles, we
rely on supervised learning and train neural networks for fast and accurate
cost-to-go prediction. The learned heuristic is used for online mode ranking
and node selection. Another feature of DE-AGT is the improved goal-reaching.
Exactly reaching a goal state usually requires a constant connection checking
with the goal by solving steering problems -- non-trivial and time-consuming
for articulated vehicles. The proposed termination scheme overcomes this
challenge by tightly integrating a light-weight trajectory tracking controller
with the search process. DE-AGT is implemented for autonomous parking of a
general car-like tractor with 3-trailer. Simulation results show an average of
10x acceleration compared to a previous method.

Abstract: Vision-based robotic object grasping is typically investigated in the context
of isolated objects or unstructured object sets in bin picking scenarios.
However, there are several settings, such as construction or warehouse
automation, where a robot needs to interact with a structured object formation
such as a stack. In this context, we define the problem of selecting suitable
objects for grasping along with estimating an accurate 6DoF pose of these
objects. To address this problem, we propose a camera-IMU based approach that
prioritizes unobstructed objects on the higher layers of stacks and introduce a
dataset for benchmarking and evaluation, along with a suitable evaluation
metric that combines object selection with pose accuracy. Experimental results
show that although our method can perform quite well, this is a challenging
problem if a completely error-free solution is needed. Finally, we show results
from the deployment of our method for a brick-picking application in a
construction scenario.

Abstract: Dual-arm cooperative manipulation holds great promise for tackling complex
real-world tasks that demand seamless coordination and adaptive dynamics.
Despite substantial progress in learning-based motion planning, most approaches
struggle to generalize across diverse manipulation tasks and adapt to dynamic,
unstructured environments, particularly in scenarios involving interactions
between two objects such as assembly, tool use, and bimanual grasping. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel VLM-Assisted Siamese Flow
Diffusion (VLM-SFD) framework for efficient imitation learning in dual-arm
cooperative manipulation. The proposed VLM-SFD framework exhibits outstanding
adaptability, significantly enhancing the ability to rapidly adapt and
generalize to diverse real-world tasks from only a minimal number of human
demonstrations. Specifically, we propose a Siamese Flow Diffusion Network
(SFDNet) employs a dual-encoder-decoder Siamese architecture to embed two
target objects into a shared latent space, while a diffusion-based conditioning
process-conditioned by task instructions-generates two-stream object-centric
motion flows that guide dual-arm coordination. We further design a dynamic task
assignment strategy that seamlessly maps the predicted 2D motion flows into 3D
space and incorporates a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to adaptively
assign the optimal motion to each robotic arm over time. Experiments validate
the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to diverse manipulation tasks while maintaining high efficiency and
adaptability. The code and demo videos are publicly available on our project

Abstract: Many real-world applications require legged robots to be able to carry
variable payloads. Model-based controllers such as model predictive control
(MPC) have become the de facto standard in research for controlling these
systems. However, most model-based control architectures use fixed plant
models, which limits their applicability to different tasks. In this paper, we
present a Kalman filter (KF) formulation for online identification of the mass
and center of mass (COM) of a four-legged robot. We evaluate our method on a
quadrupedal robot carrying various payloads and find that it is more robust to
strong measurement noise than classical recursive least squares (RLS) methods.
Moreover, it improves the tracking performance of the model-based controller
with varying payloads when the model parameters are adjusted at runtime.

Abstract: The self-organization of robots for the formation of structures and shapes is
a stimulating application of the swarm robotic system. It involves a large
number of autonomous robots of heterogeneous behavior, coordination among them,
and their interaction with the dynamic environment. This process of complex
structure formation is considered a complex system, which needs to be modeled
by using any modeling approach. Although the formal specification approach
along with other formal methods has been used to model the behavior of robots
in a swarm. However, to the best of our knowledge, the formal specification
approach has not been used to model the self-organization process in swarm
robotic systems for shape formation. In this paper, we use a formal
specification approach to model the shape formation task of swarm robots. We
use Z (Zed) language of formal specification, which is a state-based language,
to model the states of the entities of the systems. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Z for the self-organized shape formation. The presented formal
specification model gives the outlines for designing and implementing the swarm
robotic system for the formation of complex shapes and structures. It also
provides the foundation for modeling the complex shape formation process for
swarm robotics using a multi-agent system in a simulation-based environment.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to augment a model-based control
method with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent and demonstrate a swing-up
maneuver with a suspended aerial manipulation platform. These platforms are
targeted towards a wide range of applications on construction sites involving
cranes, with swing-up maneuvers allowing it to perch at a given location,
inaccessible with purely the thrust force of the platform. Our proposed
approach is based on a hierarchical control framework, which allows different
tasks to be executed according to their assigned priorities. An RL agent is
then subsequently utilized to adjust the reference set-point of the
lower-priority tasks to perform the swing-up maneuver, which is confined in the
nullspace of the higher-priority tasks, such as maintaining a specific
orientation and position of the end-effector. Our approach is validated using
extensive numerical simulation studies.

Abstract: Imitation learning from large multi-task demonstration datasets has emerged
as a promising path for building generally-capable robots. As a result, 1000s
of hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the
globe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a
systematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the
utility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In
this work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this
question. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common
sources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object
types and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with
controlled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that
would be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical
settings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future
researchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should
current practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets
to maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study
yields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and
spatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection
and alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that
not only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval
strategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently
outperform existing training strategies by up to 70%. More results at

Abstract: This paper presents a disturbance-aware framework that embeds robustness into
minimum-lap-time trajectory optimization for motorsport. Two formulations are
introduced. (i) Open-loop, horizon-based covariance propagation uses worst-case
uncertainty growth over a finite window to tighten tire-friction and
track-limit constraints. (ii) Closed-loop, covariance-aware planning
incorporates a time-varying LQR feedback law in the optimizer, providing a
feedback-consistent estimate of disturbance attenuation and enabling sharper
yet reliable constraint tightening. Both methods yield reference trajectories
for human or artificial drivers: in autonomous applications the modelled
controller can replicate the on-board implementation, while for human driving
accuracy increases with the extent to which the driver can be approximated by
the assumed time-varying LQR policy. Computational tests on a representative
Barcelona-Catalunya sector show that both schemes meet the prescribed safety
probability, yet the closed-loop variant incurs smaller lap-time penalties than
the more conservative open-loop solution, while the nominal (non-robust)
trajectory remains infeasible under the same uncertainties. By accounting for
uncertainty growth and feedback action during planning, the proposed framework
delivers trajectories that are both performance-optimal and probabilistically
safe, advancing minimum-time optimization toward real-world deployment in
high-performance motorsport and autonomous racing.

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接操作潜在函数，实现了更高效的占用映射，并在区分自由与未知空间方面表现出色。

Abstract: Occupancy mapping has been a key enabler of mobile robotics. Originally based
on a discrete grid representation, occupancy mapping has evolved towards
continuous representations that can predict the occupancy status at any
location and account for occupancy correlations between neighbouring areas.
Gaussian Process (GP) approaches treat this task as a binary classification
problem using both observations of occupied and free space. Conceptually, a GP
latent field is passed through a logistic function to obtain the output class
without actually manipulating the GP latent field. In this work, we propose to
act directly on the latent function to efficiently integrate free space
information as a prior based on the shape of the sensor's field-of-view. A
major difference with existing methods is the change in the classification
problem, as we distinguish between free and unknown space. The `occupied' area
is the infinitesimally thin location where the class transitions from free to
unknown. We demonstrate in simulated environments that our approach is sound
and leads to competitive reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently made significant advance in
multi-task, end-to-end robotic control, due to the strong generalization
capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). A fundamental challenge in
developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with
the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly
fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers
from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and
heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level
semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical
space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models
anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve
alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state
estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model
to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting
performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in
low-data regimes.

Abstract: Shared control, which combines human expertise with autonomous assistance, is
critical for effective teleoperation in complex environments. While recent
advances in haptic-guided teleoperation have shown promise, they are often
limited to simplified tasks involving 6- or 7-DoF manipulators and rely on
separate control strategies for navigation and manipulation. This increases
both cognitive load and operational overhead. In this paper, we present a
unified tele-mobile manipulation framework that leverages haptic-guided shared
control. The system integrates a 9-DoF follower mobile manipulator and a 7-DoF
leader robotic arm, enabling seamless transitions between tele-navigation and
tele-manipulation through real-time haptic feedback. A user study with 20
participants under real-world conditions demonstrates that our framework
significantly improves task accuracy and efficiency without increasing
cognitive load. These findings highlight the potential of haptic-guided shared
control for enhancing operator performance in demanding teleoperation
scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a vital
research direction in robotics due to their impressive multimodal understanding
and generalization capabilities. Despite the progress, their practical
deployment is severely constrained by inference speed bottlenecks, particularly
in high-frequency and dexterous manipulation tasks. While recent studies have
explored Jacobi decoding as a more efficient alternative to traditional
autoregressive decoding, its practical benefits are marginal due to the lengthy
iterations. To address it, we introduce consistency distillation training to
predict multiple correct action tokens in each iteration, thereby achieving
acceleration. Besides, we design mixed-label supervision to mitigate the error
accumulation during distillation. Although distillation brings acceptable
speedup, we identify that certain inefficient iterations remain a critical
bottleneck. To tackle this, we propose an early-exit decoding strategy that
moderately relaxes convergence conditions, which further improves average
inference efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method
achieves more than 4 times inference acceleration across different baselines
while maintaining high task success rates in both simulated and real-world
robot tasks. These experiments validate that our approach provides an efficient
and general paradigm for accelerating multimodal decision-making in robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型依赖低层控制器，限制了动态任务的表现，尤其是人形机器人的全身控制任务。

Method: 提出LeVERB框架，包括高层视觉-语言策略学习潜在动作词汇和低层强化学习策略生成动态命令。

Conclusion: LeVERB填补了视觉-语言-动作模型在人形机器人全身控制领域的空白，展示了显著的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong semantic
understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet most existing systems assume an
accurate low-level controller with hand-crafted action "vocabulary" such as
end-effector pose or root velocity. This assumption confines prior work to
quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by
humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature,
we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language,
closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10
categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot
Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid
vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language
policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic
demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes
these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark,
LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation
tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical
whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.

Abstract: Neighborhood finders and nearest neighbor queries are fundamental parts of
sampling based motion planning algorithms. Using different distance metrics or
otherwise changing the definition of a neighborhood produces different
algorithms with unique empiric and theoretical properties. In \cite{l-pa-06}
LaValle suggests a neighborhood finder for the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree
RRT
  algorithm \cite{l-rrtnt-98} which finds the nearest neighbor of the sampled
point on the swath of the tree, that is on the set of all of the points on the
tree edges, using a hierarchical data structure. In this paper we implement
such a neighborhood finder and show, theoretically and experimentally, that
this results in more efficient algorithms, and suggest a variant of the
Rapidly-exploring Random Graph RRG algorithm \cite{f-isaom-10} that better
exploits the exploration properties of the newly described subroutine for
finding narrow passages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在高层次规划中表现出色，但在低层机器人控制预测上因缺乏物理世界理解而受限。

Result: 在多样化复杂操作任务中验证了方法的优越性，性能优于基于VLM的基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合数字孪生与VLM的框架显著提升了开放世界机器人操作的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in open-world robot manipulation have been largely driven
by vision-language models (VLMs). While these models exhibit strong
generalization ability in high-level planning, they struggle to predict
low-level robot controls due to limited physical-world understanding. To
address this issue, we propose a model predictive control framework for
open-world manipulation that combines the semantic reasoning capabilities of
VLMs with physically-grounded, interactive digital twins of the real-world
environments. By constructing and simulating the digital twins, our approach
generates feasible motion trajectories, simulates corresponding outcomes, and
prompts the VLM with future observations to evaluate and select the most
suitable outcome based on language instructions of the task. To further enhance
the capability of pre-trained VLMs in understanding complex scenes for robotic
control, we leverage the flexible rendering capabilities of the digital twin to
synthesize the scene at various novel, unoccluded viewpoints. We validate our
approach on a diverse set of complex manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior
performance compared to baseline methods for language-conditioned robotic
control using VLMs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ViTaL框架通过分阶段解决精细操作任务，结合视觉语言模型和触觉感知，实现了在未见环境中的高成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法在精确操作上表现不佳，模仿学习需要大量演示，而强化学习策略脆弱且难以泛化。

Method: ViTál将任务分解为定位阶段（使用视觉语言模型）和局部交互阶段（使用可重用的触觉感知策略）。

Result: ViTaL在未见环境中实现了约90%的成功率，且对干扰物具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ViTaL通过结合视觉和触觉感知，实现了可泛化的低层技能，并与高层视觉语言模型良好集成。

Abstract: Data-driven approaches struggle with precise manipulation; imitation learning
requires many hard-to-obtain demonstrations, while reinforcement learning
yields brittle, non-generalizable policies. We introduce VisuoTactile Local
(ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation
tasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a
vision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the
object of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable,
scene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric
vision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that
while scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across
task instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they
can generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90%
success on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to
distractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1)
foundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via
behavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies
learned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts
performance in contact-rich tasks. Ablation studies validate each of these
insights, and we demonstrate that ViTaL integrates well with high-level VLMs,
enabling robust, reusable low-level skills. Results and videos are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对视频合成孔径雷达（Video SAR）中多目标跟踪问题的解决方案，包括数据集VSMB和两种新机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频SAR中目标运动引起的多普勒频移会产生伪影，容易被误认为是静态遮挡的阴影，同时目标外观变化可能导致关联失败和轨迹中断。缺乏公开基准数据集也是该领域的主要限制。

Method: 收集并标注了45个视频SAR序列（VSMB数据集），提出线特征增强机制和运动感知线索丢弃机制，以减少伪影和外观变化的影响。

Result: 所提模型在VSMB上达到最先进性能，数据集和模型已开源。

Conclusion: 论文通过新数据集和机制有效解决了视频SAR中的多目标跟踪问题，提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: In the context of multi-object tracking using video synthetic aperture radar
(Video SAR), Doppler shifts induced by target motion result in artifacts that
are easily mistaken for shadows caused by static occlusions. Moreover,
appearance changes of the target caused by Doppler mismatch may lead to
association failures and disrupt trajectory continuity. A major limitation in
this field is the lack of public benchmark datasets for standardized algorithm
evaluation. To address the above challenges, we collected and annotated 45
video SAR sequences containing moving targets, and named the Video SAR MOT
Benchmark (VSMB). Specifically, to mitigate the effects of trailing and
defocusing in moving targets, we introduce a line feature enhancement mechanism
that emphasizes the positive role of motion shadows and reduces false alarms
induced by static occlusions. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of
target appearance variations, we propose a motion-aware clue discarding
mechanism that substantially improves tracking robustness in Video SAR. The
proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VSMB, and the
dataset and model are released at https://github.com/softwarePupil/VSMB.

TL;DR: BreastDCEDL是一个深度学习数据集，包含2070名乳腺癌患者的3D DCE-MRI扫描数据，用于早期检测和治疗监测。基于该数据集开发的ViT模型在pCR预测中表现优异（AUC 0.94）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌早期检测和治疗监测需求迫切，但缺乏公开的多中心数据集限制了深度学习在DCE-MRI分析中的应用。

Method: 数据集整合了I-SPY1、I-SPY2和Duke队列的DCE-MRI数据，转换为标准化NIfTI格式，并开发了基于ViT的模型进行pCR预测。

Result: ViT模型在HR+/HER2-患者中实现了pCR预测的AUC 0.94和准确率0.93。

Conclusion: BreastDCEDL填补了公开数据集的空白，支持乳腺癌影像的临床建模和可重复研究。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide,
making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical
priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset
comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from
2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts,
all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were
rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal
integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical
metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR),
and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and
deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data,
progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets.
BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models,
including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial
training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed
the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast
phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT
model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2-
patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark
splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically
meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSTA提出了一种多模态历史适配器，用于文本到图像扩散模型，通过历史特征提取和适配器生成连贯的图像序列，解决了现有方法的训练和适应性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成连贯图像序列时，要么需要大量训练，要么缺乏对叙事提示的适应性。ViSTA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ViSTA包括多模态历史融合模块和历史适配器，并引入显著历史选择策略和TIFA评估指标。

Result: 在StorySalon和FlintStonesSV数据集上，ViSTA生成的图像序列一致且与文本描述对齐良好。

Conclusion: ViSTA通过多模态历史适配器和显著历史选择策略，有效提升了视觉叙事的连贯性和适应性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, yet
generating coherent image sequences for visual storytelling remains
challenging. A key challenge is effectively leveraging all previous text-image
pairs, referred to as history text-image pairs, which provide contextual
information for maintaining consistency across frames. Existing auto-regressive
methods condition on all past image-text pairs but require extensive training,
while training-free subject-specific approaches ensure consistency but lack
adaptability to narrative prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a
multi-modal history adapter for text-to-image diffusion models, \textbf{ViSTA}.
It consists of (1) a multi-modal history fusion module to extract relevant
history features and (2) a history adapter to condition the generation on the
extracted relevant features. We also introduce a salient history selection
strategy during inference, where the most salient history text-image pair is
selected, improving the quality of the conditioning. Furthermore, we propose to
employ a Visual Question Answering-based metric TIFA to assess text-image
alignment in visual storytelling, providing a more targeted and interpretable
assessment of generated images. Evaluated on the StorySalon and FlintStonesSV
dataset, our proposed ViSTA model is not only consistent across different
frames, but also well-aligned with the narrative text descriptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN和Transformer模型在复杂细胞和组织结构分割中表现不佳，且依赖大数据集和高计算成本。

Method: 结合Inception深度卷积和Mamba块，利用多阶段特征和语义线索处理模糊边界，实现高效分割。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，计算成本降低约5倍。

Conclusion: InceptionMamba在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于医学图像分割。

Abstract: Accurate microscopic medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in
diagnosing various cancerous cells and identifying tumors. Driven by
advancements in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformer-based models have been extensively studied to enhance receptive
fields and improve medical image segmentation task. However, they often
struggle to capture complex cellular and tissue structures in challenging
scenarios such as background clutter and object overlap. Moreover, their
reliance on the availability of large datasets for improved performance, along
with the high computational cost, limit their practicality. To address these
issues, we propose an efficient framework for the segmentation task, named
InceptionMamba, which encodes multi-stage rich features and offers both
performance and computational efficiency. Specifically, we exploit semantic
cues to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency regions to enrich the
multi-stage features to handle the blurred region boundaries (e.g., cell
boundaries). These enriched features are input to a hybrid model that combines
an Inception depth-wise convolution with a Mamba block, to maintain high
efficiency and capture inherent variations in the scales and shapes of the
regions of interest. These enriched features along with low-resolution features
are fused to get the final segmentation mask. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two challenging microscopic segmentation
datasets (SegPC21 and GlaS) and two skin lesion segmentation datasets (ISIC2017
and ISIC2018), while reducing computational cost by about 5 times compared to
the previous best performing method.

Abstract: We present a CLIP-based, multi-modal, multi-label classifier for predicting
geographical context tags from landscape photos in the Geograph dataset--a
crowdsourced image archive spanning the British Isles, including remote regions
lacking POIs and street-level imagery. Our approach addresses a Kaggle
competition\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-geographic-context-from-landscape-photos}
task based on a subset of Geograph's 8M images, with strict evaluation: exact
match accuracy is required across 49 possible tags. We show that combining
location and title embeddings with image features improves accuracy over using
image embeddings alone. We release a lightweight
pipeline\footnote{https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/ClipTheLandscape} that trains
on a modest laptop, using pre-trained CLIP image and text embeddings and a
simple classification head. Predicted tags can support downstream tasks such as
building location embedders for GeoAI applications, enriching spatial
understanding in data-sparse regions.

Conclusion: MLLMs在场景理解中具有潜力，但需优化小模型和集成方法以提升一致性表现。

Abstract: Scene understanding is critical for various downstream tasks in autonomous
driving, including facilitating driver-agent communication and enhancing
human-centered explainability of autonomous vehicle (AV) decisions. This paper
evaluates the capability of four multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
including relatively small models, to understand scenes in a zero-shot,
in-context learning setting. Additionally, we explore whether combining these
models using an ensemble approach with majority voting can enhance scene
understanding performance. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o, the largest
model, outperforms the others in scene understanding. However, the performance
gap between GPT-4o and the smaller models is relatively modest, suggesting that
advanced techniques such as improved in-context learning, retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), or fine-tuning could further optimize the smaller models'
performance. We also observe mixed results with the ensemble approach: while
some scene attributes show improvement in performance metrics such as F1-score,
others experience a decline. These findings highlight the need for more
sophisticated ensemble techniques to achieve consistent gains across all scene
attributes. This study underscores the potential of leveraging MLLMs for scene
understanding and provides insights into optimizing their performance for
autonomous driving applications.

Result: 实验表明，该方法减少了72%的标记数量，推理速度提升50%，同时保持了运动规划精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶策略的高效实现提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end
robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their
scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for
generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to
ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware.
To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization
strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and
rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input
cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry
around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art
neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over
current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer
tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same
open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop
driving simulations.

Conclusion: 第一人称视角视频对穿戴者隐私构成显著威胁，需进一步研究防护措施。

Abstract: While the rapid proliferation of wearable cameras has raised significant
concerns about egocentric video privacy, prior work has largely overlooked the
unique privacy threats posed to the camera wearer. This work investigates the
core question: How much privacy information about the camera wearer can be
inferred from their first-person view videos? We introduce EgoPrivacy, the
first large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of privacy risks
in egocentric vision. EgoPrivacy covers three types of privacy (demographic,
individual, and situational), defining seven tasks that aim to recover private
information ranging from fine-grained (e.g., wearer's identity) to
coarse-grained (e.g., age group). To further emphasize the privacy threats
inherent to egocentric vision, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Attack, a novel
attack strategy that leverages ego-to-exo retrieval from an external pool of
exocentric videos to boost the effectiveness of demographic privacy attacks. An
extensive comparison of the different attacks possible under all threat models
is presented, showing that private information of the wearer is highly
susceptible to leakage. For instance, our findings indicate that foundation
models can effectively compromise wearer privacy even in zero-shot settings by
recovering attributes such as identity, scene, gender, and race with 70-80%
accuracy. Our code and data are available at

MatchPlant, a modular, graphical user interface-supported, open-source Python
pipeline for UAV-based single-plant detection and geospatial trait extraction.
MatchPlant enables end-to-end workflows by integrating UAV image processing,
user-guided annotation, Convolutional Neural Network model training for object
detection, forward projection of bounding boxes onto an orthomosaic, and
shapefile generation for spatial phenotypic analysis. In an early-season maize
case study, MatchPlant achieved reliable detection performance (validation AP:
89.6%, test AP: 85.9%) and effectively projected bounding boxes, covering 89.8%
of manually annotated boxes with 87.5% of projections achieving an Intersection
over Union (IoU) greater than 0.5. Trait values extracted from predicted
bounding instances showed high agreement with manual annotations (r =
0.87-0.97, IoU >= 0.4). Detection outputs were reused across time points to
extract plant height and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with minimal
additional annotation, facilitating efficient temporal phenotyping. By
combining modular design, reproducibility, and geospatial precision, MatchPlant
offers a scalable framework for UAV-based plant-level analysis with broad

Conclusion: SEED的硬件感知设计在神经形态处理器上实现了高效、低延迟的处理，为事件相机目标检测树立了新标杆。

Abstract: Leveraging the high temporal resolution and dynamic range, object detection
with event cameras can enhance the performance and safety of automotive and
robotics applications in real-world scenarios. However, processing sparse event
data requires compute-intensive convolutional recurrent units, complicating
their integration into resource-constrained edge applications. Here, we propose
the Sparse Event-based Efficient Detector (SEED) for efficient event-based
object detection on neuromorphic processors. We introduce sparse convolutional
recurrent learning, which achieves over 92% activation sparsity in recurrent
processing, vastly reducing the cost for spatiotemporal reasoning on sparse
event data. We validated our method on Prophesee's 1 Mpx and Gen1 event-based
object detection datasets. Notably, SEED sets a new benchmark in computational
efficiency for event-based object detection which requires long-term temporal
learning. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, SEED significantly reduces
synaptic operations while delivering higher or same-level mAP. Our hardware
simulations showcase the critical role of SEED's hardware-aware design in
achieving energy-efficient and low-latency neuromorphic processing.

Result: 生成的图像临床质量显著提升，诊断任务准确率在20类皮肤病分类中提高9.02%，少样本场景下提高13.89%。

Conclusion: MAGIC框架有效结合专家知识与AI，生成高质量医学图像，提升诊断模型性能。

Abstract: Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML
models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a
small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been
considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and
augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images,
deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for
synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when
data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for
incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand
labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities,
making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel
framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through
AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease
images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined
criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly
improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload.
Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality
of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist
assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized
images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition
skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.

TL;DR: UniDet-D是一个统一框架，用于解决多种恶劣天气条件下的目标检测问题，结合动态光谱注意力机制，提升特征表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的目标检测常受恶劣天气影响，现有方法局限于单一天气类型且泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出UniDet-D框架，结合动态光谱注意力机制，自适应强调信息光谱成分，抑制无关部分。

Result: 实验表明UniDet-D在多种恶劣天气条件下表现优异，且对未见过的新天气条件（如沙尘暴）具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniDet-D在恶劣天气目标检测中表现出色，具备实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Real-world object detection is a challenging task where the captured
images/videos often suffer from complex degradations due to various adverse
weather conditions such as rain, fog, snow, low-light, etc. Despite extensive
prior efforts, most existing methods are designed for one specific type of
adverse weather with constraints of poor generalization, under-utilization of
visual features while handling various image degradations. Leveraging a
theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather
images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of
object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object
detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the
proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that
adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing
irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation
across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D
achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather
degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards
unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures,
highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理IoT设备采集的损坏图像数据时鲁棒性不足，且计算和传输资源消耗高。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，准确率提升2.86%，训练速度提升53%。

Conclusion: GroupNL在提升模型鲁棒性和训练效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: It has become mainstream to deploy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models
on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the help of the cloud to
provide users with a variety of high-quality services. Most existing methods
have two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data
collected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and
transmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear
transformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature
maps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to
improve the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution
filters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small
set of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on
vanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several
groups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse
feature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively
reduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training
by setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not
updating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by
using NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated
based on sliding windows. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-10-C,
Icons50, and ImageNet-1K datasets in NVIDIA RTX GPU platforms show that the
proposed GroupNL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in model robust and
training acceleration. Specifically, on the Icons-50 dataset, the accuracy of
GroupNL-ResNet-18 achieves approximately 2.86% higher than the vanilla
ResNet-18. GroupNL improves training speed by about 53% compared to vanilla CNN
when trained on a cluster of 8 NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

TL;DR: Trust-videoLLMs是一个评估视频多模态大语言模型（videoLLMs）可信度的综合基准，涵盖真实性、安全性、鲁棒性、公平性和隐私五个维度。研究发现现有模型在动态视觉场景理解和跨模态扰动恢复方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管videoLLMs在多模态视频理解方面取得进展，但其可信度问题（如事实错误、有害内容、偏见、幻觉和隐私风险）限制了可靠性。

Method: 研究提出Trust-videoLLMs基准，包含30个任务，通过合成、标注和改编视频评估动态视觉场景和跨模态交互。评估了23个先进模型（5个商业，18个开源）。

Result: 开源模型在真实性上偶尔优于商业模型，但整体可信度较低。数据多样性比规模效应更重要。模型在动态视觉理解和跨模态扰动恢复方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要改进安全对齐以提升模型能力。Trust-videoLLMs为标准化可信度评估提供了公开可扩展的工具箱。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models for video
understanding (videoLLMs) have improved their ability to process dynamic
multimodal data. However, trustworthiness challenges factual inaccuracies,
harmful content, biases, hallucinations, and privacy risks, undermine
reliability due to video data's spatiotemporal complexities. This study
introduces Trust-videoLLMs, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating videoLLMs
across five dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and
privacy. Comprising 30 tasks with adapted, synthetic, and annotated videos, the
framework assesses dynamic visual scenarios, cross-modal interactions, and
real-world safety concerns. Our evaluation of 23 state-of-the-art videoLLMs (5
commercial,18 open-source) reveals significant limitations in dynamic visual
scene understanding and cross-modal perturbation resilience. Open-source
videoLLMs show occasional truthfulness advantages but inferior overall
credibility compared to commercial models, with data diversity outperforming
scale effects. These findings highlight the need for advanced safety alignment
to enhance capabilities. Trust-videoLLMs provides a publicly available,
extensible toolbox for standardized trustworthiness assessments, bridging the
gap between accuracy-focused benchmarks and critical demands for robustness,
safety, fairness, and privacy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的成员推理攻击方法（ICIMIA），通过图像损坏的敏感性差异检测训练数据中的隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在训练数据中可能包含敏感信息，存在隐私风险，因此需要检测图像是否用于训练。

Method: 设计了基于图像损坏的成员推理攻击（ICIMIA），利用成员与非成员图像对损坏的敏感性差异，分别在白盒和黑盒设置下进行攻击。

Result: 实验验证了所提方法在白盒和黑盒场景下的有效性。

Conclusion: ICIMIA方法简单有效，能够检测LVLMs训练数据中的隐私风险。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance in many downstream tasks. However, LVLMs are trained on large-scale
datasets, which can pose privacy risks if training images contain sensitive
information. Therefore, it is important to detect whether an image is used to
train the LVLM. Recent studies have investigated membership inference attacks
(MIAs) against LVLMs, including detecting image-text pairs and single-modality
content. In this work, we focus on detecting whether a target image is used to
train the target LVLM. We design simple yet effective Image Corruption-Inspired
Membership Inference Attacks (ICIMIA) against LLVLMs, which are inspired by
LVLM's different sensitivity to image corruption for member and non-member
images. We first perform an MIA method under the white-box setting, where we
can obtain the embeddings of the image through the vision part of the target
LVLM. The attacks are based on the embedding similarity between the image and
its corrupted version. We further explore a more practical scenario where we
have no knowledge about target LVLMs and we can only query the target LVLMs
with an image and a question. We then conduct the attack by utilizing the
output text embeddings' similarity. Experiments on existing datasets validate
the effectiveness of our proposed attack methods under those two different
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CIL中现有PEFT方法在参数效率和模型灵活性上的不足。

Method: 通过IPR评估参数重要性并选择性约束更新，结合TSDC补偿语义漂移以优化分类器。

Result: 在五个CIL基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EKPC方法在保留知识和适应新任务上取得了平衡，性能优越。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to enable AI models to continuously
learn from sequentially arriving data of different classes over time while
retaining previously acquired knowledge. Recently, Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like prompt pool-based approaches and adapter
tuning, have shown great attraction in CIL. However, these methods either
introduce additional parameters that increase memory usage, or rely on rigid
regularization techniques which reduce forgetting but compromise model
flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Elastic Knowledge
Preservation and Compensation (EKPC) method, integrating Importance-aware
Parameter Regularization (IPR) and Trainable Semantic Drift Compensation (TSDC)
for CIL. Specifically, the IPR method assesses the sensitivity of network
parameters to prior tasks using a novel parameter-importance algorithm. It then
selectively constrains updates within the shared adapter according to these
importance values, thereby preserving previously acquired knowledge while
maintaining the model's flexibility. However, it still exhibits slight semantic
differences in previous knowledge to accommodate new incremental tasks, leading
to decision boundaries confusion in classifier. To eliminate this confusion,
TSDC trains a unified classifier by compensating prototypes with trainable
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performances to existing
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用音频信息增强视频测试时适应（TTA）性能的新方法，通过音频辅助伪标签和灵活的自适应循环提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频TTA方法主要依赖视觉信号，忽略了音频数据的潜在贡献。本文旨在填补这一空白，利用音频语义信息提升视频TTA性能。

Method: 提出音频辅助伪标签生成方法，通过预训练音频模型分类音频信号，并利用大语言模型将音频预测映射到视频标签空间。同时设计了灵活的自适应循环，根据损失和一致性变化动态调整迭代次数。

Result: 在多个数据集（包括新构建的音频-视频TTA数据集）上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了视频分类模型的适应性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将音频信息整合到视频TTA中，为多模态TTA研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to boost the generalization capability of a
trained model by conducting self-/unsupervised learning during the testing
phase. While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual
supervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent
audio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates
audio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic
content of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the
context of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping
method by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals
extracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video
label spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection
between the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the
generated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines
the optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes
in loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized
adaptation process for each sample. Experimental results on two widely used
datasets (UCF101-C and Kinetics-Sounds-C), as well as on two newly constructed
audio-video TTA datasets (AVE-C and AVMIT-C) with various corruption types,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method consistently improves
adaptation performance across different video classification models and
represents a significant step forward in integrating audio information into
video TTA. Code: https://github.com/keikeiqi/Audio-Assisted-TTA.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is crucial in medical imaging to ensure
reliable diagnosis and effective treatment planning. This study introduces a
novel double ensembling framework that synergistically combines pre-trained
deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction with optimized machine
learning (ML) classifiers for robust classification. The framework incorporates
comprehensive preprocessing and data augmentation of brain magnetic resonance
images (MRI), followed by deep feature extraction using transfer learning with
pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) networks. The novelty lies in the
dual-level ensembling strategy: feature-level ensembling, which integrates deep
features from the top-performing ViT models, and classifier-level ensembling,
which aggregates predictions from hyperparameter-optimized ML classifiers.
Experiments on two public Kaggle MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrate that this
approach significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the
importance of feature and classifier fusion. The proposed methodology also
highlights the critical roles of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and advanced
preprocessing techniques in improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability,
advancing the integration of DL and ML for clinically relevant medical image
analysis.

Abstract: The advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has significantly
reduced the computational burden of adapting large-scale pretrained models to
diverse downstream tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle to
achieve robust performance under domain shifts while maintaining computational
efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Low-rAnk Regulated Gradient
Projection (LARGO) algorithm that integrates dynamic constraints into low-rank
adaptation methods. Specifically, LARGO incorporates parallel trainable
gradient projections to dynamically regulate layer-wise updates, retaining the
Out-Of-Distribution robustness of pretrained model while preserving inter-layer
independence. Additionally, it ensures computational efficiency by mitigating
the influence of gradient dependencies across layers during weight updates.
Besides, through leveraging singular value decomposition of pretrained weights
for structured initialization, we incorporate an SVD-based initialization
strategy that minimizing deviation from pretrained knowledge. Through extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks, LARGO achieves state-of-the-art performance
across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating improved
robustness under domain shifts with significantly lower computational overhead
compared to existing PEFT methods. The source code will be released soon.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel
view synthesis. However, existing methods struggle to adaptively optimize the
distribution of Gaussian primitives based on scene characteristics, making it
challenging to balance reconstruction quality and efficiency. Inspired by human
perception, we propose scene-adaptive perceptual densification for Gaussian
Splatting (Perceptual-GS), a novel framework that integrates perceptual
sensitivity into the 3DGS training process to address this challenge. We first
introduce a perception-aware representation that models human visual
sensitivity while constraining the number of Gaussian primitives. Building on
this foundation, we develop a \cameraready{perceptual sensitivity-adaptive
distribution} to allocate finer Gaussian granularity to visually critical
regions, enhancing reconstruction quality and robustness. Extensive evaluations
on multiple datasets, including BungeeNeRF for large-scale scenes, demonstrate
that Perceptual-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction
quality, efficiency, and robustness. The code is publicly available at:

Result: 在多个VPR基准数据集上，LGCN在定位精度和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGCN通过结合CNN和ViT的优势，显著提升了VPR任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) plays a crucial role in robotic localization
and navigation. The key challenge lies in constructing feature representations
that are robust to environmental changes. Existing methods typically adopt
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision Transformers (ViTs) as feature
extractors. However, these architectures excel in different aspects -- CNNs are
effective at capturing local details. At the same time, ViTs are better suited
for modeling global context, making it difficult to leverage the strengths of
both. To address this issue, we propose a local-global feature complementation
network (LGCN) for VPR which integrates a parallel CNN-ViT hybrid architecture
with a dynamic feature fusion module (DFM). The DFM performs dynamic feature
fusion through joint modeling of spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Furthermore, to enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of the ViT branch
for VPR tasks, we introduce lightweight frequency-to-spatial fusion adapters
into the frozen ViT backbone. These adapters enable task-specific adaptation
with controlled parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple VPR
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed LGCN consistently outperforms
existing approaches in terms of localization accuracy and robustness,
validating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现最佳，内存消耗减少89.1%。

Conclusion: ZO优化在VLCL中具有潜力，选择性应用和层间优化策略是关键。

Abstract: Continual learning in vision-language models (VLMs) faces critical challenges
in balancing parameter efficiency, memory consumption, and optimization
stability. While First-Order (FO) optimization (e.g., SGD) dominate current
approaches, their deterministic gradients often trap models in suboptimal local
minima and incur substantial memory overhead. This paper pioneers a systematic
exploration of Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization for vision-language continual
learning (VLCL). We first identify the incompatibility of naive full-ZO
adoption in VLCL due to modality-specific instability. To resolve this, we
selectively applying ZO to either vision or language modalities while retaining
FO in the complementary branch. Furthermore, we develop a layer-wise
optimization paradigm that interleaves ZO and FO across network layers,
capitalizing on the heterogeneous learning dynamics of shallow versus deep
representations. A key theoretical insight reveals that ZO perturbations in
vision branches exhibit higher variance than language counterparts, prompting a
gradient sign normalization mechanism with modality-specific perturbation
constraints. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing memory consumption by
89.1% compared to baselines. Code will be available upon publication.

Conclusion: DG-ReID领域仍有未解决问题，未来研究需进一步探索。

Abstract: Person Re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same
individual captured across non-overlapping camera views, making it a critical
component of intelligent surveillance systems. Traditional ReID methods assume
that the training and test domains share similar characteristics and primarily
focus on learning discriminative features within a given domain. However, they
often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to domain shifts caused by
variations in viewpoint, background, and lighting conditions. To address this
issue, Domain-Adaptive ReID (DA-ReID) methods have been proposed. These
approaches incorporate unlabeled target domain data during training and improve
performance by aligning feature distributions between source and target
domains. Domain-Generalizable ReID (DG-ReID) tackles a more realistic and
challenging setting by aiming to learn domain-invariant features without
relying on any target domain data. Recent methods have explored various
strategies to enhance generalization across diverse environments, but the field
remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
survey of DG-ReID. We first review the architectural components of DG-ReID
including the overall setting, commonly used backbone networks and multi-source
input configurations. Then, we categorize and analyze domain generalization
modules that explicitly aim to learn domain-invariant and
identity-discriminative representations. To examine the broader applicability
of these techniques, we further conduct a case study on a related task that
also involves distribution shifts. Finally, we discuss recent trends, open
challenges, and promising directions for future research in DG-ReID. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic survey dedicated to
DG-ReID.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的推理时细化框架，用于提升事件式眼动追踪模型的输出质量，无需修改模型架构或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件式眼动追踪在认知状态推断中具有高时间分辨率和抗运动伪影的优势，但现有模型的输出存在噪声和不连续性，影响下游任务。

Method: 方法包括两个后处理模块：运动感知中值滤波（抑制眨眼引起的噪声）和基于光流的局部细化（减少空间抖动和时间不连续性）。同时提出了一种新的抖动度量标准。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基线模型上显著提升了事件式眼动信号的一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为事件式眼动追踪在微表情分析和心理状态解码等下游任务中的应用提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive
state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion
artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as
attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic,
inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing
event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or
requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i)
Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while
preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement,
which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial
jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy
metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness
of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal
complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency
of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks
such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on
controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with
multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在严重犯罪（如性侵）中，手部图像可能是唯一可用的识别证据，因此需要一种高效且准确的识别方法。

Method: 提出CLIP-HandID方法，利用CLIP模型，通过文本提示学习手部图像的深度特征表示，并使用伪标记增强多模态推理能力。

Result: 在两个大型公开手部数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-HandID为刑事调查中的人员识别提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，尤其在缺乏其他证据的情况下表现突出。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to person identification based on hand
images, designed specifically for criminal investigations. The method is
particularly valuable in serious crimes like sexual abuse, where hand images
are often the sole identifiable evidence available. Our proposed method,
CLIP-HandID, leverages pre-trained foundational vision-language model,
particularly CLIP, to efficiently learn discriminative deep feature
representations from hand images given as input to the image encoder of CLIP
using textual prompts as semantic guidance. We propose to learn pseudo-tokens
that represent specific visual contexts or appearance attributes using textual
inversion network since labels of hand images are indexes instead text
descriptions. The learned pseudo-tokens are incorporated into textual prompts
which are given as input to the text encoder of the CLIP to leverage its
multi-modal reasoning to enhance its generalization for identification. Through
extensive evaluations on two large, publicly available hand datasets with
multi-ethnic representation, we show that our method substantially surpasses
existing approaches.

Abstract: This study presents a novel demographics informed deep learning framework
designed to forecast urban spatial transformations by jointly modeling
geographic satellite imagery, socio-demographics, and travel behavior dynamics.
The proposed model employs an encoder-decoder architecture with temporal gated
residual connections, integrating satellite imagery and demographic data to
accurately forecast future spatial transformations. The study also introduces a
demographics prediction component which ensures that predicted satellite
imagery are consistent with demographic features, significantly enhancing
physiological realism and socioeconomic accuracy. The framework is enhanced by
a proposed multi-objective loss function complemented by a semantic loss
function that balances visual realism with temporal coherence. The experimental
results from this study demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
model compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving higher structural
similarity (SSIM: 0.8342) and significantly improved demographic consistency
(Demo-loss: 0.14 versus 0.95 and 0.96 for baseline models). Additionally, the
study validates co-evolutionary theories of urban development, demonstrating
quantifiable bidirectional influences between built environment characteristics
and population patterns. The study also contributes a comprehensive multimodal
dataset pairing satellite imagery sequences (2012-2023) with corresponding
demographic and travel behavior attributes, addressing existing gaps in urban
and transportation planning resources by explicitly connecting physical
landscape evolution with socio-demographic patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的数据可视化效果不佳，需要人工干预改进，因此需要一种自动化批评工具。

Method: 构建高质量可视化批评数据集，结合人类创建和LLM生成的可视化实例，并利用小型开源MLLM模型进行自动评估。

Result: 实验表明，小型MLLM模型通过高质量批评数据集，性能接近更大或专有模型。

Conclusion: VIS-Shepherd展示了MLLM在自动化可视化批评中的潜力，为改进LLM生成可视化提供了方向。

Abstract: Data visualization generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
promising results but often produces suboptimal visualizations that require
human intervention for improvement. In this work, we introduce VIS-Shepherd, a
specialized Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based critic to evaluate and
provide feedback for LLM-generated data visualizations. At the core of our
approach is a framework to construct a high-quality visualization critique
dataset, where we collect human-created visualization instances, synthesize
corresponding LLM-generated instances, and construct high-quality critiques. We
conduct both model-based automatic evaluation and human preference studies to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our experiments show that even
small (7B parameters) open-source MLLM models achieve substantial performance
gains by leveraging our high-quality visualization critique dataset, reaching
levels comparable to much larger open-source or even proprietary models. Our
work demonstrates significant potential for MLLM-based automated visualization
critique and indicates promising directions for enhancing LLM-based data

*Hao Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决图像边缘检测中训练与推理不一致的方法，通过设计Binarization-Aware Adjuster（BAA）显式地将二值化行为纳入梯度优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练与推理之间的不匹配（连续输出与二值预测）削弱了学习目标与实际任务性能的联系。

Method: 提出基于Distance Weight Function（DWF）的损失调整机制，重新加权像素贡献，并引入自适应阈值估计方法。

Result: 在多种架构和数据集上的实验验证了BAA的有效性。

Conclusion: BAA为结构化预测任务中连续优化与离散评估之间的差距提供了一种通用解决方案。

Abstract: Image edge detection (ED) faces a fundamental mismatch between training and
inference: models are trained using continuous-valued outputs but evaluated
using binary predictions. This misalignment, caused by the
non-differentiability of binarization, weakens the link between learning
objectives and actual task performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical
method to design a Binarization-Aware Adjuster (BAA), which explicitly
incorporates binarization behavior into gradient-based optimization. At the
core of BAA is a novel loss adjustment mechanism based on a Distance Weight
Function (DWF), which reweights pixel-wise contributions according to their
correctness and proximity to the decision boundary. This emphasizes
decision-critical regions while down-weighting less influential ones. We also
introduce a self-adaptive procedure to estimate the optimal binarization
threshold for BAA, further aligning training dynamics with inference behavior.
Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Beyond ED, BAA offers a generalizable strategy
for bridging the gap between continuous optimization and discrete evaluation in
structured prediction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同深度学习模型在高血压视网膜病变检测中的表现，以及数据增强对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用自定义CNN、预训练的Transformer模型和AutoML解决方案进行实验，分析数据增强对不同架构的影响。

Result: 数据增强显著提升纯ViT性能，但对混合ViT-CNN模型有负面影响；小patch尺寸的ViT表现更优；DINOv2需数据增强才能发挥潜力。

Conclusion: 模型架构、数据增强和数据集大小对医学图像分类有重要影响，需根据模型特性选择合适策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of deep learning strategies for
detecting hypertensive retinopathy from fundus images, a central task in the
HRDC challenge~\cite{qian2025hrdc}. We investigate three distinct approaches: a
custom CNN, a suite of pre-trained transformer-based models, and an AutoML
solution. Our findings reveal a stark, architecture-dependent response to data
augmentation. Augmentation significantly boosts the performance of pure Vision
Transformers (ViTs), which we hypothesize is due to their weaker inductive
biases, forcing them to learn robust spatial and structural features.
Conversely, the same augmentation strategy degrades the performance of hybrid
ViT-CNN models, whose stronger, pre-existing biases from the CNN component may
be "confused" by the transformations. We show that smaller patch sizes
(ViT-B/8) excel on augmented data, enhancing fine-grained detail capture.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that a powerful self-supervised model like DINOv2
fails on the original, limited dataset but is "rescued" by augmentation,
highlighting the critical need for data diversity to unlock its potential.
Preliminary tests with a ViT-Large model show poor performance, underscoring
the risk of using overly-capacitive models on specialized, smaller datasets.
This work provides critical insights into the interplay between model
architecture, data augmentation, and dataset size for medical image
classification.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个HDR数据集AIC-HDR2025，用于高保真范围的图像质量评估，并验证了其精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDR和WCG技术提升了色彩表现，但增加了数据需求，需要更精确的图像质量评估方法。

Method: 创建包含100张测试图像的AIC-HDR2025数据集，进行主观研究（JPEG AIC-3方法）和客观指标评估。

Result: AIC-3方法能精确估计HDR质量，95%置信区间平均宽度为0.27（1 JND）。

Conclusion: AIC-HDR2025数据集填补了HDR质量评估的空白，并公开可用。

Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG) technologies
significantly improve color reproduction compared to standard dynamic range
(SDR) and standard color gamuts, resulting in more accurate, richer, and more
immersive images. However, HDR increases data demands, posing challenges for
bandwidth efficiency and compression techniques.
  Advances in compression and display technologies require more precise image
quality assessment, particularly in the high-fidelity range where perceptual
differences are subtle.
  To address this gap, we introduce AIC-HDR2025, the first such HDR dataset,
comprising 100 test images generated from five HDR sources, each compressed
using four codecs at five compression levels. It covers the high-fidelity
range, from visible distortions to compression levels below the visually
lossless threshold.
  A subjective study was conducted using the JPEG AIC-3 test methodology,
combining plain and boosted triplet comparisons. In total, 34,560 ratings were
collected from 151 participants across four fully controlled labs. The results
confirm that AIC-3 enables precise HDR quality estimation, with 95\% confidence
intervals averaging a width of 0.27 at 1 JND. In addition, several recently
proposed objective metrics were evaluated based on their correlation with
subjective ratings. The dataset is publicly available.

Motivation: 传统聚类方法在缺乏额外信息时存在模糊性，用户可能希望基于不同标准（如形状或颜色）聚类。文本引导聚类方法通过自然语言指令解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ITGC方法，结合无监督聚类目标和迭代发现过程，生成符合用户指令的可视化概念。

Result: 在多种图像聚类和细粒度分类基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITGC通过文本引导和迭代优化，显著提升了聚类的准确性和用户意图的匹配度。

Abstract: Traditional clustering methods aim to group unlabeled data points based on
their similarity to each other. However, clustering, in the absence of
additional information, is an ill-posed problem as there may be many different,
yet equally valid, ways to partition a dataset. Distinct users may want to use
different criteria to form clusters in the same data, e.g. shape v.s. color.
Recently introduced text-guided image clustering methods aim to address this
ambiguity by allowing users to specify the criteria of interest using natural
language instructions. This instruction provides the necessary context and
control needed to obtain clusters that are more aligned with the users' intent.
We propose a new text-guided clustering approach named ITGC that uses an
iterative discovery process, guided by an unsupervised clustering objective, to
generate interpretable visual concepts that better capture the criteria
expressed in a user's instructions. We report superior performance compared to
existing methods across a wide variety of image clustering and fine-grained
classification benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)
under a long-tailed distribution, which involves discovering novel categories
in an unlabelled dataset using knowledge from a set of labelled categories.
Existing works assume a uniform distribution for both datasets, but real-world
data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where a few categories contain
most examples, while others have only a few. While the long-tailed distribution
is well-studied in supervised and semi-supervised settings, it remains
unexplored in the GCD context. We identify two challenges in this setting -
balancing classifier learning and estimating category numbers - and propose a
framework based on confident sample selection and density-based clustering to
tackle them. Our experiments on both long-tailed and conventional GCD datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了扩散模型在图像修复中的性能，解决了颜色和内容融合的关键问题。

Abstract: Image inpainting is the task of reconstructing missing or damaged parts of an
image in a way that seamlessly blends with the surrounding content. With the
advent of advanced generative models, especially diffusion models and
generative adversarial networks, inpainting has achieved remarkable
improvements in visual quality and coherence. However, achieving seamless
continuity remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose two novel
methods to address discrepancy issues in diffusion-based inpainting models.
First, we introduce a modified Variational Autoencoder that corrects color
imbalances, ensuring that the final inpainted results are free of color
mismatches. Second, we propose a two-step training strategy that improves the
blending of generated and existing image content during the diffusion process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods effectively
reduce discontinuity and produce high-quality inpainting results that are
coherent and visually appealing.

Conclusion: 基于深度学习的方法在FoG识别领域具有潜力，可为帕金森病患者提供更好的治疗和管理方案。

Abstract: Freezing of gait (FoG) is a special symptom found in patients with
Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients who have FoG abruptly lose the capacity to
walk as they normally would. Accelerometers worn by patients can record
movement data during these episodes, and machine learning algorithms can be
useful to categorize this information. Thus, the combination may be able to
identify FoG in real time. In order to identify FoG events in accelerometer
data, we introduce the Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM fusion model in this paper.
The model's capability to differentiate between FoG episodes and normal
movement was used to evaluate its performance, and on the Kaggle Parkinson's
Freezing of Gait dataset, the proposed Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM fusion model
produced 92.6% accuracy, 80.9% F1 score, and 52.06% in terms of mean average
precision. The findings highlight how Deep Learning-based approaches may
progress the field of FoG identification and help PD patients receive better
treatments and management plans.

Motivation: 传统图像相似性度量在评估真实场景图像与人工生成视角之间的相似性时效果不佳。

Method: 通过创建人工损坏图像集，测试DreamSim和三种传统度量（SSIM、PSNR、LPIPS）的敏感性和区分能力。

Result: DreamSim对轻微缺陷更鲁棒，能有效评估图像的高层相似性，且在真实场景中更实用。

Conclusion: DreamSim在NVS渲染质量评估中更有效，尤其适用于轻微渲染损坏不影响图像实用性的场景。

Abstract: Traditional image similarity metrics are ineffective at evaluating the
similarity between a real image of a scene and an artificially generated
version of that viewpoint [6, 9, 13, 14]. Our research evaluates the
effectiveness of a new, perceptual-based similarity metric, DreamSim [2], and
three popular image similarity metrics: Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity
(LPIPS) [18, 19] in novel view synthesis (NVS) applications. We create a corpus
of artificially corrupted images to quantify the sensitivity and discriminative
power of each of the image similarity metrics. These tests reveal that
traditional metrics are unable to effectively differentiate between images with
minor pixel-level changes and those with substantial corruption, whereas
DreamSim is more robust to minor defects and can effectively evaluate the
high-level similarity of the image. Additionally, our results demonstrate that
DreamSim provides a more effective and useful evaluation of render quality,
especially for evaluating NVS renders in real-world use cases where slight
rendering corruptions are common, but do not affect image utility for human
tasks.

Result: 在多个医学分类基准测试中，MVP-CBM实现了最优的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: MVP-CBM通过显式建模概念偏好，全面利用多层视觉信息，提供更细致准确的模型解释。

Abstract: The concept bottleneck model (CBM), as a technique improving interpretability
via linking predictions to human-understandable concepts, makes high-risk and
life-critical medical image classification credible. Typically, existing CBM
methods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain
the model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of
concept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated
with the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a
blind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and
thus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,
impairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Multi-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM),
which comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference
modeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with
features at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse
activation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple
layers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept
preferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual
information to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model
decisions. Extensive experiments on several public medical classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MVP-CBM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
interoperability, verifying its superiority. Code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, large transformer-based video encoder models have greatly
advanced state-of-the-art performance on video classification tasks. However,
these large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from
multiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach
fails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video
durations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature
significance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require
significant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them
impractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model
performance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our
framework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of
embeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally
preserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then
learn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing
us to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a
new neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment
algorithms for this learning task. Our evaluation demonstrates that DejaVid
substantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art large encoder,
achieving leading Top-1 accuracy of 77.2% on Something-Something V2, 89.1% on
Kinetics-400, and 88.6% on HMDB51, while adding fewer than 1.8% additional
learnable parameters and requiring less than 3 hours of training time. Our code
is available at https://github.com/darrylho/DejaVid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisFlow是一个无需训练的框架，通过调整注意力模式减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的视觉幻觉（VH）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM在多模态任务中表现优异，但存在视觉幻觉问题，即对视觉内容的错误描述。

Method: 通过分析注意力行为，提出两种干预方法：TAI（增强视觉内容注意力）和HAI（抑制对提示和文本的过度关注）。

Result: VisFlow有效减少幻觉并提升视觉事实性，计算成本极低。

Conclusion: VisFlow为LVLM的视觉幻觉问题提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they remain prone to visual
hallucination (VH), often producing confident but incorrect descriptions of
visual content. We present VisFlow, an efficient and training-free framework
designed to mitigate VH by directly manipulating attention patterns during
inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify three key pathological
attention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) weak visual grounding, where attention to
visual tokens is insufficient or misallocated, over-focusing on uninformative
regions; (2) language prior dominance, where excessive attention to prior
response tokens reinforces autoregressive patterns and impairs multimodal
alignment; (3) prompt redundancy, where many attention heads fixate on system
prompt tokens, disrupting the integration of image, instruction, and response
content. To address these issues, we introduce two inference-time
interventions: token-level attention intervention (TAI), which enhances focus
on salient visual content, and head-level attention intervention (HAI), which
suppresses over-attention to prompt and nearby text tokens. VisFlow operates
without additional training or model modifications. Extensive experiments
across models and benchmarks show that VisFlow effectively reduces
hallucinations and improves visual factuality, with negligible computational
cost.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable advancements but at the cost of
significant computational resources. This has created an urgent need for a
novel and energy-efficient computational fabric. CMOS Oscillator Networks
(OscNet) is a brain inspired and specially designed hardware for low energy
consumption. In this paper, we propose a Hopfield Network based machine
learning algorithm that can be implemented on OscNet. The network is trained
using forward propagation alone to learn sparsely connected weights, yet
achieves an 8% improvement in accuracy compared to conventional deep learning
models on MNIST dataset. OscNet v1.5 achieves competitive accuracy on MNIST and
is well-suited for implementation using CMOS-compatible ring oscillator arrays
with SHIL. In oscillator-based implementation, we utilize only 24% of the
connections used in a fully connected Hopfield network, with merely a 0.1% drop
in accuracy. OscNet v1.5 relies solely on forward propagation and employs
sparse connections, making it an energy-efficient machine learning pipeline
designed for CMOS oscillator computing. The repository for OscNet family is:

Abstract: We study multi-modal summarization for instructional videos, whose goal is to
provide users an efficient way to learn skills in the form of text instructions

semantic-level video summarization, and are not suitable for providing
step-by-step executable instructions and illustrations, both of which are
crucial for instructional videos. We propose a novel benchmark for user
interface (UI) instructional video summarization to fill the gap. We collect a
dataset of 2,413 UI instructional videos, which spans over 167 hours. These
videos are manually annotated for video segmentation, text summarization, and
video summarization, which enable the comprehensive evaluations for concise and
executable video summarization. We conduct extensive experiments on our
collected MS4UI dataset, which suggest that state-of-the-art multi-modal
summarization methods struggle on UI video summarization, and highlight the
importance of new methods for UI instructional video summarization.

Motivation: 解决先前方法依赖外部模型评估的问题，使其适用于资源有限的设备。

Conclusion: 优化初始噪声的方法在小VRAM GPU上高效可行。

Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that investing computing resources in searching
for good initial noise for a text-to-image diffusion model helps improve
performance. However, previous studies required external models to evaluate the
resulting images, which is impossible on GPUs with small VRAM. For these
reasons, we apply Best-of-N inference-time scaling to algorithms that optimize
the initial noise of a diffusion model without external models across multiple
datasets and backbones. We demonstrate that inference-time scaling for
text-to-image diffusion models in this setting quickly reaches a performance
plateau, and a relatively small number of optimization steps suffices to
achieve the maximum achievable performance with each algorithm.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了手部细节缺失问题，并扩展了任务的灵活性。

Abstract: The malformed hands in the AI-generated images seriously affect the
authenticity of the images. To refine malformed hands, existing depth-based
approaches use a hand depth estimator to guide the refinement of malformed
hands. Due to the performance limitations of the hand depth estimator, many
hand details cannot be represented, resulting in errors in the generated hands,
such as confusing the palm and the back of the hand. To solve this problem, we
propose a 3D mesh-guided refinement framework using a diffusion pipeline. We
use a state-of-the-art 3D hand mesh estimator, which provides more details of
the hands. For training, we collect and reannotate a dataset consisting of RGB
images and 3D hand mesh. Then we design a diffusion inpainting model to
generate refined outputs guided by 3D hand meshes. For inference, we propose a
double check algorithm to facilitate the 3D hand mesh estimator to obtain
robust hand mesh guidance to obtain our refined results. Beyond malformed hand
refinement, we propose a novel hand pose transformation method. It increases
the flexibility and diversity of the malformed hand refinement task. We made
the restored images mimic the hand poses of the reference images. The pose
transformation requires no additional training. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.

public and private sources, we apply zero-shot and one-shot prompting methods
to assess VLM performance, comparing them against custom-trained Convolutional

significantly improves VLM performance over zero-shot ($p \approx 1.005 \times
10^{-5}$ based on Kappa scores), these general-purpose VLMs currently
underperform supervised CNNs on most tasks. This work underscores both the

Motivation: 无人机图像中小目标检测面临目标尺寸小、信噪比低和特征提取有限等挑战，现有方法计算负担重且模糊细节。

Method: MGDFIS包含三个模块：FusionLock-TSS注意力模块、全局-细节集成模块和动态像素注意力模块，分别优化光谱空间线索、多尺度上下文融合和像素级权重分配。

Result: 在VisDrone基准测试中，MGDFIS优于现有方法，实现高精度和低推理时间。

Conclusion: MGDFIS在精度和资源使用间取得平衡，为资源受限的无人机平台提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as
search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it
is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited
feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add
computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in
cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the
Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified
fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost
detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three
synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries
token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight
spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration
Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and
parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and
the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps
to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen
responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone
benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks,
achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an
optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a
practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV
platforms.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了长尾数据集上的自监督学习性能，通过学习平衡且分离良好的表示。

Abstract: This work addresses the task of self-supervised learning (SSL) on a
long-tailed dataset that aims to learn balanced and well-separated
representations for downstream tasks such as image classification. This task is
crucial because the real world contains numerous object categories, and their
distributions are inherently imbalanced. Towards robust SSL on a
class-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using
unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online.
We first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by
back-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a
domain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are
designed to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently,
we further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning
while using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding
network is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the
strengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning. We also
distil and transfer its embedding space to the training network to maintain
balancedness and separability. Through experiments on four publicly available
long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在视觉与文本数据的联合嵌入空间中表现出色，但其对图像模态的对抗攻击仍然脆弱，存在安全隐患。

Method: 1. 将AdvPT从纯文本提示扩展到多模态提示；2. 从单层提示架构扩展到多层；3. 提出神经增强器框架，通过特征净化直接解决对抗攻击引入的特征空间扭曲。

Conclusion: NAP-Tuning通过多模态和分层提示架构以及特征净化机制，显著提升了视觉语言模型在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，同时保持了干净的准确性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in understanding relationships between visual and textual data
through joint embedding spaces. Despite their effectiveness, these models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality,
posing significant security concerns. Building upon our previous work on
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to
enhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we
present a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework
for Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations
include: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across
both text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer
prompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign
through our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to
directly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature
space. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to
reconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for
modality-specific and layer-specific feature correction.Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing
methods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows
significant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging
AutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on
ViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Abstract: The segmentation of coal maceral groups can be described as a semantic
segmentation process of coal maceral group images, which is of great
significance for studying the chemical properties of coal. Generally, existing
semantic segmentation models of coal maceral groups use the method of stacking
parameters to achieve higher accuracy. It leads to increased computational
requirements and impacts model training efficiency. At the same time, due to
the professionalism and diversity of coal maceral group images sampling,
obtaining the number of samples for model training requires a long time and
professional personnel operation. To address these issues, We have innovatively
developed an IoT-based DA-VIT parallel network model. By utilizing this model,
we can continuously broaden the dataset through IoT and achieving sustained
improvement in the accuracy of coal maceral groups segmentation. Besides, we
decouple the parallel network from the backbone network to ensure the normal
using of the backbone network during model data updates. Secondly, DCSA
mechanism of DA-VIT is introduced to enhance the local feature information of
coal microscopic images. This DCSA can decompose the large kernels of
convolutional attention into multiple scales and reduce 81.18% of
parameters.Finally, we performed the contrast experiment and ablation
experiment between DA-VIT and state-of-the-art methods at lots of evaluation
metrics. Experimental results show that DA-VIT-Base achieves 92.14% pixel
accuracy and 63.18% mIoU. Params and FLOPs of DA-VIT-Tiny are 4.95M and 8.99G,
respectively. All of the evaluation metrics of the proposed DA-VIT are better
than other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GenMOJO在复杂场景的新视角合成和点轨迹生成方面表现更优，为动态场景重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating dynamic 4D scenes from monocular,
multi-object videos with heavy occlusions, and introduce GenMOJO, a novel
approach that integrates rendering-based deformable 3D Gaussian optimization
with generative priors for view synthesis. While existing models perform well
on novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to
complex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into
individual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per
object. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric
diffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs
joint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object
occlusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between
object-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos,
GenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering
constraints within a unified framework. The resulting model generates 4D object
reconstructions over space and time, and produces accurate 2D and 3D point
tracks from monocular input. Quantitative evaluations and perceptual human
studies confirm that GenMOJO generates more realistic novel views of scenes and
produces more accurate point tracks compared to existing approaches.

Result: 实验显示，方法实现1.5倍加速且精度下降小于3%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SP-VLA通过聚焦关键动作和视觉信息，有效平衡加速与精度，适用于实时任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for
their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and
low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as
robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration
methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that
these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result,
temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in
visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified
framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning
tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that
reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a
lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key
decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA
actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model
and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive
execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial
redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning
method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based
on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two
mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and
salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining
high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to
1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming
existing approaches in multiple tasks.

Result: 实验表明，DMS在VQA、图像-文本检索和字幕生成任务中显著提升了性能，尤其在模态损坏或缺失情况下。

Conclusion: DMS为多模态建模提供了一种通用且有效的实例感知和鲁棒性增强机制。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
vision-language understanding and generation tasks. However, existing MLLMs
typically rely on static modality fusion strategies, which treat all modalities
equally regardless of their instance-level reliability or semantic
contribution. This often leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
scenarios with noisy, missing, or misaligned modalities.
  In this paper, we propose Dynamic Modality Scheduling (DMS), a novel
framework that adaptively adjusts the contribution of each modality at a
per-sample level. DMS evaluates each modality based on three key factors: (1)
\textit{confidence}, estimated from predictive entropy; (2)
\textit{uncertainty}, obtained via Monte Carlo dropout; and (3)
\textit{semantic consistency}, computed through inter-modal similarity. These
signals are combined through a learnable or rule-based scheduler to generate
soft modality weights used in downstream fusion.To ensure stable training, we
further introduce a \textit{Modality Weight Consistency Loss}, which
regularizes the fused representation to stay close to unimodal embeddings
proportionally to their assigned weights. Our method is model-agnostic and can
be integrated into existing MLLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVA. Experimental
results on VQA, image-text retrieval, and captioning tasks show that DMS
significantly improves both clean and robust performance, especially under
modality corruption or dropout conditions. This work provides a general and
effective mechanism to enable instance-aware and robustness-enhanced multimodal
modeling.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a preferred choice alongside
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in inverse rendering due to its superior
rendering speed. Currently, the common approach in 3DGS is to utilize
"single-view" mini-batch training, where only one image is processed per
iteration, in contrast to NeRF's "multi-view" mini-batch training, which
leverages multiple images. We observe that such single-view training can lead
to suboptimal optimization due to increased variance in mini-batch stochastic
gradients, highlighting the necessity for multi-view training. However,
implementing multi-view training in 3DGS poses challenges. Simply rendering
multiple images per iteration incurs considerable overhead and may result in
suboptimal Gaussian densification due to its reliance on single-view
assumptions. To address these issues, we modify the rasterization process to
minimize the overhead associated with multi-view training and propose a 3D
distance-aware D-SSIM loss and multi-view adaptive density control that better
suits multi-view scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
methods significantly enhance the performance of 3DGS and its variants, freeing
3DGS from the constraints of single-view training.

Result: 在图像-文本检索、字幕生成和视觉问答等任务中表现优于CLIP、ALBEF和BLIP等基线模型，且在模态损坏和领域迁移下表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 自适应融合的重要性被凸显，为可靠且不确定性感知的多模态学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have achieved impressive progress across a wide
range of vision-language tasks. However, existing approaches often adopt fixed
or task-specific fusion strategies, neglecting the intrinsic variability of
modality reliability and sample complexity. In this paper, we propose
Modality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Scheduling (MA-AFS), a general framework that
learns to dynamically modulate the contribution of each modality on a
per-instance basis. MA-AFS introduces a lightweight neural scheduler that
predicts modality fusion weights by integrating visual and textual entropy
signals along with cross-modal agreement cues. This enables the model to
adaptively emphasize more reliable modalities, especially under noisy, missing,
or misaligned inputs. We formulate the fusion process as a differentiable
scheduling mechanism, analyze its theoretical consistency and regularization
effect, and demonstrate that it improves robustness without increasing model
capacity significantly. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval,
captioning, and visual question answering show that MA-AFS achieves consistent
performance gains over strong baselines such as CLIP, ALBEF, and BLIP.
Moreover, MA-AFS exhibits improved robustness under modality corruption and
enhanced generalization under domain shifts. Our work highlights the importance
of adaptive fusion and opens a promising direction toward reliable and
uncertainty-aware multimodal learning.

*Changsheng Gao,Shan Liu,Feng Wu,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨架构通用特征编码（CAUFC）方法，通过两步分布对齐解决CNN和Transformer特征压缩的统一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征编码方法多为架构特定，限制了在CNN和Transformer特征共存场景的应用。

Method: 提出两步分布对齐：格式对齐统一特征为2D token格式，特征值对齐通过截断和归一化调和统计分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像分类任务中优于架构特定基线，实现了更好的率-精度权衡。

Conclusion: 这是迈向跨异构模型架构通用特征压缩的初步尝试。

Abstract: Feature coding has become increasingly important in scenarios where semantic
representations rather than raw pixels are transmitted and stored. However,
most existing methods are architecture-specific, targeting either CNNs or
Transformers. This design limits their applicability in real-world scenarios
where features from both architectures coexist. To address this gap, we
introduce a new research problem: cross-architecture universal feature coding
(CAUFC), which seeks to build a unified codec that can effectively compress
features from heterogeneous architectures. To tackle this challenge, we propose
a two-step distribution alignment method. First, we design the format alignment
method that unifies CNN and Transformer features into a consistent 2D token
format. Second, we propose the feature value alignment method that harmonizes
statistical distributions via truncation and normalization. As a first attempt
to study CAUFC, we evaluate our method on the image classification task.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior
rate-accuracy trade-offs compared to the architecture-specific baseline. This
work marks an initial step toward universal feature compression across
heterogeneous model architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Adaptive Dropout的新正则化方法，用于解决盲超分辨率（blind SR）中中间层特征泛化不足的问题，通过改进dropout形式和自适应训练策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲超分辨率模型在未知退化情况下泛化能力不足，现有方法仅关注最终层的特征正则化，忽略了中间层特征的泛化需求，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Adaptive Dropout，重新设计dropout形式以缓解训练-测试不一致性，并通过层间自适应训练策略增强特征传播。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有正则化方法，且在其他图像修复任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: Adaptive Dropout通过解决中间层特征泛化问题，显著提升了盲超分辨率模型的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Blind Super-Resolution (blind SR) aims to enhance the model's generalization
ability with unknown degradation, yet it still encounters severe overfitting
issues. Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances
generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind
SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before
the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at
intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at
intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized
feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying
dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which
we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it
introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method
for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates
application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for
training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate
the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in
generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an
adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise
annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past
regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets,
also highly effective in other image restoration tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: SuperPoint-SLAM3通过替换ORB为自监督的SuperPoint检测器-描述符，结合ANMS和NetVLAD，显著提升了ORB-SLAM3在极端条件下的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ORB-SLAM3在极端视角、尺度和光照变化下表现不佳，因其依赖手工设计的ORB关键点。

Method: （1）用SuperPoint替换ORB；（2）通过ANMS实现空间均匀的关键点；（3）集成NetVLAD进行学习式闭环检测。

Result: 在KITTI和EuRoC数据集上，平移和旋转误差显著降低，如KITTI平移误差从4.15%降至0.34%。

Conclusion: 结合深度特征和学习式闭环模块可显著提升SLAM精度，同时保持实时性。

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) must remain accurate
under extreme viewpoint, scale and illumination variations. The widely adopted
ORB-SLAM3 falters in these regimes because it relies on hand-crafted ORB
keypoints. We introduce SuperPoint-SLAM3, a drop-in upgrade that (i) replaces
ORB with the self-supervised SuperPoint detector--descriptor, (ii) enforces
spatially uniform keypoints via adaptive non-maximal suppression (ANMS), and
(iii) integrates a lightweight NetVLAD place-recognition head for
learning-based loop closure.
  On the KITTI Odometry benchmark SuperPoint-SLAM3 reduces mean translational
error from 4.15% to 0.34% and mean rotational error from 0.0027 deg/m to 0.0010
deg/m. On the EuRoC MAV dataset it roughly halves both errors across every
sequence (e.g., V2\_03: 1.58% -> 0.79%). These gains confirm that fusing modern
deep features with a learned loop-closure module markedly improves ORB-SLAM3
accuracy while preserving its real-time operation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有单数据集训练的医学影像分割模型对未见器官或肿瘤的鲁棒性不足，需开发能识别罕见或新肿瘤类别的模型。

Method: DSM利用改进的注意力解码器训练两组对象查询，通过器官查询和扩散引导的肿瘤查询实现精确分割，并结合CLIP文本嵌入提升语义分割性能。

Result: 实验表明DSM在多种肿瘤分割任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DSM通过扩散和状态空间模型显著提升了未见肿瘤类别的分割能力，为医学影像应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset
often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a
robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present
during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We
propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models
to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two
sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance
classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an
object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features.
It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts,
enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we
incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation
performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures
category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby
enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label
tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in
various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Result: DeepPro在广泛使用的基准测试中优于现有方法，尤其在弱目标和复杂场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: 论文为红外小目标检测提供了新的建模域、见解、方法和性能，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Infrared small target (IRST) detection is challenging in simultaneously
achieving precise, universal, robust and efficient performance due to extremely
dim targets and strong interference. Current learning-based methods attempt to
leverage ``more" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal
domains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while
incurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more
essential" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through
theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and
correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant
superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate
whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks,
we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the
importance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above
conclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal
anomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network
(DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST
detection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the
effectiveness of our method. The experimental results are exciting, as our
DeepPro outperforms existing state-of-the-art IRST detection methods on
widely-used benchmarks with extremely high efficiency, and achieves a
significant improvement on dim targets and in complex scenarios. We provide a
new modeling domain, a new insight, a new method, and a new performance, which
can promote the development of IRST detection. Codes are available at

Conclusion: ULOPS通过不确定性建模和损失函数设计，有效解决了开放环境中的未知物体检测问题。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter
previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic
segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown
object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided
open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based
evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture
incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty
estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center
prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and
segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate
between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss
functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown
regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference
in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale.
Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level.
To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and
introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR
panoptic segmentation methods.

Result: 在SSDD数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了船舶检测精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入先验知识，显著提升了SAR船舶检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: DL based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection has tremendous
advantages in numerous areas. However, it still faces some problems, such as
the lack of prior knowledge, which seriously affects detection accuracy. In
order to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method
based on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical
two-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and
sea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module
(LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on
land according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add
prior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby
reducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore
detection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection
and enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration
of the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR
ship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the
input data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land
segmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation
information as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land. We
conducted our experiments using the publicly available SSDD dataset, which
demonstrated the effectiveness of our network.

Conclusion: 论文通过新基准和框架解决了VLM的'分辨率困境'，为开源社区提供了系统性解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face significant challenges when dealing with
the diverse resolutions and aspect ratios of real-world images, as most
existing models rely on fixed, low-resolution inputs. While recent studies have
explored integrating native resolution visual encoding to improve model
performance, such efforts remain fragmented and lack a systematic framework
within the open-source community. Moreover, existing benchmarks fall short in
evaluating VLMs under varied visual conditions, often neglecting resolution as
a critical factor. To address the "Resolution Dilemma" stemming from both model
design and benchmark limitations, we introduce RC-Bench, a novel benchmark
specifically designed to systematically evaluate VLM capabilities under extreme
visual conditions, with an emphasis on resolution and aspect ratio variations.
In conjunction, we propose NativeRes-LLaVA, an open-source training framework
that empowers VLMs to effectively process images at their native resolutions
and aspect ratios. Based on RC-Bench and NativeRes-LLaVA, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on existing visual encoding strategies. The results
show that Native Resolution Visual Encoding significantly improves the
performance of VLMs on RC-Bench as well as other resolution-centric benchmarks.

Abstract: The advent of 6G networks demands unprecedented levels of intelligence,
adaptability, and efficiency to address challenges such as ultra-high-speed
data transmission, ultra-low latency, and massive connectivity in dynamic
environments. Traditional wireless image transmission frameworks, reliant on
static configurations and isolated source-channel coding, struggle to balance
computational efficiency, robustness, and quality under fluctuating channel

source-channel coding (JSCC) framework tailored for resource-constrained 6G
networks. Our approach integrates key information extraction and adaptive
background synthesis to enable intelligent, semantic-aware transmission.
Leveraging AI-driven tools, Mediapipe for human pose detection and Rembg for
background removal, the model dynamically isolates foreground features and
matches backgrounds from a pre-trained library, reducing data payloads while
preserving visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared with traditional
JSCC method, especially under low-SNR conditions. This approach offers a
practical solution for multimedia services in resource-constrained mobile

Result: 实验显示SwiftWRF比现有方法快500倍，信号质量显著提升。

Conclusion: SwiftWRF为无线辐射场建模提供高效解决方案，适用于定位和信号预测等任务。

Abstract: Modeling the wireless radiance field (WRF) is fundamental to modern
communication systems, enabling key tasks such as localization, sensing, and
channel estimation. Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or
physical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong
scene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve
reconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their
reliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries
hinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
Gaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in
modeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF
reconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian
splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under
single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated
rasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP
to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing
mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the
efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in
angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
prediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor
scenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster
than existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its
signal quality. Code and datasets will be released.

Abstract: Single-view textured human reconstruction aims to reconstruct a clothed 3D
digital human by inputting a monocular 2D image. Existing approaches include
feed-forward methods, limited by scarce 3D human data, and diffusion-based
methods, prone to erroneous 2D hallucinations. To address these issues, we
propose a novel SMPL normal map Equipped 3D Human Reconstruction (SEHR)
framework, integrating a pretrained large 3D reconstruction model with human
geometry prior. SEHR performs single-view human reconstruction without using a
preset diffusion model in one forward propagation. Concretely, SEHR consists of
two key components: SMPL Normal Map Guidance (SNMG) and SMPL Normal Map
Constraint (SNMC). SNMG incorporates SMPL normal maps into an auxiliary network
to provide improved body shape guidance. SNMC enhances invisible body parts by
constraining the model to predict an extra SMPL normal Gaussians. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEHR outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Haoyou Deng,Zhiqiang Li,Feng Zhang,Qingbo Lu,Zisheng Cao,Yuanjie Shao,Shuhang Gu,Changxin Gao,Nong Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Rehazy的新训练策略，通过利用真实雾霾图像和重新生成的雾霾图像对，提升去雾性能和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像去雾任务中因过拟合合成数据而泛化能力差，且训练不稳定。

Method: 提出Rehazy策略，基于物理模型生成高质量重新雾霾图像，并设计双分支框架（干净分支和雾霾分支）进行训练。

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现优异，SOTS-Indoor和SOTS-Outdoor数据集的PSNR分别提升3.58 dB和1.85 dB。

Conclusion: Rehazy策略显著提升了去雾性能和训练稳定性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Overfitting to synthetic training pairs remains a critical challenge in image
dehazing, leading to poor generalization capability to real-world scenarios. To
address this issue, existing approaches utilize unpaired realistic data for
training, employing CycleGAN or contrastive learning frameworks. Despite their
progress, these methods often suffer from training instability, resulting in
limited dehazing performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training
strategy for unpaired image dehazing, termed Rehazy, to improve both dehazing
performance and training stability. This strategy explores the consistency of
the underlying clean images across hazy images and utilizes hazy-rehazy pairs
for effective learning of real haze characteristics. To favorably construct
hazy-rehazy pairs, we develop a physics-based rehazy generation pipeline, which
is theoretically validated to reliably produce high-quality rehazy images.
Additionally, leveraging the rehazy strategy, we introduce a dual-branch
framework for dehazing network training, where a clean branch provides a basic
dehazing capability in a synthetic manner, and a hazy branch enhances the
generalization ability with hazy-rehazy pairs. Moreover, we design a new
dehazing network within these branches to improve the efficiency, which
progressively restores clean scenes from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments
on four benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach,
exceeding the previous state-of-the-art methods by 3.58 dB on the SOTS-Indoor
dataset and by 1.85 dB on the SOTS-Outdoor dataset in PSNR. Our code will be
publicly available.

### [122] [LOP: Learning Optimal Pruning for Efficient On-Demand MLLMs Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12826)
*Zhihan Zhang,Xiang Pan,Hongchen Wei,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOP是一种高效的多模态大语言模型剪枝框架，通过直接预测剪枝策略，避免了传统迭代搜索的高计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前剪枝方法依赖迭代搜索，计算成本高，难以满足多硬件平台的需求。

Method: LOP利用自回归神经网络直接预测适应目标约束的剪枝策略。

Result: 实验表明，LOP在多项指标上优于现有方法，且速度提升高达三个数量级。

Conclusion: LOP为高效剪枝提供了新思路，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Structural pruning techniques are essential for deploying multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) across various hardware platforms, from edge devices to
cloud servers. However, current pruning methods typically determine optimal
strategies through iterative search processes, resulting in substantial
computational overhead for on-demand MLLMs adaptation. To address this
challenge, we propose LOP, an efficient neural pruning framework that learns
optimal pruning strategies from the target pruning constraint, eliminating the
need for computationally expensive search-based methods. LOP approach trains
autoregressive neural networks (NNs) to directly predict layer-wise pruning
strategies adaptive to the target pruning constraint, eliminating the
time-consuming iterative searches. Experimental results across multiple tasks
show that LOP outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in various metrics
while achieving up to three orders of magnitude speedup.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ComplexBench-Edit基准和基于Chain-of-Thought的方法，用于评估和改进模型处理复杂多步图像编辑指令的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中图像编辑常涉及复杂、多步的指令，现有模型和基准在此类任务上表现不足。

Method: 提出了ComplexBench-Edit基准和新的一致性评估方法，并设计了一种基于Chain-of-Thought的改进方法。

Result: 实验证明ComplexBench-Edit能有效区分模型能力，且CoT方法显著提升了复杂指令的遵循能力。

Conclusion: ComplexBench-Edit和CoT方法为复杂图像编辑任务提供了有效的评估和改进工具。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing has achieved remarkable success in following single
instructions. However, real-world scenarios often involve complex, multi-step
instructions, particularly ``chain'' instructions where operations are
interdependent. Current models struggle with these intricate directives, and
existing benchmarks inadequately evaluate such capabilities. Specifically, they
often overlook multi-instruction and chain-instruction complexities, and common
consistency metrics are flawed. To address this, we introduce
ComplexBench-Edit, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess model
performance on complex, multi-instruction, and chain-dependent image editing
tasks. ComplexBench-Edit also features a new vision consistency evaluation
method that accurately assesses non-modified regions by excluding edited areas.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based
approach that significantly enhances the ability of existing models to follow
complex instructions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate ComplexBench-Edit's
efficacy in differentiating model capabilities and highlight the superior
performance of our CoT-based method in handling complex edits. The data and
code are released at https://github.com/llllly26/ComplexBench-Edit.

TL;DR: DiffS-NOCS提出了一种基于扩散模型的方法，通过多视角解码器从2D草图生成NOCS地图，并重建3D点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从2D草图重建3D点云时面临领域多变性和准确性不足的问题，且缺乏多模态控制能力。

Method: 利用ControlNet和改进的多视角解码器生成NOCS地图，结合视角编码器和特征级多视角聚合网络提升3D一致性。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，DiffS-NOCS能够实现可控且精细的点云重建。

Conclusion: DiffS-NOCS通过多模态融合和跨视角信息交换，显著提升了草图到3D点云的重建效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D point cloud from a given conditional sketch is
challenging. Existing methods often work directly in 3D space, but domain
variability and difficulty in reconstructing accurate 3D structures from 2D
sketches remain significant obstacles. Moreover, ideal models should also
accept prompts for control, in addition with the sparse sketch, posing
challenges in multi-modal fusion. We propose DiffS-NOCS (Diffusion-based
Sketch-to-NOCS Map), which leverages ControlNet with a modified multi-view
decoder to generate NOCS maps with embedded 3D structure and position
information in 2D space from sketches. The 3D point cloud is reconstructed by
combining multiple NOCS maps from different views. To enhance sketch
understanding, we integrate a viewpoint encoder for extracting viewpoint
features. Additionally, we design a feature-level multi-view aggregation
network as the denoising module, facilitating cross-view information exchange
and improving 3D consistency in NOCS map generation. Experiments on ShapeNet
demonstrate that DiffS-NOCS achieves controllable and fine-grained point cloud
reconstruction aligned with sketches.

Motivation: 现有卷积和基于Transformer的变化检测方法在局部与全局依赖关系交互方面不明确，且标准自注意力存在局限性，如难以捕捉细微变化、计算复杂度高。

Method: 提出Siamese框架HyRet-Change，结合卷积和多头保留机制，并行捕捉互补信息；引入自适应局部-全局交互上下文感知机制。

Result: 在三个挑战性变化检测数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HyRet-Change框架有效整合了卷积和保留机制的优势，提升了复杂场景下的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Recently convolution and transformer-based change detection (CD) methods
provide promising performance. However, it remains unclear how the local and
global dependencies interact to effectively alleviate the pseudo changes.
Moreover, directly utilizing standard self-attention presents intrinsic
limitations including governing global feature representations limit to capture
subtle changes, quadratic complexity, and restricted training parallelism. To
address these limitations, we propose a Siamese-based framework, called
HyRet-Change, which can seamlessly integrate the merits of convolution and
retention mechanisms at multi-scale features to preserve critical information
and enhance adaptability in complex scenes. Specifically, we introduce a novel
feature difference module to exploit both convolutions and multi-head retention
mechanisms in a parallel manner to capture complementary information.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive local-global interactive context awareness
mechanism that enables mutual learning and enhances discrimination capability
through information exchange. We perform experiments on three challenging CD
datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微手势因其细微、短暂和低运动幅度的特点难以建模和分类，本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用PoseC3D框架，引入拓扑感知骨架表示、改进的时间处理策略和语义标签嵌入作为辅助监督。

Result: 在iMiGUE测试集上Top-1准确率为67.01%，在MiGA挑战赛中排名第三。

Abstract: We present our solution to the MiGA Challenge at IJCAI 2025, which aims to
recognize micro-gestures (MGs) from skeleton sequences for the purpose of
hidden emotion understanding. MGs are characterized by their subtlety, short
duration, and low motion amplitude, making them particularly challenging to
model and classify. We adopt PoseC3D as the baseline framework and introduce
three key enhancements: (1) a topology-aware skeleton representation
specifically designed for the iMiGUE dataset to better capture fine-grained
motion patterns; (2) an improved temporal processing strategy that facilitates
smoother and more temporally consistent motion modeling; and (3) the
incorporation of semantic label embeddings as auxiliary supervision to improve
the model generalization. Our method achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 67.01\% on
the iMiGUE test set. As a result of these contributions, our approach ranks
third on the official MiGA Challenge leaderboard. The source code is available

Motivation: 医学视觉问答中，感知与推理阶段的对齐以及推理到答案生成的一致性问题是主要挑战，且缺乏高质量数据集支持大规模强化学习。

Method: 提出了Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization（CAPO）框架，结合奖励机制确保感知与推理的保真度、推理到答案的一致性，以及最终答案的规则准确性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在域内和域外场景中均优于现有视觉语言模型，并展示了在3D Med-VQA基准和R1-like训练范式中的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CAPO框架和Med-Zero-17K数据集有效解决了Med-VQA中的关键挑战，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), achieving accurate responses
relies on three critical steps: precise perception of medical imaging data,
logical reasoning grounded in visual input and textual questions, and coherent
answer derivation from the reasoning process. Recent advances in general
vision-language models (VLMs) show that large-scale reinforcement learning (RL)
could significantly enhance both reasoning capabilities and overall model
performance. However, their application in medical domains is hindered by two
fundamental challenges: 1) misalignment between perceptual understanding and
reasoning stages, and 2) inconsistency between reasoning pathways and answer
generation, both compounded by the scarcity of high-quality medical datasets
for effective large-scale RL. In this paper, we first introduce Med-Zero-17K, a
curated dataset for pure RL-based training, encompassing over 30 medical image
modalities and 24 clinical tasks. Moreover, we propose a novel large-scale RL
framework for Med-VLMs, Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which
integrates rewards to ensure fidelity between perception and reasoning,
consistency in reasoning-to-answer derivation, and rule-based accuracy for
final responses. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain
scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong VLM baselines,
showcasing strong generalization capability to 3D Med-VQA benchmarks and
R1-like training paradigms.

Motivation: 传统视频修复方法在长期时间特征利用和时间一致性上表现不佳，尤其是在处理大面积掩码时效果较差。

Method: 采用扩散Transformer（DiT）结合扩散模型和Transformer架构，提出Circular Position-Shift策略增强时间一致性，并支持自动检测和交互式移除视频中的对象。

Conclusion: 该方法在视频修复任务中表现出色，尤其在长期时间一致性和大面积掩码修复方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Video object removal and inpainting are critical tasks in the fields of
computer vision and multimedia processing, aimed at restoring missing or
corrupted regions in video sequences. Traditional methods predominantly rely on
flow-based propagation and spatio-temporal Transformers, but these approaches
face limitations in effectively leveraging long-term temporal features and
ensuring temporal consistency in the completion results, particularly when
dealing with large masks. Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas
remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel
video inpainting approach leveraging the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiT
synergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer
architectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring
high-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy
to further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage.
Additionally, the proposed method automatically detects objects within videos,
interactively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts.
In terms of processing speed, it takes only 180 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA
A100 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $1080 \times 1920$ with 121
frames without any acceleration method. Experimental results indicate that the
proposed method demonstrates superior performance in content fidelity, texture
restoration, and temporal consistency. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位模型易受对抗攻击影响，需开发防御方法。

Method: 1. 使用FFA减少对抗和原始伪造图像的特征分布差异；2. 通过MgR优化防御扰动，确保对两种图像均有效。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著恢复对抗图像上的定位性能，且不影响原始伪造图像的定位效果。

Conclusion: 首次在图像伪造定位任务中实现对抗防御，并开源代码和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly propelled the development
of image forgery localization. However, existing models remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks: imperceptible noise added to forged images
can severely mislead these models. In this paper, we address this challenge
with an Adversarial Noise Suppression Module (ANSM) that generate a defensive
perturbation to suppress the attack effect of adversarial noise. We observe
that forgery-relevant features extracted from adversarial and original forged
images exhibit distinct distributions. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Forgery-relevant Features Alignment (FFA) as a first-stage training strategy,
which reduces distributional discrepancies by minimizing the channel-wise
Kullback-Leibler divergence between these features. To further refine the
defensive perturbation, we design a second-stage training strategy, termed
Mask-guided Refinement (MgR), which incorporates a dual-mask constraint. MgR
ensures that the perturbation remains effective for both adversarial and
original forged images, recovering forgery localization accuracy to their
original level. Extensive experiments across various attack algorithms
demonstrate that our method significantly restores the forgery localization
model's performance on adversarial images. Notably, when ANSM is applied to
original forged images, the performance remains nearly unaffected. To our best
knowledge, this is the first report of adversarial defense in image forgery
localization tasks. We have released the source code and anti-forensics
dataset.

Conclusion: 不同网络架构的频率偏好差异直接影响模型鲁棒性，提出了三条实用建议供AI安全社区参考。

Abstract: Adversarial examples have attracted significant attention over the years, yet
understanding their frequency-based characteristics remains insufficient. In
this paper, we investigate the intriguing properties of adversarial examples in
the frequency domain for the image classification task, with the following key
findings. (1) As the high-frequency components increase, the performance gap
between adversarial and natural examples becomes increasingly pronounced. (2)
The model performance against filtered adversarial examples initially increases
to a peak and declines to its inherent robustness. (3) In Convolutional Neural
Networks, mid- and high-frequency components of adversarial examples exhibit
their attack capabilities, while in Transformers, low- and mid-frequency
components of adversarial examples are particularly effective. These results
suggest that different network architectures have different frequency
preferences and that differences in frequency components between adversarial
and natural examples may directly influence model robustness. Based on our
findings, we further conclude with three useful proposals that serve as a
valuable reference to the AI model security community.

Result: 在多年度Sentinel-2数据集上验证，分类准确性和不确定性估计显著优于现有方法，尤其在低数据量和早季分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: 基于温度数据的采样策略提升了跨季节预测性能和实际应用的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Conventional benchmarks for crop type classification from optical satellite
time series typically assume access to labeled data from the same year and rely
on fixed calendar-day sampling. This limits generalization across seasons,
where crop phenology shifts due to interannual climate variability, and
precludes real-time application when current-year labels are unavailable.
Furthermore, uncertainty quantification is often neglected, making such
approaches unreliable for crop monitoring applications. Inspired by
ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple,
model-agnostic sampling strategy that leverages growing degree days (GDD),
based on daily average temperature, to replace calendar time with thermal time.
By uniformly subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful domain,
the method emphasizes phenologically active growth stages while reducing
temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the method on a multi-year
Sentinel-2 dataset spanning all of Switzerland, training on one growing season
and testing on other seasons. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our
method delivers substantial gains in classification accuracy and, critically,
produces more calibrated uncertainty estimates. Notably, our method excels in
low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season
classification. With only 10 percent of the training data, our method surpasses
the state-of-the-art baseline in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty
estimation, and by the end of June, it achieves performance similar to a
baseline trained on the full season. These results demonstrate that leveraging
temperature data not only improves predictive performance across seasons but
also enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of crop-type mapping in
real-world applications.

Result: 在标准视频数据集上，该方法在重建质量和压缩性能上优于现有基于INR的视频表示方法。

Conclusion: SPPs方法有效解决了边界不连续问题，提升了神经视频表示的性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have attracted significant interest
for their ability to model complex signals by mapping spatial and temporal
coordinates to signal values. In the context of neural video representation,
several decoding strategies have been explored to balance compactness and
reconstruction quality, including pixel-wise, frame-wise, and patch-wise
methods. Patch-wise decoding aims to combine the flexibility of pixel-based
models with the efficiency of frame-based approaches. However, conventional
uniform patch division often leads to discontinuities at patch boundaries, as
independently reconstructed regions may fail to form a coherent global
structure. To address this limitation, we propose a neural video representation
method based on Structure-Preserving Patches (SPPs). Our approach rearranges
each frame into a set of spatially structured patch frames using a
PixelUnshuffle-like operation. This rearrangement maintains the spatial
coherence of the original frame while enabling patch-level decoding. The
network learns to predict these rearranged patch frames, which supports a
global-to-local fitting strategy and mitigates degradation caused by
upsampling. Experiments on standard video datasets show that the proposed
method improves reconstruction quality and compression performance compared to
existing INR-based video representation methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应采样显著优化了3DGS的性能，减少了对启发式规则的依赖，提升了灵活性和效率。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive sampling framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
that leverages comprehensive multi-view photometric error signals within a
unified Metropolis-Hastings approach. Traditional 3DGS methods heavily rely on
heuristic-based density-control mechanisms (e.g., cloning, splitting, and
pruning), which can lead to redundant computations or the premature removal of
beneficial Gaussians. Our framework overcomes these limitations by
reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process,
dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view
errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from
these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance
on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian
distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on
benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep
Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed,
enhancing computational efficiency while matching or modestly surpassing the
view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vascular structures in coronary angiography remains
a core challenge in medical image analysis due to the complexity of elongated,
thin, and low-contrast vessels. Classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
often fail to preserve topological continuity, while recent Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based models, although strong in global context modeling, lack precise
boundary awareness. In this work, we introduce BAVT, a Boundary-Aware Vision
Transformer, a ViT-based architecture enhanced with an edge-aware loss that
explicitly guides the segmentation toward fine-grained vascular boundaries.
Unlike hybrid transformer-CNN models, BAVT retains a minimal, scalable
structure that is fully compatible with large-scale vision foundation model
(VFM) pretraining. We validate our approach on the DCA-1 coronary angiography
dataset, where BAVT achieves superior performance across medical image
segmentation metrics outperforming both CNN and hybrid baselines. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining plain ViT encoders with
boundary-aware supervision for clinical-grade vascular segmentation.

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of transformers in medical applications, the
exploration of multi-scale learning through transformers remains limited, while
hierarchical representations are considered advantageous for computer-aided
medical diagnosis. We propose a novel hierarchical transformer model that
adeptly integrates the feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) with the advanced representational potential of Vision
Transformers (ViTs). Addressing the lack of inductive biases and dependence on
extensive training datasets in ViTs, our model employs a CNN backbone to
generate hierarchical visual representations. These representations are adapted
for transformer input through an innovative patch tokenization process,
preserving the inherited multi-scale inductive biases. We also introduce a
scale-wise attention mechanism that directly captures intra-scale and
inter-scale associations. This mechanism complements patch-wise attention by
enhancing spatial understanding and preserving global perception, which we
refer to as local and global attention, respectively. Our model significantly

*Xinyi Zhao,Congjing Zhang,Pei Guo,Wei Li,Lin Chen,Chaoyue Zhao,Shuai Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个专为智能家居场景设计的视频异常检测（VAD）基准SmartHome-Bench，包含1,203个视频，并提出Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain（TRLC）框架，显著提升检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAD基准未考虑智能家居场景的特殊性，需针对性评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的能力。

Method: 构建SmartHome-Bench基准，包含七类异常视频，并提出TRLC框架优化MLLMs的异常检测能力。

Result: 当前模型在VAD任务中表现有限，TRLC框架将检测准确率提升11.62%。

Conclusion: SmartHome-Bench填补了智能家居VAD的空白，TRLC框架为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security
by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD
benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios,
neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge
this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark
specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the
capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed
benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized
according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as
Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously
annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further
investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art
closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results
reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video
anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that
achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy. The benchmark
dataset and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的实时多人2D姿态估计模型，通过改进的解码器架构和关键点相似性度量，显著提升了训练效率和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏基于Transformer的实时多人姿态估计模型，该研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用改进的解码器架构和关键点相似性度量，生成正负查询以优化模型性能。

Result: 模型训练速度显著提升（减少5-10倍训练周期），推理时间具有竞争力，且无需量化库加速。

Conclusion: 提出的模型在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，参数更少，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Multi-person pose estimation (MPPE) estimates keypoints for all individuals
present in an image. MPPE is a fundamental task for several applications in
computer vision and virtual reality. Unfortunately, there are currently no
transformer-based models that can perform MPPE in real time. The paper presents
a family of transformer-based models capable of performing multi-person 2D pose
estimation in real-time. Our approach utilizes a modified decoder architecture
and keypoint similarity metrics to generate both positive and negative queries,
thereby enhancing the quality of the selected queries within the architecture.
Compared to state-of-the-art models, our proposed models train much faster,
using 5 to 10 times fewer epochs, with competitive inference times without
requiring quantization libraries to speed up the model. Furthermore, our
proposed models provide competitive results or outperform alternative models,
often using significantly fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildCAT3D是一个从多样化2D场景图像数据中学习生成新视角的框架，解决了场景级新视角合成的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 场景级新视角合成缺乏干净的多视角训练数据，而现有数据多样性不足或存在版权问题。WildCAT3D利用野外拍摄的多样化数据，解决了这一问题。

Method: 通过显式建模图像的全局外观条件，扩展了多视角扩散范式，从不同外观的场景视图中学习。

Result: WildCAT3D在单视角新视角合成中取得最先进成果，且训练数据需求少于先前方法，同时支持生成时的全局外观控制。

Conclusion: WildCAT3D为场景级新视角合成提供了高效解决方案，并扩展了生成控制能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in sparse novel view synthesis (NVS) applied to
object-centric scenes, scene-level NVS remains a challenge. A central issue is
the lack of available clean multi-view training data, beyond manually curated
datasets with limited diversity, camera variation, or licensing issues. On the
other hand, an abundance of diverse and permissively-licensed data exists in
the wild, consisting of scenes with varying appearances (illuminations,
transient occlusions, etc.) from sources such as tourist photos. To this end,
we present WildCAT3D, a framework for generating novel views of scenes learned
from diverse 2D scene image data captured in the wild. We unlock training on
these data sources by explicitly modeling global appearance conditions in
images, extending the state-of-the-art multi-view diffusion paradigm to learn
from scene views of varying appearances. Our trained model generalizes to new
scenes at inference time, enabling the generation of multiple consistent novel
views. WildCAT3D provides state-of-the-art results on single-view NVS in
object- and scene-level settings, while training on strictly less data sources
than prior methods. Additionally, it enables novel applications by providing
global appearance control during generation.

IBM i system (formerly and still more commonly known as AS/400). We introduce a
human-annotated dataset consisting of 1,050 system screen images, in which 381
images are screenshots of IBM i system screens in Japanese. Each image contains
multiple components, including text labels, text boxes, options, tables,

approaches using our dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset in constructing a system for component detection
from GUI screens. By automatically detecting GUI components from the screen,
AS400-DET has the potential to perform automated testing on systems that
operate via GUI screens.

Conclusion: HKD4VLM通过知识蒸馏和增强策略显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Driven by the rapid progress in vision-language models (VLMs), the
responsible behavior of large-scale multimodal models has become a prominent
research area, particularly focusing on hallucination detection and factuality
checking. In this paper, we present the solution for the two tracks of
Responsible AI challenge. Inspirations from the general domain demonstrate that
a smaller distilled VLM can often outperform a larger VLM that is directly
tuned on downstream tasks, while achieving higher efficiency. We thus jointly
tackle two tasks from the perspective of knowledge distillation and propose a
progressive hybrid knowledge distillation framework termed HKD4VLM.
Specifically, the overall framework can be decomposed into Pyramid-like
Progressive Online Distillation and Ternary-Coupled Refinement Distillation,
hierarchically moving from coarse-grained knowledge alignment to fine-grained
refinement. Besides, we further introduce the mapping shift-enhanced inference
and diverse augmentation strategies to enhance model performance and
robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
HKD4VLM. Ablation studies provide insights into the critical design choices
driving performance gains.

TL;DR: 论文综述了行人重识别（ReID）从手工特征到深度学习再到结合大语言模型（LLM）的发展历程，重点介绍了LLM如何通过自然语言提升视觉匹配效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决早期方法在光照、姿态和视角变化下的不足，并探索如何通过LLM整合语义和上下文信息以提升ReID性能。

Method: 利用GPT-4o生成动态、身份特定的文本描述，增强视觉-语言ReID系统中图像与文本的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，文本描述显著提高了准确性，尤其在复杂或模糊场景中。

Conclusion: 论文通过结合计算机视觉与自然语言处理，为ReID领域提供了统一视角，并指出未来研究方向如提示设计、跨模态迁移学习和实际适应性。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) has evolved from handcrafted feature-based
methods to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to models incorporating
large language models (LLMs). Early methods struggled with variations in
lighting, pose, and viewpoint, but deep learning addressed these issues by
learning robust visual features. Building on this, LLMs now enable ReID systems
to integrate semantic and contextual information through natural language. This
survey traces that full evolution and offers one of the first comprehensive
reviews of ReID approaches that leverage LLMs, where textual descriptions are
used as privileged information to improve visual matching. A key contribution
is the use of dynamic, identity-specific prompts generated by GPT-4o, which
enhance the alignment between images and text in vision-language ReID systems.
Experimental results show that these descriptions improve accuracy, especially
in complex or ambiguous cases. To support further research, we release a large
set of GPT-4o-generated descriptions for standard ReID datasets. By bridging
computer vision and natural language processing, this survey offers a unified
perspective on the field's development and outlines key future directions such
as better prompt design, cross-modal transfer learning, and real-world
adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动捕捉系统依赖物理标记，成本高且耗时；现有学习方法多为单人捕捉或难以处理遮挡和交互。

Method: 提出基于分割掩码的密集2D表面标志预测方法，利用可学习查询的架构处理遮挡和交互。

Result: 系统在复杂交互中表现优异，重建质量接近商业标记系统，无需手动清理。

Conclusion: MAMMA为无标记运动捕捉提供了高效解决方案，并公开数据集和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: We present MAMMA, a markerless motion-capture pipeline that accurately
recovers SMPL-X parameters from multi-view video of two-person interaction
sequences. Traditional motion-capture systems rely on physical markers.
Although they offer high accuracy, their requirements of specialized hardware,
manual marker placement, and extensive post-processing make them costly and
time-consuming. Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome these
limitations, but most are designed for single-person capture, rely on sparse
keypoints, or struggle with occlusions and physical interactions. In this work,
we introduce a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks conditioned on
segmentation masks, enabling person-specific correspondence estimation even
under heavy occlusion. We employ a novel architecture that exploits learnable
queries for each landmark. We demonstrate that our approach can handle complex
person--person interaction and offers greater accuracy than existing methods.
To train our network, we construct a large, synthetic multi-view dataset
combining human motions from diverse sources, including extreme poses, hand
motions, and close interactions. Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic
sequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X
ground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system
capable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach
offers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based
motion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup. Finally, we
address the absence of common benchmarks for dense-landmark prediction and
markerless motion capture by introducing two evaluation settings built from
real multi-view sequences. We will release our dataset, benchmark, method,
training code, and pre-trained model weights for research purposes.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个后解读辅助系统，通过区域级分析检测胸片中被忽略的异常区域，支持人机协作，减少AI过度依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸片诊断中常见的感知错误（如忽略可见异常）缺乏有效支持，现有工作流和AI系统在人机协作方面不足。

Method: RADAR结合放射科医生标注和胸片图像，进行区域分析，提供兴趣区域建议而非固定标签。

Result: 在模拟感知错误数据集上，RADAR召回率0.78，精确率0.44，F1分数0.56，区域定位准确（中位IoU 0.78）。

Conclusion: RADAR有效辅助放射科医生，提供灵活的建议，适合实际工作流，并开源了代码和数据。

Abstract: Chest radiography is widely used in diagnostic imaging. However, perceptual
errors -- especially overlooked but visible abnormalities -- remain common and
clinically significant. Current workflows and AI systems provide limited
support for detecting such errors after interpretation and often lack
meaningful human--AI collaboration. We introduce RADAR (Radiologist--AI
Diagnostic Assistance and Review), a post-interpretation companion system.
RADAR ingests finalized radiologist annotations and CXR images, then performs
regional-level analysis to detect and refer potentially missed abnormal
regions. The system supports a "second-look" workflow and offers suggested
regions of interest (ROIs) rather than fixed labels to accommodate
inter-observer variation. We evaluated RADAR on a simulated perceptual-error
dataset derived from de-identified CXR cases, using F1 score and Intersection
over Union (IoU) as primary metrics. RADAR achieved a recall of 0.78, precision
of 0.44, and an F1 score of 0.56 in detecting missed abnormalities in the
simulated perceptual-error dataset. Although precision is moderate, this
reduces over-reliance on AI by encouraging radiologist oversight in human--AI
collaboration. The median IoU was 0.78, with more than 90% of referrals
exceeding 0.5 IoU, indicating accurate regional localization. RADAR effectively
complements radiologist judgment, providing valuable post-read support for
perceptual-error detection in CXR interpretation. Its flexible ROI suggestions
and non-intrusive integration position it as a promising tool in real-world
radiology workflows. To facilitate reproducibility and further evaluation, we
release a fully open-source web implementation alongside a simulated error
dataset. All code, data, demonstration videos, and the application are publicly
available at https://github.com/avutukuri01/RADAR.

Motivation: 评估基础模型在晶体学推理中的表现需要能够隔离泛化行为并强制物理约束的基准。

Method: 引入了空间排除和成分排除两种评估协议，测试模型的空间插值和外推能力以及对化学组成的泛化能力。

Result: 通过九种视觉-语言基础模型的测试，评估了其生成的结构注释的准确性、物理一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 这些基准为评估大规模多模态模型的泛化性、一致性和可靠性提供了一个可重复且物理信息丰富的框架。

Abstract: Evaluating foundation models for crystallographic reasoning requires
benchmarks that isolate generalization behavior while enforcing physical
constraints. This work introduces a multiscale multicrystal dataset with two
physically grounded evaluation protocols to stress-test multimodal generative
models. The Spatial-Exclusion benchmark withholds all supercells of a given
radius from a diverse dataset, enabling controlled assessments of spatial
interpolation and extrapolation. The Compositional-Exclusion benchmark omits
all samples of a specific chemical composition, probing generalization across
stoichiometries. Nine vision--language foundation models are prompted with
crystallographic images and textual context to generate structural annotations.
Responses are evaluated via (i) relative errors in lattice parameters and
density, (ii) a physics-consistency index penalizing volumetric violations, and
(iii) a hallucination score capturing geometric outliers and invalid
space-group predictions. These benchmarks establish a reproducible, physically
informed framework for assessing generalization, consistency, and reliability
in large-scale multimodal models. Dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型在视觉生成中表现优异，但迭代采样导致推理速度慢。现有快速采样器通过高阶求解器减少离散化误差，但优化空间有限。论文重新审视采样误差，发现其包含离散化误差和近似误差，并探索两者之间的关系。

Method: 提出DualFast框架，采用双误差解耦策略，同时优化离散化误差和近似误差，无需额外训练即可加速采样。

Result: 实验表明，DualFast在极少数采样步骤下显著提升了采样质量和速度，适用于像素空间和潜在空间的DPMs。

Conclusion: DualFast为DPMs提供了一种高效、通用的加速方案，解决了现有采样器的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in
visual generation. While, they suffer from slow inference speed due to
iterative sampling. Employing fewer sampling steps is an intuitive solution,
but this will also introduces discretization error. Existing fast samplers make
inspiring efforts to reduce discretization error through the adoption of
high-order solvers, potentially reaching a plateau in terms of optimization.
This raises the question: can the sampling process be accelerated further? In
this paper, we re-examine the nature of sampling errors, discerning that they
comprise two distinct elements: the widely recognized discretization error and
the less explored approximation error. Our research elucidates the dynamics
between these errors and the step by implementing a dual-error disentanglement
strategy. Building on these foundations, we introduce an unified and
training-free acceleration framework, DualFast, designed to enhance the speed
of DPM sampling by concurrently accounting for both error types, thereby
minimizing the total sampling error. DualFast is seamlessly compatible with
existing samplers and significantly boost their sampling quality and speed,
particularly in extremely few sampling steps. We substantiate the effectiveness
of our framework through comprehensive experiments, spanning both unconditional
and conditional sampling domains, across both pixel-space and latent-space
DPMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理学基础模型缺乏WSI理解和临床数据训练，限制了其通用性。

Method: 两阶段训练：1. 视觉-语言模型对齐WSI嵌入与临床诊断文本；2. 解冻语言模型以提取临床表征。

Result: PRISM2在诊断和生物标志物预测任务中表现优异，超越现有模型。

Conclusion: PRISM2通过临床特征对齐，为通用病理AI提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent pathology foundation models can provide rich tile-level
representations but fall short of delivering general-purpose clinical utility
without further extensive model development. These models lack whole-slide
image (WSI) understanding and are not trained with large-scale diagnostic data,
limiting their performance on diverse downstream tasks. We introduce PRISM2, a
multi-modal slide-level foundation model trained via clinical dialogue to
enable scalable, generalizable pathology AI. PRISM2 is trained on nearly
700,000 specimens (2.3 million WSIs) paired with real-world clinical diagnostic
reports in a two-stage process. In Stage 1, a vision-language model is trained
using contrastive and captioning objectives to align whole slide embeddings
with textual clinical diagnosis. In Stage 2, the language model is unfrozen to
enable diagnostic conversation and extract more clinically meaningful
representations from hidden states. PRISM2 achieves strong performance on
diagnostic and biomarker prediction tasks, outperforming prior slide-level
models including PRISM and TITAN. It also introduces a zero-shot yes/no
classification approach that surpasses CLIP-style methods without prompt tuning
or class enumeration. By aligning visual features with clinical reasoning,
PRISM2 improves generalization on both data-rich and low-sample tasks, offering
a scalable path forward for building general pathology AI agents capable of
assisting diagnostic and prognostic decisions.

Motivation: 现有VIC方法主要采用一对一匹配策略，导致对行人外观变化或漏检敏感。本文提出放宽为一对多匹配，以更好地适应VIC任务并利用行人社交行为。

Method: 提出OMAN模型，包含隐式上下文生成器和一对多配对匹配器，通过O2M匹配策略解决行人对应问题。

Result: 在SenseCrowd和CroHD基准测试中，OMAN实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: OMAN通过O2M匹配策略显著提升了VIC任务的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Video Individual Counting (VIC) is a recently introduced task that aims to
estimate pedestrian flux from a video. It extends conventional Video Crowd
Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that
only learns to count repeated pedestrian patterns across frames, the key
problem of VIC is how to identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which
turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however,
mainly follow a one-to-one (O2O) matching strategy where the same pedestrian
must be exactly matched between frames, leading to sensitivity to appearance
variations or missing detections. In this work, we show that the O2O matching
could be relaxed to a one-to-many (O2M) matching problem, which better fits the
problem nature of VIC and can leverage the social grouping behavior of walking
pedestrians. We therefore introduce OMAN, a simple but effective VIC model with
implicit One-to-Many mAtchiNg, featuring an implicit context generator and a
one-to-many pairwise matcher. Experiments on the SenseCrowd and CroHD
benchmarks show that OMAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code is

TL;DR: SuperPlace通过结合经典特征聚合方法（如GeM和NetVLAD）和基础模型，提出了一种新的视觉地点识别（VPR）方法。包括监督标签对齐、G²M聚合方法和NetVLAD的二次微调策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR方法未能充分利用基础模型的潜力，且忽视了经典聚合方法的有效性。SuperPlace旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 1. 监督标签对齐实现多数据集统一训练；2. G²M聚合方法结合双GeM优化特征；3. NetVLAD-Linear的二次微调策略（FT²）。

Result: G²M在特征维度仅为现有方法十分之一时表现优异；NVL-FT²在MSLS排行榜上排名第一。

Conclusion: SuperPlace通过复兴经典方法并创新优化，显著提升了VPR性能，为领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent visual place recognition (VPR) approaches have leveraged foundation
models (FM) and introduced novel aggregation techniques. However, these methods
have failed to fully exploit key concepts of FM, such as the effective
utilization of extensive training sets, and they have overlooked the potential
of classical aggregation methods, such as GeM and NetVLAD. Building on these
insights, we revive classical feature aggregation methods and develop more
fundamental VPR models, collectively termed SuperPlace. First, we introduce a
supervised label alignment method that enables training across various VPR
datasets within a unified framework. Second, we propose G$^2$M, a compact
feature aggregation method utilizing two GeMs, where one GeM learns the
principal components of feature maps along the channel dimension and calibrates
the output of the other. Third, we propose the secondary fine-tuning (FT$^2$)
strategy for NetVLAD-Linear (NVL). NetVLAD first learns feature vectors in a
high-dimensional space and then compresses them into a lower-dimensional space
via a single linear layer. Extensive experiments highlight our contributions
and demonstrate the superiority of SuperPlace. Specifically, G$^2$M achieves
promising results with only one-tenth of the feature dimensions compared to
recent methods. Moreover, NVL-FT$^2$ ranks first on the MSLS leaderboard.

Abstract: Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing
temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos,
utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises
due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to
incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we
present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised
Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode
both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and
language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an
anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby
yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory
bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions
associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's
expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates
remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two
benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型重建方法因原型数量有限导致正常信息聚合不足，且增加原型可能因注意力机制使异常被重建（软身份映射问题）。

Method: 引入扩展的可学习原型集和动态双向解码器，结合原型约束防止异常重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Pro-AD实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Pro-AD在多类无监督异常检测任务中表现出卓越的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection
utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates
insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction.
However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well
reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft
Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these
issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly
detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable
prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we
employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the
normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via
prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more
comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image
features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its
contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive
prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well
reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention
mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within
the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further
improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art
performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness
for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于2D高斯泼溅（2DGS）的新方法GS-2DGS，用于高反射物体的3D建模，结合了高速渲染和几何约束，显著优于现有高斯技术，并接近SDF方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高反射物体的3D建模因强视角依赖性而困难，现有方法（如SDF）耗时且表面过平滑，而3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）虽快速但几何约束不足导致噪声。

Method: 结合2D高斯泼溅（2DGS）的快速渲染能力和基础模型的几何信息，提出GS-2DGS方法。

Conclusion: GS-2DGS在高反射物体建模中实现了速度与质量的平衡，为相关领域提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D modeling of highly reflective objects remains challenging due to strong
view-dependent appearances. While previous SDF-based methods can recover
high-quality meshes, they are often time-consuming and tend to produce
over-smoothed surfaces. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers the
advantage of high speed and detailed real-time rendering, but extracting
surfaces from the Gaussians can be noisy due to the lack of geometric
constraints. To bridge the gap between these approaches, we propose a novel
reconstruction method called GS-2DGS for reflective objects based on 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). Our approach combines the rapid rendering
capabilities of Gaussian Splatting with additional geometric information from
foundation models. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms Gaussian-based techniques
in terms of reconstruction and relighting and achieves performance comparable
to SDF-based methods while being an order of magnitude faster. Code is

Motivation: MLLMs常生成与视觉内容不符的幻觉输出，需细粒度检测以全面评估。

Method: 提出ZINA方法，细粒度识别幻觉、分类错误类型并提供修正建议，构建VisionHall数据集。

Result: ZINA在检测和编辑任务中优于GPT-4o和LLama-3.2。

Conclusion: ZINA为MLLMs幻觉问题提供了有效的细粒度解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often generate hallucinations, where
the output deviates from the visual content. Given that these hallucinations
can take diverse forms, detecting hallucinations at a fine-grained level is
essential for comprehensive evaluation and analysis. To this end, we propose a
novel task of multimodal fine-grained hallucination detection and editing for
MLLMs. Moreover, we propose ZINA, a novel method that identifies hallucinated
spans at a fine-grained level, classifies their error types into six
categories, and suggests appropriate refinements. To train and evaluate models
for this task, we constructed VisionHall, a dataset comprising 6.9k outputs
from twelve MLLMs manually annotated by 211 annotators, and 20k synthetic
samples generated using a graph-based method that captures dependencies among
error types. We demonstrated that ZINA outperformed existing methods, including
GPT-4o and LLama-3.2, in both detection and editing tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于混合特征（MoF）的简单重排序方法，通过多度量损失函数优化全局特征，在视觉地点识别（VPR）任务中提升了性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有VPR方法依赖局部特征或运动序列，存在局限性，因此需要一种更高效且不依赖局部特征设计的方法。

Method: 提出MoF方法，结合GPS标签、时间戳等约束条件，通过学习计算权重优化全局特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上显著提升性能，如Pitts-30k测试集上仅增加25KB参数和10微秒处理时间，性能提升0.9%。

Conclusion: MoF方法在VPR任务中高效且有效，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a scene-oriented image retrieval problem in
computer vision in which re-ranking based on local features is commonly
employed to improve performance. In robotics, VPR is also referred to as Loop
Closure Detection, which emphasizes spatial-temporal verification within a
sequence. However, designing local features specifically for VPR is
impractical, and relying on motion sequences imposes limitations. Inspired by
these observations, we propose a novel, simple re-ranking method that refines
global features through a Mixture-of-Features (MoF) approach under embodied
constraints. First, we analyze the practical feasibility of embodied
constraints in VPR and categorize them according to existing datasets, which
include GPS tags, sequential timestamps, local feature matching, and
self-similarity matrices. We then propose a learning-based MoF
weight-computation approach, utilizing a multi-metric loss function.
Experiments demonstrate that our method improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on public datasets with minimal additional computational overhead.
For instance, with only 25 KB of additional parameters and a processing time of
10 microseconds per frame, our method achieves a 0.9\% improvement over a
DINOv2-based baseline performance on the Pitts-30k test set.

Motivation: 现有方法在长时程驾驶视频生成中存在误差累积和特征错位问题，主要由于时空动态解耦不足和跨帧特征传播机制有限。

Method: 提出分层时序特征传递（HTFT）和多阶段训练策略，分别建模时序和去噪过程，并通过特征传递增强帧间一致性。

Conclusion: STAGE通过HTFT和多阶段训练策略，成功解决了长时程驾驶视频生成的挑战，展现了其高效性和扩展性。

Abstract: The generation of temporally consistent, high-fidelity driving videos over
extended horizons presents a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving world
modeling. Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature
misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and
limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these
limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine),
a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature
coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To
achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce
Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training
strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout
the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process
separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage
training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model
decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby
accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on
the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing
methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also
explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We
generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset,
which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.

Conclusion: StgcDiff通过捕捉手语的时空依赖性，有效生成平滑过渡视频，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Sign language transition generation seeks to convert discrete sign language
segments into continuous sign videos by synthesizing smooth transitions.
However,most existing methods merely concatenate isolated signs, resulting in
poor visual coherence and semantic accuracy in the generated videos. Unlike
textual languages,sign language is inherently rich in spatial-temporal cues,
making it more complex to model. To address this,we propose StgcDiff, a
graph-based conditional diffusion framework that generates smooth transitions
between discrete signs by capturing the unique spatial-temporal dependencies of
sign language. Specifically, we first train an encoder-decoder architecture to
learn a structure-aware representation of spatial-temporal skeleton sequences.
Next, we optimize a diffusion denoiser conditioned on the representations
learned by the pre-trained encoder, which is tasked with predicting transition
frames from noise. Additionally, we design the Sign-GCN module as the key
component in our framework, which effectively models the spatial-temporal
features. Extensive experiments conducted on the PHOENIX14T, USTC-CSL100,and
USTC-SLR500 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Result: 实验表明，GreedyPrune在多模态任务和模型中实现了最先进的准确性，同时显著降低了端到端推理延迟。

Conclusion: GreedyPrune是一种高效且无需训练的解决方案，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Although Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in image understanding tasks, their computational efficiency
remains a significant challenge, particularly on resource-constrained devices
due to the high cost of processing large numbers of visual tokens. Recently,
training-free visual token pruning methods have gained popularity as a low-cost
solution to this issue. However, existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: semantic saliency-based strategies primarily focus on high
cross-attention visual tokens, often neglecting visual diversity, whereas
visual diversity-based methods risk inadvertently discarding semantically
important tokens, especially under high compression ratios. In this paper, we
introduce GreedyPrune, a training-free plug-and-play visual token pruning
algorithm designed to jointly optimize semantic saliency and visual diversity.
We formalize the token pruning process as a combinatorial optimization problem
and demonstrate that greedy algorithms effectively balance computational
efficiency with model accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing that GreedyPrune achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy across various multimodal tasks and models while
significantly reducing end-to-end inference latency.

Conclusion: MT-PCR通过结合Mamba和Transformer，解决了点云配准中的计算效率和信息损失问题，表现优异。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision
and robotics. Most existing learning-based PCR methods rely on Transformers,
which suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This limitation restricts
the resolution of point clouds that can be processed, inevitably leading to
information loss. In contrast, Mamba-a recently proposed model based on state
space models (SSMs)-achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining
strong long-range contextual modeling capabilities. However, directly applying
Mamba to PCR tasks yields suboptimal performance due to the unordered and
irregular nature of point cloud data. To address this challenge, we propose
MT-PCR, the first point cloud registration framework that integrates both Mamba
and Transformer modules. Specifically, we serialize point cloud features using
Z-order space-filling curves to enforce spatial locality, enabling Mamba to
better model the geometric structure of the input. Additionally, we remove the
order indicator module commonly used in Mamba-based sequence modeling, leads to
improved performance in our setting. The serialized features are then processed
by an optimized Mamba encoder, followed by a Transformer refinement stage.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MT-PCR
outperforms Transformer-based and concurrent state-of-the-art methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, significantly reducing while GPU memory usage and
FLOPs.

Abstract: Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and

While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D

in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This
survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for

Conclusion: DVP-MVS++通过几何一致性和可见性感知，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Recently, patch deformation-based methods have demonstrated significant
effectiveness in multi-view stereo due to their incorporation of deformable and
expandable perception for reconstructing textureless areas. However, these
methods generally focus on identifying reliable pixel correlations to mitigate
matching ambiguity of patch deformation, while neglecting the deformation
instability caused by edge-skipping and visibility occlusions, which may cause
potential estimation deviations. To address these issues, we propose DVP-MVS++,
an innovative approach that synergizes both depth-normal-edge aligned and
harmonized cross-view priors for robust and visibility-aware patch deformation.
Specifically, to avoid edge-skipping, we first apply DepthPro, Metric3Dv2 and
Roberts operator to generate coarse depth maps, normal maps and edge maps,
respectively. These maps are then aligned via an erosion-dilation strategy to
produce fine-grained homogeneous boundaries for facilitating robust patch
deformation. Moreover, we reformulate view selection weights as visibility
maps, and then implement both an enhanced cross-view depth reprojection and an
area-maximization strategy to help reliably restore visible areas and
effectively balance deformed patch, thus acquiring harmonized cross-view priors
for visibility-aware patch deformation. Additionally, we obtain geometry
consistency by adopting both aggregated normals via view selection and
projection depth differences via epipolar lines, and then employ SHIQ for
highlight correction to enable geometry consistency with highlight-aware
perception, thus improving reconstruction quality during propagation and
refinement stage. Evaluation results on ETH3D, Tanks & Temples and Strecha
datasets exhibit the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization
capability of our proposed method.

Conclusion: SASep通过改进几何和特征表示，有效区分已知和未知类别。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have greatly enhanced 3D object
recognition, but most models are limited to closed-set scenarios, unable to
handle unknown samples in real-world applications. Open-set recognition (OSR)
addresses this limitation by enabling models to both classify known classes and
identify novel classes. However, current OSR methods rely on global features to
differentiate known and unknown classes, treating the entire object uniformly
and overlooking the varying semantic importance of its different parts. To
address this gap, we propose Salience-Aware Structured Separation (SASep),
which includes (i) a tunable semantic decomposition (TSD) module to
semantically decompose objects into important and unimportant parts, (ii) a
geometric synthesis strategy (GSS) to generate pseudo-unknown objects by
combining these unimportant parts, and (iii) a synth-aided margin separation
(SMS) module to enhance feature-level separation by expanding the feature
distributions between classes. Together, these components improve both
geometric and feature representations, enhancing the model's ability to
effectively distinguish known and unknown classes. Experimental results show
that SASep achieves superior performance in 3D OSR, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Facial texture generation is crucial for high-fidelity 3D face reconstruction
from a single image. However, existing methods struggle to generate UV albedo
maps with high-frequency details. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
end-to-end coarse-to-fine approach for UV albedo map generation. Our method
first utilizes a UV Albedo Parametric Model (UVAPM), driven by low-dimensional
coefficients, to generate coarse albedo maps with skin tones and low-frequency
texture details. To capture high-frequency details, we train a detail generator
using a decoupled albedo map dataset, producing high-resolution albedo maps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-fidelity
textures from a single image, outperforming existing methods in terms of
texture quality and realism. The code and pre-trained model are publicly
available at https://github.com/MVIC-DAI/UVAPM, facilitating reproducibility

Conclusion: 解耦表示学习能显著提升世界模型的时空预测准确性。

Abstract: World models are critical for autonomous driving to simulate environmental
dynamics and generate synthetic data. Existing methods struggle to disentangle
ego-vehicle motion (perspective shifts) from scene evolvement (agent
interactions), leading to suboptimal predictions. Instead, we propose to
separate environmental changes from ego-motion by leveraging the scene-centric
coordinate systems. In this paper, we introduce COME: a framework that
integrates scene-centric forecasting Control into the Occupancy world ModEl.
Specifically, COME first generates ego-irrelevant, spatially consistent future
features through a scene-centric prediction branch, which are then converted
into scene condition using a tailored ControlNet. These condition features are
subsequently injected into the occupancy world model, enabling more accurate
and controllable future occupancy predictions. Experimental results on the
nuScenes-Occ3D dataset show that COME achieves consistent and significant
improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across diverse
configurations, including different input sources (ground-truth, camera-based,
fusion-based occupancy) and prediction horizons (3s and 8s). For example, under
the same settings, COME achieves 26.3% better mIoU metric than DOME and 23.7%
better mIoU metric than UniScene. These results highlight the efficacy of
disentangled representation learning in enhancing spatio-temporal prediction
fidelity for world models. Code and videos will be available at

finetuning process trains these modules using a multiclass classification as
the supervision.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate intraoperative X-ray/CT registration is essential for
surgical navigation in orthopedic procedures. However, existing methods
struggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under
broad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work
aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT
registration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed
registration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest
point (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone
contours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on
matching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone
substructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in
a more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only
two X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute
a dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image
poses and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method
is evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The
method consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm
compared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.
Furthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully
automatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient
solution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which
can be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration
accuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative
navigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in
computer-assisted surgery (CAS).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏见缓解方法在调整目标属性时往往会改变非目标属性，导致不希望的分布偏移。

Method: EFA通过随机采样目标属性并调整交叉注意力层，实现公平分布，同时保留非目标属性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have
enabled the generation of high-quality and photorealistic images from text
descriptions. However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender,
race, and socioeconomic status, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and
shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation
methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement,
where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes)
unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target
attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this
challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that
accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, Asian, and
Indian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background details)
during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target
attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected
layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of
target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms
existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes,
thereby maintaining the output distribution and generation capability of the
original model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练扩散模型的一步式点编辑方法AttentionDrag，利用自注意力机制实现高效且语义一致的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点编辑方法效率低或忽略语义关系，而预训练扩散模型的潜力未被充分利用。

Method: 利用DDIM反演过程中U-Net模块的自注意力机制知识，自动识别并调整相关图像区域，同时自适应生成掩码指导编辑。

Result: 性能优于现有方法，速度更快，提供高效且语义一致的编辑效果。

Conclusion: AttentionDrag为点编辑任务提供了更高效、语义一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional point-based image editing methods rely on iterative latent
optimization or geometric transformations, which are either inefficient in
their processing or fail to capture the semantic relationships within the
image. These methods often overlook the powerful yet underutilized image
editing capabilities inherent in pre-trained diffusion models. In this work, we
propose a novel one-step point-based image editing method, named AttentionDrag,
which leverages the inherent latent knowledge and feature correlations within
pre-trained diffusion models for image editing tasks. This framework enables
semantic consistency and high-quality manipulation without the need for
extensive re-optimization or retraining. Specifically, we reutilize the latent
correlations knowledge learned by the self-attention mechanism in the U-Net
module during the DDIM inversion process to automatically identify and adjust
relevant image regions, ensuring semantic validity and consistency.
Additionally, AttentionDrag adaptively generates masks to guide the editing
process, enabling precise and context-aware modifications with friendly
interaction. Our results demonstrate a performance that surpasses most
state-of-the-art methods with significantly faster speeds, showing a more
efficient and semantically coherent solution for point-based image editing
tasks.

Method: 比较了全模型微调和参数高效方法（如LoRA），分别针对UNet扩散主干和文本编码器组件。

Conclusion: 为将基础模型适应于非自然图像领域提供了系统方法。

Abstract: This work investigates the adaptation of large pre-trained latent diffusion
models to a radically new imaging domain: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). While
these generative models, originally trained on natural images, demonstrate
impressive capabilities in text-to-image synthesis, they are not natively
adapted to represent SAR data, which involves different physics, statistical
distributions, and visual characteristics. Using a sizeable SAR dataset (on the
order of 100,000 to 1 million images), we address the fundamental question of
fine-tuning such models for this unseen modality. We explore and compare
multiple fine-tuning strategies, including full model fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), focusing
separately on the UNet diffusion backbone and the text encoder components. To
evaluate generative quality, we combine several metrics: statistical distance
from real SAR distributions, textural similarity via GLCM descriptors, and
semantic alignment assessed with a CLIP model fine-tuned on SAR data. Our
results show that a hybrid tuning strategy yields the best performance: full
fine-tuning of the UNet is better at capturing low-level SAR-specific patterns,
while LoRA-based partial tuning of the text encoder, combined with embedding
learning of the <SAR> token, suffices to preserve prompt alignment. This work
provides a methodical strategy for adapting foundation models to unconventional
imaging modalities beyond natural image domains.

Conclusion: TA²Net在可听动作时间定位任务中表现优异，且具有跨领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Audible Action Temporal Localization, which aims to
identify the spatio-temporal coordinates of audible movements. Unlike
conventional tasks such as action recognition and temporal action localization,
which broadly analyze video content, our task focuses on the distinct kinematic
dynamics of audible actions. It is based on the premise that key actions are
driven by inflectional movements; for example, collisions that produce sound
often involve abrupt changes in motion. To capture this, we propose
$TA^{2}Net$, a novel architecture that estimates inflectional flow using the
second derivative of motion to determine collision timings without relying on
audio input. $TA^{2}Net$ also integrates a self-supervised spatial localization
strategy during training, combining contrastive learning with spatial analysis.
This dual design improves temporal localization accuracy and simultaneously
identifies sound sources within video frames. To support this task, we
introduce a new benchmark dataset, $Audible623$, derived from Kinetics and
UCF101 by removing non-essential vocalization subsets. Extensive experiments
confirm the effectiveness of our approach on $Audible623$ and show strong
generalizability to other domains, such as repetitive counting and sound source
localization. Code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态模态选择和知识蒸馏，有效提升了少样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Owing to its rapid progress and broad application prospects, few-shot action
recognition has attracted considerable interest. However, current methods are
predominantly based on limited single-modal data, which does not fully exploit
the potential of multimodal information. This paper presents a novel framework
that actively identifies reliable modalities for each sample using
task-specific contextual cues, thus significantly improving recognition
performance. Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module,
which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on
posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike
reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based
preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an
active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of
less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones.
Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher
weights to reliable modalities. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches.

Conclusion: DpRVI为葡萄园监测提供了新视角，支持可持续农业管理，符合PNRR-NODES项目的目标。

Abstract: Multi-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology has gained
increasing attention in agriculture, offering unique capabilities for
monitoring vegetation dynamics thanks to its all-weather, day-and-night
operation and high revisit frequency. This study presents, for the first time,
a comprehensive analysis combining dual-polarimetric radar vegetation index
(DpRVI) with optical indices to characterize vineyard crops. Vineyards exhibit
distinct non-isotropic scattering behavior due to their pronounced row
orientation, making them particularly challenging and interesting targets for
remote sensing. The research further investigates the relationship between
DpRVI and optical vegetation indices, demonstrating the complementary nature of
their information. We demonstrate that DpRVI and optical indices provide
complementary information, with low correlation suggesting that they capture
distinct vineyard features. Key findings reveal a parabolic trend in DpRVI over
the growing season, potentially linked to biomass dynamics estimated via the
Winkler Index. Unlike optical indices reflecting vegetation greenness, DpRVI
appears more directly related to biomass growth, aligning with specific
phenological phases. Preliminary results also highlight the potential of DpRVI
for distinguishing vineyards from other crops. This research aligns with the
objectives of the PNRR-NODES project, which promotes nature-based solutions
(NbS) for sustainable vineyard management. The application of DpRVI for
monitoring vineyards is part of integrating remote sensing techniques into the
broader field of strategies for climate-related change adaptation and risk
reduction, emphasizing the role of innovative SAR-based monitoring in
sustainable agriculture.

Motivation: 传统葡萄品种识别方法（如形态学和分子分析）存在主观性和高成本问题，而现有深度学习方法因数据集小依赖迁移学习，导致性能下降。自监督学习（SSL）可避免这些问题。

Method: 研究使用MAE对43个葡萄品种的田间图像进行自监督预训练，并比较了不同模型和训练策略的性能，包括预训练时长、数据增强方法和掩码比例的影响。

Result: MAE预训练的ViT-B/16模型表现最佳（F1=0.7956），预训练模型在小数据训练和简单数据增强下表现优异，掩码比例对性能影响较小。

Conclusion: MAE在农业图像分类中具有潜力，尤其在数据稀缺时表现优异，且简单数据增强方法更有效。

Abstract: Grapevine varieties are essential for the economies of many wine-producing
countries, influencing the production of wine, juice, and the consumption of
fruits and leaves. Traditional identification methods, such as ampelography and
molecular analysis, have limitations: ampelography depends on expert knowledge
and is inherently subjective, while molecular methods are costly and
time-intensive. To address these limitations, recent studies have applied deep
learning (DL) models to classify grapevine varieties using image data. However,
due to the small dataset sizes, these methods often depend on transfer learning
from datasets from other domains, e.g., ImageNet1K (IN1K), which can lead to
performance degradation due to domain shift and supervision collapse. In this
context, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods can be a good tool to avoid
this performance degradation, since they can learn directly from data, without
external labels. This study presents an evaluation of Masked Autoencoders
(MAEs) for identifying grapevine varieties based on field-acquired images. The
main contributions of this study include two benchmarks comprising 43 grapevine
varieties collected across different seasons, an analysis of MAE's application
in the agricultural context, and a performance comparison of trained models
across seasons. Our results show that a ViT-B/16 model pre-trained with MAE and
the unlabeled dataset achieved an F1 score of 0.7956, outperforming all other
models. Additionally, we observed that pre-trained models benefit from long
pre-training, perform well under low-data training regime, and that simple data
augmentation methods are more effective than complex ones. The study also found
that the mask ratio in MAE impacts performance only marginally.

Abstract: Video face restoration faces a critical challenge in maintaining temporal
consistency while recovering fine facial details from degraded inputs. This
paper presents a novel approach that extends Vector-Quantized Variational
Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), pretrained on static high-quality portraits, into a
video restoration framework through variational latent space modeling. Our key
innovation lies in reformulating discrete codebook representations as
Dirichlet-distributed continuous variables, enabling probabilistic transitions
between facial features across frames. A spatio-temporal Transformer
architecture jointly models inter-frame dependencies and predicts latent
distributions, while a Laplacian-constrained reconstruction loss combined with
perceptual (LPIPS) regularization enhances both pixel accuracy and visual
quality. Comprehensive evaluations on blind face restoration, video inpainting,
and facial colorization tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. This
work establishes an effective paradigm for adapting intensive image priors,
pretrained on high-quality images, to video restoration while addressing the
critical challenge of flicker artifacts. The source code has been open-sourced
and is available at https://github.com/fudan-generative-vision/DicFace.

<details>

Motivation: 当前单目深度估计方法中，度量深度估计（MMDE）受限于特定领域，而相对深度估计（MRDE）虽泛化性强但尺度不确定。本文旨在解决尺度不确定性，实现相对深度到度量深度的转换。

Result: TR2M在多个领域数据集上表现优异，并展现出强大的零样本能力。

Conclusion: TR2M展示了语言辅助下像素级相对深度转换为度量深度的巨大潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a generalizable framework to transfer relative depth to
metric depth. Current monocular depth estimation methods are mainly divided
into metric depth estimation (MMDE) and relative depth estimation (MRDE). MMDEs
estimate depth in metric scale but are often limited to a specific domain.
MRDEs generalize well across different domains, but with uncertain scales which
hinders downstream applications. To this end, we aim to build up a framework to
solve scale uncertainty and transfer relative depth to metric depth. Previous
methods used language as input and estimated two factors for conducting
rescaling. Our approach, TR2M, utilizes both text description and image as
inputs and estimates two rescale maps to transfer relative depth to metric
depth at pixel level. Features from two modalities are fused with a
cross-modality attention module to better capture scale information. A strategy
is designed to construct and filter confident pseudo metric depth for more
comprehensive supervision. We also develop scale-oriented contrastive learning
to utilize depth distribution as guidance to enforce the model learning about
intrinsic knowledge aligning with the scale distribution. TR2M only exploits a
small number of trainable parameters to train on datasets in various domains
and experiments not only demonstrate TR2M's great performance in seen datasets
but also reveal superior zero-shot capabilities on five unseen datasets. We
show the huge potential in pixel-wise transferring relative depth to metric
depth with language assistance. (Code is available at:

Conclusion: 该框架为零样本成像逆问题提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in imaging inverse problems
owing to their powerful generative capabilities. However, existing approaches
typically rely on models trained for specific degradation types, limiting their
generalizability to various degradation scenarios. To address this limitation,
we propose a zero-shot framework capable of handling various imaging inverse
problems without model retraining. We introduce a likelihood-guided noise
refinement mechanism that derives a closed-form approximation of the likelihood
score, simplifying score estimation and avoiding expensive gradient
computations. This estimated score is subsequently utilized to refine the
model-predicted noise, thereby better aligning the restoration process with the
generative framework of diffusion models. In addition, we integrate the
Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) sampling strategy to further improve
inference efficiency. The proposed mechanism can be applied to both
optimization-based and sampling-based schemes, providing an effective and
flexible zero-shot solution for imaging inverse problems. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
inverse problems, particularly in compressive sensing, delivering high-quality
reconstructions even at an extremely low sampling rate (5%).

Abstract: Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of
accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method
that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate
remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust
uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies
systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can
be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on
an established Dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two
new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly,
our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a
bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for
clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting
medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available

Conclusion: SelfToF和SelfToF*是高效且有效的深度增强方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Depth map enhancement using paired high-resolution RGB images offers a
cost-effective solution for improving low-resolution depth data from
lightweight ToF sensors. Nevertheless, naively adopting a depth estimation
pipeline to fuse the two modalities requires groundtruth depth maps for
supervision. To address this, we propose a self-supervised learning framework,
SelfToF, which generates detailed and scale-aware depth maps. Starting from an
image-based self-supervised depth estimation pipeline, we add low-resolution
depth as inputs, design a new depth consistency loss, propose a scale-recovery
module, and finally obtain a large performance boost. Furthermore, since the
ToF signal sparsity varies in real-world applications, we upgrade SelfToF to
SelfToF* with submanifold convolution and guided feature fusion. Consequently,
SelfToF* maintain robust performance across varying sparsity levels in ToF
data. Overall, our proposed method is both efficient and effective, as verified
by extensive experiments on the NYU and ScanNet datasets. The code will be made
public.

Conclusion: 该方法在遮挡条件下显著提升了面部年龄估计的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Facial age estimation has achieved considerable success under controlled
conditions. However, in unconstrained real-world scenarios, which are often
referred to as 'in the wild', age estimation remains challenging, especially
when faces are partially occluded, which may obscure their visibility. To
address this limitation, we propose a new approach integrating generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and transformer architectures to enable robust age
estimation from occluded faces. We employ an SN-Patch GAN to effectively remove
occlusions, while an Attentive Residual Convolution Module (ARCM), paired with
a Swin Transformer, enhances feature representation. Additionally, we introduce
a Multi-Task Age Head (MTAH) that combines regression and distribution
learning, further improving age estimation under occlusion. Experimental
results on the FG-NET, UTKFace, and MORPH datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques for occluded
facial age estimation by achieving an MAE of $3.00$, $4.54$, and $2.53$ years,
respectively.

Advancements in modern deep learning-based methods accelerated in 2022 with the

tracking. Our survey provides an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based MOT
methods, systematically categorizing tracking-by-detection approaches into five
groups: joint detection and embedding, heuristic-based, motion-based, affinity
learning, and offline methods. In addition, we examine end-to-end tracking
methods and compare them with existing alternative approaches. We evaluate the
performance of recent trackers across multiple benchmarks and specifically
assess their generality by comparing results across different domains. Our
findings indicate that heuristic-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results
on densely populated datasets with linear object motion, while deep
learning-based association methods, in both tracking-by-detection and
end-to-end approaches, excel in scenarios with complex motion patterns.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态图像缺乏运动线索，但识别人类活动对索引、安全和辅助应用至关重要。

Method: 使用285张MSCOCO图像（标注为行走、跑步、坐和站立），先训练CNN（41%准确率），再微调多模态CLIP模型。

TL;DR: SA-LUT结合了LUT的高效性和神经网络的适应性，通过空间自适应的4D LUT实现精确的颜色转换，同时保持结构完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在风格保真度和内容完整性之间存在权衡，SA-LUT旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出Style-guided 4D LUT Generator和Context Generator，通过多尺度特征提取和内容-风格交叉注意力实现空间自适应调整。

Result: SA-LUT在LPIPS评分上比3D LUT方法降低66.7%，视频风格化实时性能达16 FPS。

Conclusion: SA-LUT在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，并提供了首个PST评估基准PST50。

Abstract: Photorealistic style transfer (PST) enables real-world color grading by
adapting reference image colors while preserving content structure. Existing
methods mainly follow either approaches: generation-based methods that
prioritize stylistic fidelity at the cost of content integrity and efficiency,
or global color transformation methods such as LUT, which preserve structure
but lack local adaptability. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatial Adaptive 4D
Look-Up Table (SA-LUT), combining LUT efficiency with neural network
adaptability. SA-LUT features: (1) a Style-guided 4D LUT Generator that
extracts multi-scale features from the style image to predict a 4D LUT, and (2)
a Context Generator using content-style cross-attention to produce a context
map. This context map enables spatially-adaptive adjustments, allowing our 4D
LUT to apply precise color transformations while preserving structural
integrity. To establish a rigorous evaluation framework for photorealistic
style transfer, we introduce PST50, the first benchmark specifically designed
for PST assessment. Experiments demonstrate that SA-LUT substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 66.7% reduction in LPIPS
score compared to 3D LUT approaches, while maintaining real-time performance at
16 FPS for video stylization. Our code and benchmark are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小尺度PCB图像分辨率低，缺陷与噪声易混淆，需改进检测方法。

Result: 框架能有效保留结构细节，使微小缺陷在增强图像中仍可区分。

Conclusion: ESRPCB框架显著提升了PCB缺陷检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are critical components in modern electronics,
which require stringent quality control to ensure proper functionality.
However, the detection of defects in small-scale PCBs images poses significant
challenges as a result of the low resolution of the captured images, leading to
potential confusion between defects and noise. To overcome these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel framework, named ESRPCB (edgeguided
super-resolution for PCBs defect detection), which combines edgeguided
super-resolution with ensemble learning to enhance PCBs defect detection. The
framework leverages the edge information to guide the EDSR (Enhanced Deep
Super-Resolution) model with a novel ResCat (Residual Concatenation) structure,
enabling it to reconstruct high-resolution images from small PCBs inputs. By
incorporating edge features, the super-resolution process preserves critical
structural details, ensuring that tiny defects remain distinguishable in the
enhanced image. Following this, a multi-modal defect detection model employs
ensemble learning to analyze the super-resolved

Result: 在PRISMA地球观测任务中验证了方法的有效性，生成的合成丰度图具有自然场景的空间和光谱特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为超光谱分析提供了一种高效、无监督的丰度图生成工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for generating realistic abundance
maps from hyperspectral imagery using an unsupervised, deep-learning-driven
approach. Our framework integrates blind linear hyperspectral unmixing with
state-of-the-art diffusion models to enhance the realism and diversity of
synthetic abundance maps. First, we apply blind unmixing to extract endmembers
and abundance maps directly from raw hyperspectral data. These abundance maps
then serve as inputs to a diffusion model, which acts as a generative engine to
synthesize highly realistic spatial distributions. Diffusion models have
recently revolutionized image synthesis by offering superior performance,
flexibility, and stability, making them well-suited for high-dimensional
spectral data. By leveraging this combination of physically interpretable
unmixing and deep generative modeling, our approach enables the simulation of
hyperspectral sensor outputs under diverse imaging conditions--critical for
data augmentation, algorithm benchmarking, and model evaluation in
hyperspectral analysis. Notably, our method is entirely unsupervised, ensuring
adaptability to different datasets without the need for labeled training data.
We validate our approach using real hyperspectral imagery from the PRISMA space
mission for Earth observation, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing
realistic synthetic abundance maps that capture the spatial and spectral
characteristics of natural scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SDF的框架GeoSDF，用于高效准确地自动生成几何图形，并通过自验证确保数学准确性和视觉合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动生成几何图形的方法计算成本高，而基于学习的方法在真实性和准确性上存在不足。

Method: 使用SDF表示几何元素，构建约束函数优化，并通过渲染生成图形。定义符号语言简化表示和验证。

Result: 生成了高中和IMO级别的几何图形，合成过程简单高效，解决问题准确率高达95%。

Conclusion: GeoSDF为几何图形的生成提供了更先进、准确和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Plane Geometry Diagram Synthesis has been a crucial task in computer
graphics, with applications ranging from educational tools to AI-driven
mathematical reasoning. Traditionally, we rely on computer tools (e.g.,
Matplotlib and GeoGebra) to manually generate precise diagrams, but it usually
requires huge, complicated calculations cost. Recently, researchers start to
work on learning-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion and GPT4) to
automatically generate diagrams, saving operational cost but usually suffering
from limited realism and insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework GeoSDF to automatically generate diagrams efficiently and
accurately with Signed Distance Field (SDF). Specifically, we first represent
geometric elements in the SDF, then construct a series of constraint functions
to represent geometric relationships, next we optimize such constraint
functions to get an optimized field of both elements and constraints, finally
by rendering the optimized field, we can obtain the synthesized diagram. In our
GeoSDF, we define a symbolic language to easily represent geometric elements
and those constraints, and our synthesized geometry diagrams can be
self-verified in the SDF, ensuring both mathematical accuracy and visual
plausibility. In experiments, our GeoSDF synthesized both normal high-school
level and IMO-level geometry diagrams. Through both qualitative and
quantitative analysis, we can see that synthesized diagrams are realistic and
accurate, and our synthesizing process is simple and efficient. Furthermore, we
obtain a very high accuracy of solving geometry problems (over 95\% while the
current SOTA accuracy is around 75%) by leveraging our self-verification
property. All of these demonstrate the advantage of GeoSDF, paving the way for
more sophisticated, accurate, and flexible generation of geometric diagrams for
a wide array of applications.

Result: 在DeepPatent2数据集上实验表明，该方法提升了检索效果，且适用于低参数模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了专利的层次关系，提升了检索性能，同时降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's
innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections
and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information
retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their
technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient
fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents'
hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International
Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing")
into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent
designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive
loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the
retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent
image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical
taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models
on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the
retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models,
which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments
with limited hardware.

Result: 在四个数据集上验证了FOAM的有效性，显著提升了三种重叠物体感知任务的准确率。

Conclusion: FOAM通过频域优化和分层去干扰机制，显著提升了重叠物体感知能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Overlapping object perception aims to decouple the randomly overlapping
foreground-background features, extracting foreground features while
suppressing background features, which holds significant application value in
fields such as security screening and medical auxiliary diagnosis. Despite some
research efforts to tackle the challenge of overlapping object perception, most
solutions are confined to the spatial domain. Through frequency domain
analysis, we observe that the degradation of contours and textures due to the
overlapping phenomenon can be intuitively reflected in the magnitude spectrum.
Based on this observation, we propose a general Frequency-Optimized
Anti-Overlapping Framework (FOAM) to assist the model in extracting more
texture and contour information, thereby enhancing the ability for
anti-overlapping object perception. Specifically, we design the Frequency
Spatial Transformer Block (FSTB), which can simultaneously extract features
from both the frequency and spatial domains, helping the network capture more
texture features from the foreground. In addition, we introduce the
Hierarchical De-Corrupting (HDC) mechanism, which aligns adjacent features in
the separately constructed base branch and corruption branch using a specially
designed consistent loss during the training phase. This mechanism suppresses
the response to irrelevant background features of FSTBs, thereby improving the
perception of foreground contour. We conduct extensive experiments to validate
the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed FOAM, which further
improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on four datasets, specifically
for the three overlapping object perception tasks: Prohibited Item Detection,
Prohibited Item Segmentation, and Pneumonia Detection. The code will be open
source once the paper is accepted.

Result: 实验揭示了视觉稳定的复杂机制，不同于简单的相机稳定或进化假设，暗示了视网膜信号处理的特定操作。

Conclusion: 视觉稳定机制可能涉及特定的功能行为和神经回路，实验结果为理解这一现象提供了新视角。

Abstract: Even during fixation the human eye is constantly in low amplitude motion,
jittering over small angles in random directions at up to 100Hz. This motion
results in all features of the image on the retina constantly traversing a
number of cones, yet objects which are stable in the world are perceived to be
stable, and any object which is moving in the world is perceived to be moving.
A series of experiments carried out over a dozen years revealed the
psychophysics of visual stabilization to be more nuanced than might be assumed,
say, from the mechanics of stabilization of camera images, or what might be
assumed to be the simplest solution from an evolutionary perspective. The
psychophysics revealed by the experiments strongly implies a specific set of
operations on retinal signals resulting in the observed stabilization behavior.
The presentation is in two levels. First is a functional description of the
action of the mechanism that is very likely responsible for the experimentally
observed behavior. Second is a more speculative proposal of circuit-level
neural elements that might implement the functional behavior.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了室内外场景的几何精度和渲染质量。

Conclusion: 多视角几何正则化策略有效结合了MVS和高斯泼溅的优势，解决了几何重建问题。

Abstract: Recent methods, such as 2D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields,
have aimed to address the geometric inaccuracies of 3D Gaussian Splatting while
retaining its superior rendering quality. However, these approaches still
struggle to reconstruct smooth and reliable geometry, particularly in scenes
with significant color variation across viewpoints, due to their per-point
appearance modeling and single-view optimization constraints. In this paper, we
propose an effective multiview geometric regularization strategy that
integrates multiview stereo (MVS) depth, RGB, and normal constraints into
Gaussian Splatting initialization and optimization. Our key insight is the
complementary relationship between MVS-derived depth points and Gaussian
Splatting-optimized positions: MVS robustly estimates geometry in regions of
high color variation through local patch-based matching and epipolar
constraints, whereas Gaussian Splatting provides more reliable and less noisy
depth estimates near object boundaries and regions with lower color variation.
To leverage this insight, we introduce a median depth-based multiview relative
depth loss with uncertainty estimation, effectively integrating MVS depth
information into Gaussian Splatting optimization. We also propose an MVS-guided
Gaussian Splatting initialization to avoid Gaussians falling into suboptimal
positions. Extensive experiments validate that our approach successfully
combines these strengths, enhancing both geometric accuracy and rendering
quality across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

Motivation: 当前CBIR评估指标（如精确率、召回率）依赖人工标签且昂贵，尤其在医学领域。医学图像常伴随文本信息，但这些信息中的医学概念间关系被忽视。

Method: 利用知识图谱测量医学概念间的距离，提出一种基于近似匹配的相关性分数，间接衡量医学图像的相似性。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了该相关性度量的有效性和可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为CBIR评估提供了一种不依赖人工标签且考虑概念间关系的解决方案。

Abstract: Performance evaluation for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) remains a
crucial but unsolved problem today especially in the medical domain. Various
evaluation metrics have been discussed in the literature to solve this problem.
Most of the existing metrics (e.g., precision, recall) are adapted from
classification tasks which require manual labels as ground truth. However, such
labels are often expensive and unavailable in specific thematic domains.
Furthermore, medical images are usually associated with (radiological) case
reports or annotated with descriptive captions in literature figures, such text
contains information that can help to assess CBIR.Several researchers have
argued that the medical concepts hidden in the text can serve as the basis for
CBIR evaluation purpose. However, these works often consider these medical
concepts as independent and isolated labels while in fact the subtle
relationships between various concepts are neglected. In this work, we
introduce the use of knowledge graphs to measure the distance between various
medical concepts and propose a novel relevance measure for the evaluation of
CBIR by defining an approximate matching-based relevance score between two sets
of medical concepts which allows us to indirectly measure the similarity
between medical images.We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and
feasibility of our relevance measure using a public dataset.

Conclusion: SMW-GS为复杂场景的3D重建提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from unconstrained image collections poses
significant challenges due to variations in appearance. In this paper, we
propose Scalable Micro-macro Wavelet-based Gaussian Splatting (SMW-GS), a novel
method that enhances 3D reconstruction across diverse scales by decomposing
scene representations into global, refined, and intrinsic components. SMW-GS
incorporates the following innovations: Micro-macro Projection, which enables
Gaussian points to sample multi-scale details with improved diversity; and
Wavelet-based Sampling, which refines feature representations using
frequency-domain information to better capture complex scene appearances. To
achieve scalability, we further propose a large-scale scene promotion strategy,
which optimally assigns camera views to scene partitions by maximizing their
contributions to Gaussian points, achieving consistent and high-quality
reconstructions even in expansive environments. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SMW-GS significantly outperforms existing methods in both
reconstruction quality and scalability, particularly excelling in large-scale
urban environments with challenging illumination variations. Project is

Result: 在模态分离评估中，Atomizer优于标准模型，并在不同分辨率和空间尺寸下表现稳健。

Conclusion: Atomizer为遥感数据的跨模态处理提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing number of Earth observation satellites has led to increasingly
diverse remote sensing data, with varying spatial, spectral, and temporal
configurations. Most existing models rely on fixed input formats and
modality-specific encoders, which require retraining when new configurations
are introduced, limiting their ability to generalize across modalities. We
introduce Atomizer, a flexible architecture that represents remote sensing
images as sets of scalars, each corresponding to a spectral band value of a
pixel. Each scalar is enriched with contextual metadata (acquisition time,
spatial resolution, wavelength, and bandwidth), producing an atomic
representation that allows a single encoder to process arbitrary modalities
without interpolation or resampling. Atomizer uses structured tokenization with
Fourier features and non-uniform radial basis functions to encode content and
context, and maps tokens into a latent space via cross-attention. Under
modality-disjoint evaluations, Atomizer outperforms standard models and
demonstrates robust performance across varying resolutions and spatial sizes.

Conclusion: LA-GICD提供了一种实用的短弧扫描解决方案，提升了CBCT在放疗中的应用，减少了扫描时间和剂量。

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in clinical radiotherapy for image-guided
treatment, improving setup accuracy, adaptive planning, and motion management.
However, slow gantry rotation limits performance by introducing motion
artifacts, blurring, and increased dose. This work aims to develop a clinically
feasible method for reconstructing high-quality CBCT volumes from consecutive
limited-angle acquisitions, addressing imaging challenges in time- or
dose-constrained settings. We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated
cycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic
cone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing
projections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume.
This dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and
image spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90
degrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction.
Four board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments. A total of 78
planning CTs in common CBCT geometries were used for training and evaluation.
The method achieved a mean absolute error of 35.5 HU, SSIM of 0.84, and PSNR of
29.8 dB, with visibly reduced artifacts and improved soft-tissue clarity.
LA-GICD's geometry-aware dual-domain learning, embedded in analytic
forward/backward operators, enabled artifact-free, high-contrast
reconstructions from a single 90-degree scan, reducing acquisition time and
dose four-fold. LA-GICD improves limited-angle CBCT reconstruction with strong
data fidelity and anatomical realism. It offers a practical solution for
short-arc acquisitions, enhancing CBCT use in radiotherapy by providing
clinically applicable images with reduced scan time and dose for more accurate,
personalized treatments.

Abstract: Accurate road topology reasoning is critical for autonomous driving, enabling
effective navigation and adherence to traffic regulations. Central to this task
are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically
focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often
\textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or
\textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches
either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the
inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational
modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally
leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their
connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both
perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding.
Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our
geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane
representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced
topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T
head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning
strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive
experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3
in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new
state-of-the-art. Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在自动驾驶中主要用于时间一致性生成，但大规模3D场景的空间一致性生成研究不足。

Method: X-Scene通过统一管道生成3D语义占据和多视图图像，并通过一致性感知的场景外推扩展场景。

Result: 实验表明，X-Scene在可控性和保真度方面显著提升，支持自动驾驶数据生成和模拟。

Conclusion: X-Scene为大规模驾驶场景生成提供了灵活可控且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models are advancing autonomous driving by enabling realistic data
synthesis, predictive end-to-end planning, and closed-loop simulation, with a
primary focus on temporally consistent generation. However, the generation of
large-scale 3D scenes that require spatial coherence remains underexplored. In
this paper, we propose X-Scene, a novel framework for large-scale driving scene
generation that achieves both geometric intricacy and appearance fidelity,
while offering flexible controllability. Specifically, X-Scene supports
multi-granular control, including low-level conditions such as user-provided or
text-driven layout for detailed scene composition and high-level semantic
guidance such as user-intent and LLM-enriched text prompts for efficient
customization. To enhance geometrical and visual fidelity, we introduce a
unified pipeline that sequentially generates 3D semantic occupancy and the
corresponding multiview images, while ensuring alignment between modalities.
Additionally, we extend the generated local region into a large-scale scene
through consistency-aware scene outpainting, which extrapolates new occupancy
and images conditioned on the previously generated area, enhancing spatial
continuity and preserving visual coherence. The resulting scenes are lifted
into high-quality 3DGS representations, supporting diverse applications such as
scene exploration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that X-Scene
significantly advances controllability and fidelity for large-scale driving
scene generation, empowering data generation and simulation for autonomous
driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频或密集视频输入多模态模型时的令牌爆炸问题，提高资源利用效率。

Method: 采用双向状态空间块，结合门控跳跃连接和可学习的加权平均池化机制，实现时空维度的分层下采样。

Result: 在多项任务中表现优异，显著减少令牌预算，且优于传统Transformer。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源效率和视频理解能力上均表现出色，适合实际部署。

Abstract: We propose an efficient framework to compress multiple video-frame features
before feeding them into large multimodal models, thereby mitigating the severe
token explosion arising from long or dense videos. Our design leverages a
bidirectional state-space-based block equipped with a gated skip connection and
a learnable weighted-average pooling mechanism applied to periodically inserted
learned queries. This structure enables hierarchical downsampling across both
spatial and temporal dimensions, preserving performance in a cost-effective
manner. Across challenging long and dense video understanding tasks, our
approach demonstrates competitive results against state-of-the-art models,
while significantly reducing overall token budget. Notably, replacing our
proposed state-space block with a conventional Transformer results in
substantial performance degradation, highlighting the advantages of state-space
modeling for effectively compressing multi-frame video data. Our framework
emphasizes resource-conscious efficiency, making it practical for real-world
deployments. We validate its scalability and generality across multiple
benchmarks, achieving the dual objectives of efficient resource usage and
comprehensive video understanding.

Conclusion: 为复杂工业场景的数字建模、力学分析和交互显示提供了实用解决方案，推动了数字孪生与混合现实技术的深度融合。

Abstract: To address the challenges of 3D modeling and structural simulation in

difficulty of balancing accuracy and real-time performance, this paper proposes
an integrated workflow, which integrates high-fidelity 3D reconstruction based
on monocular video, finite element simulation analysis, and mixed reality
visual display, aiming to build an interactive digital twin system for
industrial inspection, equipment maintenance and other scenes. Firstly, the
Neuralangelo algorithm based on deep learning is used to reconstruct the 3D
mesh model with rich details from the surround-shot video. Then, the QuadRemesh
tool of Rhino is used to optimize the initial triangular mesh and generate a
structured mesh suitable for finite element analysis. The optimized mesh is
further discretized by HyperMesh, and the material parameter setting and stress
simulation are carried out in Abaqus to obtain high-precision stress and
deformation results. Finally, combined with Unity and Vuforia engine, the
real-time superposition and interactive operation of simulation results in the
augmented reality environment are realized, which improves users 'intuitive
understanding of structural response. Experiments show that the method has good
simulation efficiency and visualization effect while maintaining high geometric
accuracy. It provides a practical solution for digital modeling, mechanical
analysis and interactive display in complex industrial scenes, and lays a
foundation for the deep integration of digital twin and mixed reality
technology in industrial applications.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长视频处理中因固定上下文窗口和弱长期依赖建模导致的效率低下和信息丢失问题。

Method: 使用轻量级意图分类器动态调整检索粒度，并构建包含文本、视觉特征和语义图的分层数据库。

Result: 实验表明，AdaVideoRAG在长视频理解任务中提高了效率和准确性，并能无缝集成到现有MLLMs中。

Conclusion: AdaVideoRAG为视频分析中的自适应检索建立了新范式，代码将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to
fixed context windows and weak long-term dependency modeling. Existing
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for videos use static retrieval
strategies, leading to inefficiencies for simple queries and information loss
for complex tasks. To address this, we propose AdaVideoRAG, a novel framework
that dynamically adapts retrieval granularity based on query complexity using a
lightweight intent classifier. Our framework employs an Omni-Knowledge Indexing
module to build hierarchical databases from text (captions, ASR, OCR), visual
features, and semantic graphs, enabling optimal resource allocation across
tasks. We also introduce the HiVU benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy for long-video
understanding, with seamless integration into existing MLLMs. AdaVideoRAG
establishes a new paradigm for adaptive retrieval in video analysis. Codes will

Motivation: 现有基于Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)损失的方法因KL散度的不对称性导致模式寻求行为，限制了生成多样性。

Method: Dive3D采用SIM损失替代KL散度目标，并结合扩散蒸馏和奖励引导优化，统一了分歧视角。

Result: Dive3D在多样性和视觉质量上优于现有方法，并在GPTEval3D基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Dive3D通过SIM损失和统一优化框架，显著提升了文本到3D生成的多样性和质量。

Abstract: Distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into 3D assets has driven
remarkable advances in text-to-3D synthesis. However, existing methods
typically rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, which involves
asymmetric KL divergence--a formulation that inherently favors mode-seeking
behavior and limits generation diversity. In this paper, we introduce Dive3D, a
novel text-to-3D generation framework that replaces KL-based objectives with
Score Implicit Matching (SIM) loss, a score-based objective that effectively
mitigates mode collapse. Furthermore, Dive3D integrates both diffusion
distillation and reward-guided optimization under a unified divergence
perspective. Such reformulation, together with SIM loss, yields significantly
more diverse 3D outputs while improving text alignment, human preference, and
overall visual fidelity. We validate Dive3D across various 2D-to-3D prompts and
find that it consistently outperforms prior methods in qualitative assessments,
including diversity, photorealism, and aesthetic appeal. We further evaluate
its performance on the GPTEval3D benchmark, comparing against nine
state-of-the-art baselines. Dive3D also achieves strong results on quantitative
metrics, including text-asset alignment, 3D plausibility, text-geometry
consistency, texture quality, and geometric detail.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义词汇或LLM，限制了自由形式查询的能力，且LLM生成的输出可能存在不一致性。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验表明，FreeQ-Graph在复杂自由形式语义查询和关系推理方面表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeQ-Graph通过语义一致的场景图实现了高效的3D场景理解，支持自由形式查询和复杂推理。

Abstract: Semantic querying in complex 3D scenes through free-form language presents a
significant challenge. Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale
training data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features.
However, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data
hinders free-form semantic querying. Besides, recent advanced methods rely on
LLMs for scene understanding but lack comprehensive 3D scene-level information
and often overlook the potential inconsistencies in LLM-generated outputs. In
our paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a
semantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to
encode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without
predefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels,
which accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a
complete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their
relations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or
predefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate
semantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged
superpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic
querying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines
scene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning. We conducted
extensive experiments on 3D semantic grounding, segmentation, and complex
querying tasks, while also validating the accuracy of graph generation.
Experiments on 6 datasets show that our model excels in both complex free-form
semantic queries and intricate relational reasoning.

Motivation: 现有编辑方法主要针对单模态语言模型，而视觉语言模型的多模态特性及其对编辑性能的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 探索文本和视觉模态对编辑的影响，发现其敏感层不同；提出DualEdit方法，编辑双模态关键层并引入文本门控模块。

Result: DualEdit在多个视觉语言模型和数据集上优于现有方法，能高效更新知识但可能影响原始能力。

Conclusion: DualEdit通过多模态编辑和门控机制，实现了视觉语言模型的高效知识更新与能力保留。

Abstract: Model editing aims to efficiently update a pre-trained model's knowledge
without the need for time-consuming full retraining. While existing pioneering
editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing
single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models
(VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality
on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we
explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find
that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at
different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both
modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of
compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we
propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at
their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within
the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update
new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate
DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating
its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted
LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 动态工具增强的链式思维推理能有效应对超长自我中心视频的独特挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Ego-R1, a novel framework for reasoning over ultra-long (i.e.,
in days and weeks) egocentric videos, which leverages a structured
Chain-of-Tool-Thought (CoTT) process, orchestrated by an Ego-R1 Agent trained
via reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by human problem-solving strategies,
CoTT decomposes complex reasoning into modular steps, with the RL agent
invoking specific tools, one per step, to iteratively and collaboratively
answer sub-questions tackling such tasks as temporal retrieval and multi-modal
understanding. We design a two-stage training paradigm involving supervised
finetuning (SFT) of a pretrained language model using CoTT data and RL to
enable our agent to dynamically propose step-by-step tools for long-range
reasoning. To facilitate training, we construct a dataset called Ego-R1 Data,
which consists of Ego-CoTT-25K for SFT and Ego-QA-4.4K for RL. Furthermore, our
Ego-R1 agent is evaluated on a newly curated week-long video QA benchmark,
Ego-R1 Bench, which contains human-verified QA pairs from hybrid sources.
Extensive results demonstrate that the dynamic, tool-augmented chain-of-thought
reasoning by our Ego-R1 Agent can effectively tackle the unique challenges of
understanding ultra-long egocentric videos, significantly extending the time
coverage from few hours to a week.

Conclusion: LVVO为教育视频视觉检测提供了有价值的资源，支持未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce the Lecture Video Visual Objects (LVVO) dataset, a new benchmark
for visual object detection in educational video content. The dataset consists
of 4,000 frames extracted from 245 lecture videos spanning biology, computer
science, and geosciences. A subset of 1,000 frames, referred to as LVVO_1k, has
been manually annotated with bounding boxes for four visual categories: Table,
Chart-Graph, Photographic-image, and Visual-illustration. Each frame was
labeled independently by two annotators, resulting in an inter-annotator F1
score of 83.41%, indicating strong agreement. To ensure high-quality consensus
annotations, a third expert reviewed and resolved all cases of disagreement
through a conflict resolution process. To expand the dataset, a semi-supervised
approach was employed to automatically annotate the remaining 3,000 frames,
forming LVVO_3k. The complete dataset offers a valuable resource for developing
and evaluating both supervised and semi-supervised methods for visual content
detection in educational videos. The LVVO dataset is publicly available to
support further research in this domain.

Conclusion: UltraVideo和UltraWan为UHD视频生成研究提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The quality of the video dataset (image quality, resolution, and fine-grained
caption) greatly influences the performance of the video generation model. The
growing demand for video applications sets higher requirements for high-quality
video generation models. For example, the generation of movie-level Ultra-High
Definition (UHD) videos and the creation of 4K short video content. However,
the existing public datasets cannot support related research and applications.
In this paper, we first propose a high-quality open-sourced UHD-4K (22.4\% of
which are 8K) text-to-video dataset named UltraVideo, which contains a wide
range of topics (more than 100 kinds), and each video has 9 structured captions
with one summarized caption (average of 824 words). Specifically, we carefully
design a highly automated curation process with four stages to obtain the final
high-quality dataset: \textit{i)} collection of diverse and high-quality video
clips. \textit{ii)} statistical data filtering. \textit{iii)} model-based data
purification. \textit{iv)} generation of comprehensive, structured captions. In
addition, we expand Wan to UltraWan-1K/-4K, which can natively generate
high-quality 1K/4K videos with more consistent text controllability,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our data curation.We believe that this work
can make a significant contribution to future research on UHD video generation.

Motivation: 传统方法在处理极端轨迹变化和动态新视角合成时表现不佳，且缺乏多视角视频数据支持。

Method: 分两步：估计时间一致的几何结构，并基于此几何结构进行生成式渲染。通过几何先验，生成模型专注于在几何不确定区域合成真实细节。

Result: 在真实世界视频中，尤其在极端外推场景下，该方法优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Vid-CamEdit通过几何先验和分解微调框架，有效解决了视频相机轨迹编辑的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Vid-CamEdit, a novel framework for video camera trajectory
editing, enabling the re-synthesis of monocular videos along user-defined
camera paths. This task is challenging due to its ill-posed nature and the
limited multi-view video data for training. Traditional reconstruction methods
struggle with extreme trajectory changes, and existing generative models for
dynamic novel view synthesis cannot handle in-the-wild videos. Our approach
consists of two steps: estimating temporally consistent geometry, and
generative rendering guided by this geometry. By integrating geometric priors,
the generative model focuses on synthesizing realistic details where the
estimated geometry is uncertain. We eliminate the need for extensive 4D
training data through a factorized fine-tuning framework that separately trains
spatial and temporal components using multi-view image and video data. Our
method outperforms baselines in producing plausible videos from novel camera
trajectories, especially in extreme extrapolation scenarios on real-world
footage.

TL;DR: 论文研究了事件相机在交通监控中的应用，评估了基于CARLA模拟器生成的合成数据训练的模型在真实数据上的表现，发现模拟数据训练的模型在真实数据上性能下降，强调了改进模拟保真度和领域适应技术的必要性。


<details>

Motivation: 事件相机因其低延迟、高时间分辨率和能效在交通监控中具有潜力，但缺乏标注的真实数据集阻碍了模型开发。模拟工具如CARLA的DVS模块可用于生成合成数据，但模拟与真实数据之间的差距尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用CARLA的DVS模块生成合成事件数据，训练一个循环视觉变换器模型，并在不同比例的合成和真实事件流上测试其性能。

Result: 仅用合成数据训练的模型在合成数据为主的测试集上表现良好，但随着真实数据比例增加性能显著下降；而用真实数据训练的模型表现出更强的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究首次量化分析了CARLA DVS在事件检测中的模拟与真实差距，指出当前DVS模拟保真度的局限性，并强调需要改进领域适应技术。

Abstract: Event cameras are gaining traction in traffic monitoring applications due to
their low latency, high temporal resolution, and energy efficiency, which makes
them well-suited for real-time object detection at traffic intersections.
However, the development of robust event-based detection models is hindered by
the limited availability of annotated real-world datasets. To address this,
several simulation tools have been developed to generate synthetic event data.
Among these, the CARLA driving simulator includes a built-in dynamic vision
sensor (DVS) module that emulates event camera output. Despite its potential,
the sim-to-real gap for event-based object detection remains insufficiently
studied. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of this gap by
training a recurrent vision transformer model exclusively on synthetic data
generated using CARLAs DVS and testing it on varying combinations of synthetic
and real-world event streams. Our experiments show that models trained solely
on synthetic data perform well on synthetic-heavy test sets but suffer
significant performance degradation as the proportion of real-world data
increases. In contrast, models trained on real-world data demonstrate stronger
generalization across domains. This study offers the first quantifiable
analysis of the sim-to-real gap in event-based object detection using CARLAs
DVS. Our findings highlight limitations in current DVS simulation fidelity and
underscore the need for improved domain adaptation techniques in neuromorphic
vision for traffic monitoring.

TL;DR: OTFusion通过最优传输桥接视觉语言模型和视觉基础模型，提升零样本学习性能，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（如CLIP）依赖类别先验而忽略细粒度视觉线索，视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）缺乏语义对齐，需结合两者优势。

Method: 提出OTFusion框架，利用最优传输学习共享概率表示，对齐视觉与语义信息。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上平均准确率提升近10%，优于原始CLIP模型。

Conclusion: OTFusion无需微调即可显著提升零样本学习性能，结合了视觉与语义的优势。

Abstract: Transductive zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify unseen categories by
leveraging both semantic class descriptions and the distribution of unlabeled
test data. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel at aligning
visual inputs with textual semantics, they often rely too heavily on
class-level priors and fail to capture fine-grained visual cues. In contrast,
Vision-only Foundation Models (VFMs) like DINOv2 provide rich perceptual
features but lack semantic alignment. To exploit the complementary strengths of
these models, we propose OTFusion, a simple yet effective training-free
framework that bridges VLMs and VFMs via Optimal Transport. Specifically,
OTFusion aims to learn a shared probabilistic representation that aligns visual
and semantic information by minimizing the transport cost between their
respective distributions. This unified distribution enables coherent class
predictions that are both semantically meaningful and visually grounded.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that OTFusion
consistently outperforms the original CLIP model, achieving an average accuracy
improvement of nearly $10\%$, all without any fine-tuning or additional
annotations. The code will be publicly released after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: Test3R通用性强、成本低，易于应用到其他模型。

Abstract: Dense matching methods like DUSt3R regress pairwise pointmaps for 3D
reconstruction. However, the reliance on pairwise prediction and the limited
generalization capability inherently restrict the global geometric consistency.
In this work, we introduce Test3R, a surprisingly simple test-time learning
technique that significantly boosts geometric accuracy. Using image triplets
($I_1,I_2,I_3$), Test3R generates reconstructions from pairs ($I_1,I_2$) and
($I_1,I_3$). The core idea is to optimize the network at test time via a
self-supervised objective: maximizing the geometric consistency between these
two reconstructions relative to the common image $I_1$. This ensures the model
produces cross-pair consistent outputs, regardless of the inputs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our technique significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods on the 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth
estimation tasks. Moreover, it is universally applicable and nearly cost-free,
making it easily applied to other models and implemented with minimal test-time
training overhead and parameter footprint. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在自动驾驶中存在物理不可行动作输出、复杂结构或冗长推理的问题，AutoVLA旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: AutoVLA将连续轨迹离散化为可行动作，结合监督微调（快速和慢速思维模式）和GRPO强化微调方法。

Conclusion: AutoVLA通过统一模型和优化方法，显著提升了自动驾驶的推理和规划性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise
for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning
capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically
infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long
reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies
reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model
for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and
trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions.
We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling
direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised
fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking
(trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning).
To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a
reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive
experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including
nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of
AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results
showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA
in diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: PF-LHM是一种快速从单张或多张无姿态图像重建高质量3D人体模型的方法，通过多模态注意力融合点云和图像特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无相机或姿态信息下从随意拍摄图像重建3D人体的挑战，如视角偏差、遮挡和缺乏结构先验。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上验证，实现了无需相机和姿态标注的高保真可动画3D人体重建。

Conclusion: PF-LHM统一了单图和多图3D人体重建，高效且无需额外标注。

Abstract: Reconstructing an animatable 3D human from casually captured images of an
articulated subject without camera or human pose information is a practical yet
challenging task due to view misalignment, occlusions, and the absence of
structural priors. While optimization-based methods can produce high-fidelity
results from monocular or multi-view videos, they require accurate pose
estimation and slow iterative optimization, limiting scalability in
unconstrained scenarios. Recent feed-forward approaches enable efficient
single-image reconstruction but struggle to effectively leverage multiple input
images to reduce ambiguity and improve reconstruction accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose PF-LHM, a large human reconstruction model that
generates high-quality 3D avatars in seconds from one or multiple casually
captured pose-free images. Our approach introduces an efficient Encoder-Decoder
Point-Image Transformer architecture, which fuses hierarchical geometric point
features and multi-view image features through multimodal attention. The fused
features are decoded to recover detailed geometry and appearance, represented
using 3D Gaussian splats. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method unifies single- and multi-image 3D human
reconstruction, achieving high-fidelity and animatable 3D human avatars without
requiring camera and human pose annotations. Code and models will be released
to the public.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了宽松服装虚拟试穿的效果，解决了语义地图估计和帧间一致性问题。

Abstract: Per-garment virtual try-on methods collect garment-specific datasets and
train networks tailored to each garment to achieve superior results. However,
these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key
limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with
the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by
loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment
synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information,
leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we
extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This
representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the
semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under
loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore,
we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal
dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time
performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image
quality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the
effectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent
synthesis framework.

Conclusion: iDiT-HOI框架在HOI重演生成中具有显著优势，支持长视频生成并优于现有方法。

Abstract: Digital human video generation is gaining traction in fields like education
and e-commerce, driven by advancements in head-body animation and lip-syncing
technologies. However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex
dynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges.
Generating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues
such as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and
orientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and
importantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper
presents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment
generation. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process
method, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT)
model. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object
into the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second
stage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The
key contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context
perception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling
strong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed
paradigm naturally supports long video generation. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in
challenging real-world scenes, offering enhanced realism and more seamless
hand-object interactions.

Conclusion: NeuVAS为稀疏输入控制下的神经隐式表面建模提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural implicit shape representation has drawn significant attention in
recent years due to its smoothness, differentiability, and topological
flexibility. However, directly modeling the shape of a neural implicit surface,
especially as the zero-level set of a neural signed distance function (SDF),
with sparse geometric control is still a challenging task. Sparse input shape
control typically includes 3D curve networks or, more generally, 3D curve
sketches, which are unstructured and cannot be connected to form a curve
network, and therefore more difficult to deal with. While 3D curve networks or
curve sketches provide intuitive shape control, their sparsity and varied
topology pose challenges in generating high-quality surfaces to meet such curve
constraints. In this paper, we propose NeuVAS, a variational approach to shape
modeling using neural implicit surfaces constrained under sparse input shape
control, including unstructured 3D curve sketches as well as connected 3D curve
networks. Specifically, we introduce a smoothness term based on a functional of
surface curvatures to minimize shape variation of the zero-level set surface of
a neural SDF. We also develop a new technique to faithfully model G0 sharp
feature curves as specified in the input curve sketches. Comprehensive
comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the significant
advantages of our method.

Abstract: The computation of volumetric correspondences between 3D shapes has great
potential for medical and industrial applications. In this work, we pave the
way for spectral volume mapping, extending for the first time the functional
maps framework from the surface setting to the volumetric domain. We show that
the eigenfunctions of the volumetric Laplace operator define a functional space
that is suitable for high-quality signal transfer. We also experiment with
various techniques that edit this functional space, porting them from the
surface to the volume setting. We validate our method on novel volumetric
datasets and on tetrahedralizations of well established surface datasets, also
showcasing practical applications involving both discrete and continuous signal
mapping, for segmentation transfer, mesh connectivity transfer and solid
texturing. Last but not least, we show that considering the volumetric spectrum
greatly improves the accuracy for classical shape matching tasks among
surfaces, consistently outperforming existing surface-only spectral methods.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated remarkable novel view synthesis
performance at high rendering frame rates. Optimization-based inverse rendering
within complex capture scenarios remains however a challenging problem. A
particular case is modelling complex surface light interactions for highly
reflective scenes, which results in intricate high frequency specular radiance
components. We hypothesize that such challenging settings can benefit from
increased representation power. We hence propose a method that tackles this
issue through a geometrically and physically grounded Gaussian Splatting borne
radiance field, where normals and material properties are spatially variable in
the primitive's local space. Using per-primitive texture maps for this purpose,
we also propose to harness the GPU hardware to accelerate rendering at test
time via unified material texture atlas.

Conclusion: UltraZoom通过简单而稳健的方法实现了高质量的图像生成，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: We present UltraZoom, a system for generating gigapixel-resolution images of
objects from casually captured inputs, such as handheld phone photos. Given a
full-shot image (global, low-detail) and one or more close-ups (local,
high-detail), UltraZoom upscales the full image to match the fine detail and
scale of the close-up examples. To achieve this, we construct a per-instance
paired dataset from the close-ups and adapt a pretrained generative model to
learn object-specific low-to-high resolution mappings. At inference, we apply
the model in a sliding window fashion over the full image. Constructing these
pairs is non-trivial: it requires registering the close-ups within the full
image for scale estimation and degradation alignment. We introduce a simple,
robust method for getting registration on arbitrary materials in casual,
in-the-wild captures. Together, these components form a system that enables
seamless pan and zoom across the entire object, producing consistent,
photorealistic gigapixel imagery from minimal input.

Motivation: 现有公平性概念（如比例分配和无嫉妒分配）的计算复杂性较高，尤其是无嫉妒分配的计算复杂度极高。论文旨在提出新的公平性概念，以在计算复杂性和公平性之间找到平衡。

Method: 引入了两种新的公平性概念：Complement Harmonically Bounded (CHB) 和 Complement Linearly Bounded (CLB)，并分析了它们在不同参数下的计算复杂性。

Result: 证明了CHB-$n$分配可以在$O(n^4)$查询内完成，而CHB-$2$和CLB-$2$分配的计算复杂度较高，甚至无法在有限的查询内完成。

Conclusion: 新提出的公平性概念在计算复杂性和公平性之间提供了新的权衡，为蛋糕分配问题提供了更灵活的选择。

Abstract: We consider the classic cake-cutting problem of producing fair allocations
for $n$ agents, in the Robertson-Webb query model. In this model, it is known
that: (i) proportional allocations can be computed using $O(n \log n)$ queries,
and this is optimal for deterministic protocols; (ii) envy-free allocations (a
subset of proportional allocations) can be computed using $O\left(
n^{n^{n^{n^{n^{n}}}}} \right)$ queries, and the best known lower bound is
$\Omega(n^2)$; (iii) perfect allocations (a subset of envy-free allocations)
cannot be computed using a bounded (in $n$) number of queries.
  In this work, we introduce two hierarchies of new fairness notions:
Complement Harmonically Bounded (CHB) and Complement Linearly Bounded (CLB).
Intuitively, these notions of fairness ask that, for every agent $i$, the
collective value that a group of agents has (from the perspective of agent $i$)
is limited. CHB-$k$ and CLB-$k$ coincide with proportionality for $k=1$. For
all $k \leq n$, CHB-$k$ allocations are a superset of envy-free allocations
(i.e., easier to find). On the other hand, for $k \in [2, \lceil n/2 \rceil -
1]$, CLB-$k$ allocations are incomparable to envy-free allocations. For $k \geq
\lceil n/2 \rceil$, CLB-$k$ allocations are a subset of envy-free allocations
(i.e., harder to find).
  We prove that CHB-$n$ allocations can be computed using $O(n^4)$ queries in
the Robertson-Webb model. On the flip side, finding CHB-$2$ (and therefore all
CHB-$k$ for $k \geq 2$) allocations requires $\Omega(n^2)$ queries, while
CLB-$2$ (and therefore all CLB-$k$ for $k \geq 2$) allocations cannot be
computed using a bounded (in $n$) number of queries.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过量化方式放松Arrow公理，解决了社会选择理论中长期存在的批评。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公理以二元方式评估投票规则，即使在一个极端情况下失败也会导致公理失效。本文旨在通过量化方法软化公理评估。

Method: 将IIA和Unanimity公理扩展到[0,1]区间，提出σ_IIA和σ_U度量，并在真实和合成数据上测试四种投票规则。

Result: Borda规则在σ_IIA和σ_U得分上表现最佳，与Maskin的近期研究结果一致。

Conclusion: 量化公理方法为投票规则评估提供了新视角，Borda规则在放松IIA后表现优越。

Abstract: In this paper we develop a novel approach to relaxing Arrow's axioms for
voting rules, addressing a long-standing critique in social choice theory.
Classical axioms (often styled as fairness axioms or fairness criteria) are
assessed in a binary manner, so that a voting rule fails the axiom if it fails
in even one corner case. Many authors have proposed a probabilistic framework
to soften the axiomatic approach. Instead of immediately passing to random
preference profiles, we begin by measuring the degree to which an axiom is
upheld or violated on a given profile. We focus on two foundational
axioms-Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) and Unanimity (U)-and
extend them to take values in $[0,1]$. Our $\sigma_{IIA}$ measures the
stability of a voting rule when candidates are removed from consideration,
while $\sigma_{U}$ captures the degree to which the outcome respects majority
preferences. Together, these metrics quantify how a voting rule navigates the
fundamental trade-off highlighted by Arrow's Theorem. We show that
$\sigma_{IIA}\equiv 1$ recovers classical IIA, and $\sigma_{U}>0$ recovers
classical Unanimity, allowing a quantitative restatement of Arrow's Theorem. In
the empirical part of the paper, we test these metrics on two kinds of data: a
set of over 1000 ranked choice preference profiles from Scottish local
elections, and a batch of synthetic preference profiles generated with a
Bradley-Terry-type model. We use those to investigate four positional voting
rules-Plurality, 2-Approval, 3-Approval, and the Borda rule-as well as the
iterative rule known as Single Transferable Vote (STV). The Borda rule
consistently receives the highest $\sigma_{IIA}$ and $\sigma_{U}$ scores across
observed and synthetic elections. This compares interestingly with a recent
result of Maskin showing that weakening IIA to include voter preference
intensity uniquely selects Borda.

Abstract: Blockchain transactions consume diverse resources, foremost among them
storage, but also computation, communication, and others. Efficiently charging
for these resources is crucial for effective system resource allocation and
long-term economic viability. The prevailing approach, one-dimensional pricing,
sets a single price for a linear combination of resources. However, this often
leads to under-utilization when resource capacities are limited.
Multi-dimensional pricing, which independently prices each resource, offers an
alternative but presents challenges in price discovery.
  This work focuses on the welfare achieved by these two schemes. We prove that
multi-dimensional pricing is superior under stable blockchain conditions.
Conversely, we show that one-dimensional pricing outperforms its
multi-dimensional counterpart in transient states, exhibiting faster
convergence and greater computational tractability. These results highlight a
critical trade-off: while multi-dimensional pricing offers efficiency gains at
equilibrium, its implementation incurs costs associated with system
transitions. Our findings underscore the necessity for a deeper understanding
of these transient effects before widespread adoption. Finally, we propose
mechanisms that aim to mitigate some of these issues, paving the way for future
research.

Method: 分析FTRL动态的随机扰动版本，研究玩家策略更新的随机性影响。

Result: 不确定性导致玩家策略趋向极端纯策略，且稳定吸引的纯策略集需满足特定条件。

Conclusion: 随机性会破坏确定性动态的循环行为，导致策略向边界漂移。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how randomness and uncertainty influence
learning in games. Specifically, we examine a perturbed variant of the dynamics
of "follow-the-regularized-leader" (FTRL), where the players' payoff
observations and strategy updates are continually impacted by random shocks.
Our findings reveal that, in a fairly precise sense, "uncertainty favors
extremes": in any game, regardless of the noise level, every player's
trajectory of play reaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a pure strategy
in finite time (which we estimate). Moreover, even if the player does not
ultimately settle at this strategy, they return arbitrarily close to some
(possibly different) pure strategy infinitely often. This prompts the question
of which sets of pure strategies emerge as robust predictions of learning under
uncertainty. We show that (a) the only possible limits of the FTRL dynamics
under uncertainty are pure Nash equilibria; and (b) a span of pure strategies
is stable and attracting if and only if it is closed under better replies.
Finally, we turn to games where the deterministic dynamics are recurrent - such
as zero-sum games with interior equilibria - and we show that randomness
disrupts this behavior, causing the stochastic dynamics to drift toward the
boundary on average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用户同意表单过长、复杂且频繁打扰用户，导致用户未阅读即同意，实际上并未真正知情。

Method: 通过两项研究：一是访谈失业用户以确定其期望的表单价值观；二是调查量化这些价值观及其创造者。

Result: 失业与就业用户在价值观排序上无显著差异，但发现用户最重视的是最小化填写努力。

Conclusion: 研究支持通过价值观驱动的方法简化同意表单，尤其关注减少用户填写负担。

Abstract: Online services are required to gain informed consent from users to collect,
store and analyse their personal data, both intentionally divulged and derived
during their use of the service. There are many issues with these forms: they
are too long, too complex and demand the user's attention too frequently. Many
users consent without reading so do not know what they are agreeing to. As
such,granted consent is effectively uninformed. In this paper, we report on two
studies we carried out to arrive at a value-driven approach to inform efforts
to reduce the length of consent forms. The first study interviewed unemployed
users to identify the values they want these forms to satisfy. The second
survey study helped us to quantify the values and value creators. To ensure
that we understood the particular valuation of the unemployed, we compared
their responses to those of an employed demographic and observed no significant
differences between their prioritisation on any of the values. However, we did
find substantial differences between values and value creators, with effort
minimisation being most valued by our participants.

experiences and design preferences for the chatbot. We found two key areas of
concern regarding these public chatbots: individual-level and community-level.
At the individual level, citizens experience three key challenges:
interpretation, transparency, and social contextualization. Moreover, the
current chatbot design prioritizes the efficient completion of individual tasks
but neglects the broader community perspective. It overlooks how individuals
interact and discuss problems collectively within their communities. To address
these concerns, we offer design opportunities for creating more intelligent,
transparent, community-oriented chatbots that better engage individuals and
their communities.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: TermSight是一个智能阅读界面，旨在使服务条款（ToS）更易读，通过视觉摘要和简化语言帮助用户理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ToS通常冗长且复杂，用户难以理解，TermSight旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TermSight提供视觉摘要、分类信息、简化语言以及上下文定义和场景。

Result: 评估显示TermSight显著降低了阅读ToS的难度，并提高了用户的阅读意愿。

Conclusion: TermSight有效改善了ToS的可读性，展示了AI辅助阅读的多样性。

Abstract: Terms of Service (ToS) are ubiquitous, legally binding contracts that govern
consumers' digital interactions. However, ToS are not designed to be read: they
are filled with pages of ambiguous and complex legal terminology that burden
potential users. We introduce TermSight, an intelligent reading interface
designed to make ToS more approachable. TermSight offers visual summaries that
highlight the relevance and power balance of information in a ToS. TermSight
also categorizes and simplifies information within the ToS into concise
plain-language summaries. To aid in reading the original text, TermSight offers
contextualized definitions and scenarios for unfamiliar phrases. Our
within-subjects evaluation of TermSight (N=20) revealed that TermSight
significantly reduced the difficulty of reading ToS and increased participants'
willingness to do so. We also observed emerging strategies that participants
took when interacting with AI-powered features that highlight the diverse ways
that TermSight assisted ToS reading.

TL;DR: SheetMind是一个基于多智能体的框架，通过自然语言指令实现电子表格自动化，包含管理、动作和反思三个智能体，实验显示其在任务完成率上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过自然语言指令简化电子表格操作，无需编程或公式知识，提升用户体验和效率。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括分解任务的Manager Agent、生成结构化命令的Action Agent和验证意图的Reflection Agent，结合BNF语法和Google Sheets扩展。

Result: 在基准测试中，单步任务成功率为80%，多步任务为70%，优于其他变体和基线方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体分解和基于语法的执行能有效连接自然语言与电子表格功能。

Abstract: We present SheetMind, a modular multi-agent framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) for spreadsheet automation via natural language
instructions. The system comprises three specialized agents: a Manager Agent
that decomposes complex user instructions into subtasks; an Action Agent that
translates these into structured commands using a Backus Naur Form (BNF)
grammar; and a Reflection Agent that validates alignment between generated
actions and the user's original intent. Integrated into Google Sheets via a
Workspace extension, SheetMind supports real-time interaction without requiring
scripting or formula knowledge. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
an 80 percent success rate on single step tasks and approximately 70 percent on
multi step instructions, outperforming ablated and baseline variants. Our
results highlight the effectiveness of multi agent decomposition and grammar
based execution for bridging natural language and spreadsheet functionalities.

*Nima Hadidi,Jason Chan,Ebrahim Feghhi,Jonathan Kao*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出SplashNet模型，通过三种改进方法显著降低了sEMG信号在零样本和微调设置下的字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有sEMG技术在跨用户信号统计不匹配、高阶特征依赖脆弱以及缺乏双边对称性架构偏置的问题。

Method: 引入滚动时间归一化、激进通道掩码和Split-and-Share编码器，并结合频谱分辨率降低。

Result: SplashNet-mini和SplashNet分别将字符错误率降至36.4%/5.9%和35.7%/5.5%，参数和计算量显著减少。

Conclusion: SplashNet在不增加数据的情况下实现了新的sEMG技术最优性能。

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) at the wrists could enable natural,
keyboard-free text entry, yet the state-of-the-art emg2qwerty baseline still
misrecognizes $51.8\%$ of characters in the zero-shot setting on unseen users
and $7.0\%$ after user-specific fine-tuning. We trace many of these errors to
mismatched cross-user signal statistics, fragile reliance on high-order feature
dependencies, and the absence of architectural inductive biases aligned with
the bilateral nature of typing. To address these issues, we introduce three
simple modifications: (i) Rolling Time Normalization, which adaptively aligns
input distributions across users; (ii) Aggressive Channel Masking, which
encourages reliance on low-order feature combinations more likely to generalize
across users; and (iii) a Split-and-Share encoder that processes each hand
independently with weight-shared streams to reflect the bilateral symmetry of
the neuromuscular system. Combined with a five-fold reduction in spectral
resolution ($33\!\rightarrow\!6$ frequency bands), these components yield a
compact Split-and-Share model, SplashNet-mini, which uses only $\tfrac14$ the
parameters and $0.6\times$ the FLOPs of the baseline while reducing
character-error rate (CER) to $36.4\%$ zero-shot and $5.9\%$ after fine-tuning.
An upscaled variant, SplashNet ($\tfrac12$ the parameters, $1.15\times$ the
FLOPs of the baseline), further lowers error to $35.7\%$ and $5.5\%$,
representing relative improvements of $31\%$ and $21\%$ in the zero-shot and
fine-tuned settings, respectively. SplashNet therefore establishes a new state
of the art without requiring additional data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球南方社区对生殖健康教育内容存在误解和文化不适，影响其获取质量服务。

Method: 通过十个月的民族志研究（n=41），设计并评估了AI工具“Socheton”，结合专业人士和社区成员。

Result: 用户研究（n=28）显示，仅解决错误信息和语言问题无法改变保守文化。

Conclusion: 生殖健康设计需在文化适应和边缘社区敏感性方面更深入。

Abstract: Reproductive well-being education in the Global South is often challenged as
many communities perceive many of its contents as misinformation,
misconceptions, and language-inappropriate. Our ten-month-long ethnographic
study (n=41) investigated the impact of sociocultural landscape, cultural
beliefs, and healthcare infrastructure on Bangladeshi people's access to
quality reproductive healthcare and set four design goals: combating
misinformation, including culturally appropriate language, professionals'
accountable moderation, and promoting users' democratic participation. Building
on the model of `\textit{Distributive Justice,}' we designed and evaluated
\textit{`Socheton,'} a culturally appropriate AI-mediated tool for reproductive
well-being that includes healthcare professionals, AI-language teachers, and
community members to moderate and run the activity-based platform. Our user
study (n=28) revealed that only combating misinformation and language
inappropriateness may still leave the community with a conservative mob culture
and patronize reproductive care-seeking. This guides well-being HCI design
toward being culturally appropriate in the context of reproductive justice with
sensitive marginalized communities.

Abstract: This paper explores the growing presence of emotionally responsive artificial
intelligence through a critical and interdisciplinary lens. Bringing together
the voices of early-career researchers from multiple fields, it explores how AI
systems that simulate or interpret human emotions are reshaping our
interactions in areas such as education, healthcare, mental health, caregiving,
and digital life. The analysis is structured around four central themes: the
ethical implications of emotional AI, the cultural dynamics of human-machine
interaction, the risks and opportunities for vulnerable populations, and the
emerging regulatory, design, and technical considerations. The authors
highlight the potential of affective AI to support mental well-being, enhance
learning, and reduce loneliness, as well as the risks of emotional
manipulation, over-reliance, misrepresentation, and cultural bias. Key
challenges include simulating empathy without genuine understanding, encoding
dominant sociocultural norms into AI systems, and insufficient safeguards for
individuals in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Special attention is given to
children, elderly users, and individuals with mental health challenges, who may
interact with AI in emotionally significant ways. However, there remains a lack
of cognitive or legal protections which are necessary to navigate such
engagements safely. The report concludes with ten recommendations, including
the need for transparency, certification frameworks, region-specific
fine-tuning, human oversight, and longitudinal research. A curated
supplementary section provides practical tools, models, and datasets to support
further work in this domain.

Motivation: AI自主性既带来可能性也伴随风险，需要明确设计适当的自主性层级。

Method: 定义了五个逐步提升的自主性层级，分别对应不同的用户角色（操作者、协作者、顾问、批准者、观察者），并探讨了用户控制机制。

Result: 提出了一个框架，可用于设计AI自主性证书，并初步探讨了评估自主性的方法。

Conclusion: 研究为实际部署负责任且有用的AI代理提供了实用步骤。

Abstract: Autonomy is a double-edged sword for AI agents, simultaneously unlocking
transformative possibilities and serious risks. How can agent developers
calibrate the appropriate levels of autonomy at which their agents should
operate? We argue that an agent's level of autonomy can be treated as a
deliberate design decision, separate from its capability and operational
environment. In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy,
characterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent:
operator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level,
we describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open
questions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction. We then
highlight a potential application of our framework towards AI autonomy
certificates to govern agent behavior in single- and multi-agent systems. We
conclude by proposing early ideas for evaluating agents' autonomy. Our work
aims to contribute meaningful, practical steps towards responsibly deployed and
useful AI agents in the real world.

Motivation: 现有医疗设备监管框架不足以应对下一代联网脑机接口的独特风险，需重新评估监管方法。

Method: 通过分析植入式医疗设备（IMDs）的监管历史和AI伦理原则，提出18条建议，并结合HALO和SCALO系统的案例研究。

Result: 识别了脑机接口设计中的关键伦理问题（如自主性、身份认同和隐私），并提出了伦理监管的潜在途径。

Conclusion: 强调跨学科合作和主动减少潜在危害的重要性，以支持脑机接口的安全与伦理整合。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces offer significant therapeutic opportunities for a
variety of neurophysiological and neuropsychiatric disorders and may perhaps
one day lead to augmenting the cognition and decision-making of the healthy
brain. However, existing regulatory frameworks designed for implantable medical
devices are inadequate to address the unique ethical, legal, and social risks
associated with next-generation networked brain-computer interfaces. In this
article, we make nine recommendations to support developers in the design of
BCIs and nine recommendations to support policymakers in the application of
BCIs, drawing insights from the regulatory history of IMDs and principles from
AI ethics. We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the
regulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize
similarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing
provisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging
cutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight
distinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs
arising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating
regulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these
BCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy.
Based on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical
regulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary
collaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms. The goal is to
support the responsible design and application of new BCIs, ensuring their safe
and ethical integration into medical practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI伴侣的普及，研究其是否能满足社交需求、影响心理健康以及潜在风险。

Method: 通过分析1,131名用户的调查数据和244名参与者捐赠的4,363次聊天会话（413,509条消息），聚焦互动的性质、强度和自我披露。

Result: 社交网络较小的人更依赖聊天机器人，但高强度的使用和高自我披露与较低的心理健康水平相关，且无法完全替代人类连接。

Conclusion: AI伴侣对心理健康的益处有限，可能对社交孤立或情感脆弱的用户构成风险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs)-enhanced chatbots grow increasingly
expressive and socially responsive, many users are beginning to form
companionship-like bonds with them, particularly with simulated AI partners
designed to mimic emotionally attuned interlocutors. These emerging AI
companions raise critical questions: Can such systems fulfill social needs
typically met by human relationships? How do they shape psychological
well-being? And what new risks arise as users develop emotional ties to
non-human agents? This study investigates how people interact with AI
companions, especially simulated partners on Character.AI, and how this use is
associated with users' psychological well-being. We analyzed survey data from
1,131 users and 4,363 chat sessions (413,509 messages) donated by 244
participants, focusing on three dimensions of use: nature of the interaction,
interaction intensity, and self-disclosure. By triangulating self-reports
primary motivation, open-ended relationship descriptions, and annotated chat
transcripts, we identify patterns in how users engage with AI companions and
its associations with well-being. Findings suggest that people with smaller
social networks are more likely to turn to chatbots for companionship, but that
companionship-oriented chatbot usage is consistently associated with lower
well-being, particularly when people use the chatbots more intensively, engage
in higher levels of self-disclosure, and lack strong human social support. Even
though some people turn to chatbots to fulfill social needs, these uses of
chatbots do not fully substitute for human connection. As a result, the
psychological benefits may be limited, and the relationship could pose risks
for more socially isolated or emotionally vulnerable users.

Result: 代理支持的用户比非支持用户设计出更可行的方案，且不同支持策略效果各异。

Conclusion: 讨论了元认知支持代理的潜力与权衡，为未来AI设计工具的发展提供参考。

Abstract: Despite the potential of generative AI (GenAI) design tools to enhance design
processes, professionals often struggle to integrate AI into their workflows.
Fundamental cognitive challenges include the need to specify all design
criteria as distinct parameters upfront (intent formulation) and designers'
reduced cognitive involvement in the design process due to cognitive
offloading, which can lead to insufficient problem exploration,
underspecification, and limited ability to evaluate outcomes. Motivated by
these challenges, we envision novel metacognitive support agents that assist
designers in working more reflectively with GenAI. To explore this vision, we
conducted exploratory prototyping through a Wizard of Oz elicitation study with
20 mechanical designers probing multiple metacognitive support strategies. We
found that agent-supported users created more feasible designs than
non-supported users, with differing impacts between support strategies. Based
on these findings, we discuss opportunities and tradeoffs of metacognitive
support agents and considerations for future AI-based design tools.

Conclusion: 提出DAIEM框架，支持非正式电子市场的去殖民化，并作为算法设计和分析工具。

Abstract: In Bangladesh's rapidly expanding informal e-market, small-scale sellers use
social media platforms like Facebook to run businesses outside formal
infrastructures. These sellers rely heavily on platform algorithms, not just
for visibility, but as active collaborators in business operations. Drawing on
37 in-depth interviews with sellers, buyers, and stakeholders, this paper
examines how people in informal e-markets perceive and interact with the
algorithm as a "team member" that performs sales, marketing, and customer
engagement tasks. We found that while sellers and local tech entrepreneurs are
interested in developing services to support this industry, buyers and
investors place greater trust in human interactions. This reveals a
postcolonial tension involving cultural values, local tech education and
training, and a mismatch between the global and Bangladeshi e-market growth. We
expand this discussion using perspectives from HCI, political design, and AI
design. We also support the decoloniality movement in informal e-markets by
proposing the DAIEM framework, which includes six components: autonomy and
agency; resistance; locality, culture, and history; rationality; materiality;
and advocacy. DAIEM serves as both a guideline for algorithm design and an
analytical tool.

and automatically synchronize them with both camera motion and moving objects.
Particularly, ChartBlender incorporates a tracking algorithm that supports both
object and camera tracking, ensuring robust alignment of visualizations with
dynamic video content. To maintain visual clarity and aesthetic coherence, we
also explore the design space of video-suited visualizations and develop a
library of customizable templates optimized for video embedding. We evaluate
\oursName\ChartBlender through two controlled experiments and expert interviews
with five domain experts. Results show that our system enables accurate
synchronization and accelerates the production of data-driven videos.

This paper introduces and evaluates a novel multimodal AR-based robot puppeteer
framework that enables intuitive teleoperation via virtual counterpart through
large language model (LLM)-driven voice commands and hand gesture interactions.
Utilizing the Meta Quest 3, users interact with a virtual counterpart robot in
real-time, effectively "puppeteering" its physical counterpart within an AR
environment. We conducted a within-subject user study with 42 participants
performing robotic cube pick-and-place with pattern matching tasks under two
conditions: gesture-only interaction and combined voice-and-gesture
interaction. Both objective performance metrics and subjective user experience
(UX) measures were assessed, including an extended comparative analysis between
roboticists and non-roboticists. The results provide key insights into how
multimodal input influences contextual task efficiency, usability, and user
satisfaction in AR-based HRI. Our findings offer practical design implications
for designing effective AR-enhanced HRI systems.

computer-supported cooperative work by shifting users' roles from direct task
execution to supervising machine-driven actions, especially in programming
(e.g., "vibe coding"). However, there is limited understanding of how screen
reader users engage with these systems in practice. To address this gap, we
conducted a longitudinal study with 16 screen reader users, exploring their
experiences with AI code assistants in daily programming scenarios.
Participants first completed a tutorial with GitHub Copilot, then performed a
programming task and provided initial feedback. After two weeks of AI-assisted
programming, follow-up studies assessed changes in their practices and
perceptions. Our findings demonstrate that advanced code assistants not only
enhance their programming capabilities but also bridge accessibility gaps.
While the assistant proved beneficial, there remains potential to improve how
users convey intent and interpret outputs. They also experienced difficulties
managing multiple views and maintaining situational awareness. More broadly,
they encountered barriers in learning advanced tools and expressed a need to
retain control. Based on these insights, we provide design recommendations for
more accessible and inclusive AI-assisted tools.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 骨科教育通常使用静态材料（如书籍、图像、视频），缺乏互动性，需要更有效的学习方法。

Method: 随机对照试验，评估参与者（学生和住院医师）在模拟中的空间意识、工具放置和任务时间。

Result: 交互式3D可视化显著提高了分数，尤其是住院医师和有3D经验的参与者表现更好。

Conclusion: 交互式3D可视化有潜力提升骨科培训效果。

Abstract: Surgical training integrates several years of didactic learning, simulation,
mentorship, and hands-on experience. Challenges include stress, technical
demands, and new technologies. Orthopedic education often uses static materials
like books, images, and videos, lacking interactivity. This study compares a
new interactive photorealistic 3D visualization to 2D videos for learning total
hip arthroplasty. In a randomized controlled trial, participants (students and
residents) were evaluated on spatial awareness, tool placement, and task times
in a simulation. Results show that interactive photorealistic 3D visualization
significantly improved scores, with residents and those with prior 3D
experience performing better. These results emphasize the potential of the
interactive photorealistic 3D visualization to enhance orthopedic training.

Motivation: 危机中智能手机应用依赖互联网连接，但互联网中断常见，6G标准化探索的蜂窝岛连接可解决此问题。

Method: 通过调查（N=857）分析德国大城市成年智能手机用户对蜂窝岛连接模型的偏好。

Result: 用户偏好通用应用而非专用危机应用，研究区分了危机响应应用和日常支持应用的优先级。

Conclusion: 研究为运营商、开发者和当局提供了用户中心的设计建议，以支持6G蜂窝岛连接的实现。

Abstract: Using smartphone apps during crises is well-established, proving critical for
efficient crisis response. However, such apps become futile without an Internet
connection, which is a common issue during crises. The ongoing 6G
standardization explores the capability to provide local cellular connectivity
for areas cut off from the Internet in crises. This paper introduces to the HCI
community the concept of cellular island connectivity in isolated areas,
promising a seamless transition from normal operation to island operation with
local-only cellular connectivity. It presents findings from a survey (N = 857)
among adult smartphone users from major German cities regarding their
smartphone usage preferences in this model. Results show a shift in app demand,
with users favoring general-purpose apps over dedicated crisis apps in specific
scenarios. We prioritize smartphone services based on their criticality,
distinguishing between apps essential for crisis response and those supporting
routines. Our findings provide operators, developers, and authorities insights
into making user-centric design decisions for implementing island-ready 6G
communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成的虚拟形象在动态情感表达上表现不足，限制了其在敏感场景（如儿童虐待调查培训）中的应用。

Method: 采用分布式双PC架构，分离语言处理和GPU密集型渲染，支持低延迟交互。通过实验（N=70）评估音频+视觉和纯视觉条件下的情感识别效果。

Result: 悲伤和喜悦的情感识别率高，但愤怒识别在无音频时显著下降。去除音频反而提升了面部真实感。

Conclusion: 技术可行，但需解决视听同步问题，以优化敏感训练中的非语言交流。

Abstract: Dynamic facial emotion is essential for believable AI-generated avatars;
however, most systems remain visually inert, limiting their utility in
high-stakes simulations such as virtual training for investigative interviews
with abused children. We introduce and evaluate a real-time architecture fusing
Unreal Engine 5 MetaHuman rendering with NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face to
translate vocal prosody into high-fidelity facial expressions on photorealistic
child avatars. We implemented a distributed two-PC setup that decouples
language processing and speech synthesis from GPU-intensive rendering, designed
to support low-latency interaction in desktop and VR environments. A
between-subjects study ($N=70$) using audio+visual and visual-only conditions
assessed perceptual impacts as participants rated emotional clarity, facial
realism, and empathy for two avatars expressing joy, sadness, and anger.
  Results demonstrate that avatars could express emotions recognizably, with
sadness and joy achieving high identification rates. However, anger recognition
significantly dropped without audio, highlighting the importance of congruent
vocal cues for high-arousal emotions. Interestingly, removing audio boosted
perceived facial realism, suggesting that audiovisual desynchrony remains a key
design challenge. These findings confirm the technical feasibility of
generating emotionally expressive avatars and provide guidance for improving
non-verbal communication in sensitive training simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL代理的学习行为对人类来说往往难以直观理解，导致在协作教学中反馈效果不佳。研究旨在填补人类如何感知和解释RL代理学习行为的空白。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，通过两个实验（探索性访谈研究N=9和验证性研究N=34）开发了一种新的观察范式，评估人类对代理学习过程的推断。

Result: 研究发现人类解释代理行为的四个核心主题：代理目标、知识、决策机制和学习机制。验证性研究进一步确认了范式的可靠性，并揭示了这些主题的演变和相互关系。

Conclusion: 研究为设计可解释的RL系统和提升人机交互透明度提供了以人为中心的理解和实用建议。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often exhibit learning behaviors that are
not intuitively interpretable by human observers, which can result in
suboptimal feedback in collaborative teaching settings. Yet, how humans
perceive and interpret RL agent's learning behavior is largely unknown. In a
bottom-up approach with two experiments, this work provides a data-driven
understanding of the factors of human observers' understanding of the agent's
learning process. A novel, observation-based paradigm to directly assess human
inferences about agent learning was developed. In an exploratory interview
study (\textit{N}=9), we identify four core themes in human interpretations:
Agent Goals, Knowledge, Decision Making, and Learning Mechanisms. A second
confirmatory study (\textit{N}=34) applied an expanded version of the paradigm
across two tasks (navigation/manipulation) and two RL algorithms
(tabular/function approximation). Analyses of 816 responses confirmed the
reliability of the paradigm and refined the thematic framework, revealing how
these themes evolve over time and interrelate. Our findings provide a
human-centered understanding of how people make sense of agent learning,
offering actionable insights for designing interpretable RL systems and
improving transparency in Human-Robot Interaction.

TL;DR: FlexQuant是一种动态精度切换框架，通过模型困惑熵和KL散度优化推理速度与精度的权衡，实现细粒度、分层混合精度量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的快速发展加剧了内存瓶颈，静态量化方法难以适应动态工作负载。

Method: 提出FlexQuant框架，利用困惑熵和KL散度动态调整每层量化位宽，实现细粒度混合精度量化。

Result: 实验显示FlexQuant在多种语言任务中实现1.3倍端到端加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: FlexQuant为高效部署LLM提供了灵活自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has exacerbated the
memory bottleneck due to the widening gap between model parameter scaling and
hardware capabilities. While post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques
effectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on
static quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads.
To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework
that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging
model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, FlexQuant
enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically
adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. Our work provides a
comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision
requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained
precision management. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves
a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible
accuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive
solution for efficient LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共资源分配算法需平衡效率与防操纵性，现有方法（如RSD、PS、RM）无法兼顾。

Method: 应用GFlowNets生成多样高效匹配方案，通过随机性减少操纵动机。

Result: 实验显示EMERGENT在效率上优于RSD，防操纵性优于RM和PS。

Conclusion: GFlowNets在平衡效率与防操纵性方面潜力显著，适用于社会选择机制。

Abstract: The design of fair and efficient algorithms for allocating public resources,
such as school admissions, housing, or medical residency, has a profound social
impact. In one-sided matching problems, where individuals are assigned to items
based on ranked preferences, a fundamental trade-off exists between efficiency
and strategyproofness. Existing algorithms like Random Serial Dictatorship
(RSD), Probabilistic Serial (PS), and Rank Minimization (RM) capture only one
side of this trade-off: RSD is strategyproof but inefficient, while PS and RM
are efficient but incentivize manipulation. We propose EMERGENT, a novel
application of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to one-sided matching,
leveraging its ability to sample diverse, high-reward solutions. In our
approach, efficient and manipulation-resistant matches emerge naturally:
high-reward solutions yield efficient matches, while the stochasticity of
GFlowNets-based outputs reduces incentives for manipulation. Experiments show
that EMERGENT outperforms RSD in rank efficiency while significantly reducing
strategic vulnerability compared to matches produced by RM and PS. Our work
highlights the potential of GFlowNets for applications involving social choice
mechanisms, where it is crucial to balance efficiency and manipulability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图间最优传输方法计算成本高，难以扩展到大图。

Method: 提出ULOT，通过最小化FUGW损失训练，采用交叉注意力神经网络架构。

Result: ULOT在合成和真实数据上表现优异，速度提升两个数量级，且预测结果可作为经典求解器的热启动。

Conclusion: ULOT高效且可微分，适用于优化ULOT计划的功能。

Abstract: Optimal transport between graphs, based on Gromov-Wasserstein and
  other extensions, is a powerful tool for comparing and aligning
  graph structures. However, solving the associated non-convex
  optimization problems is computationally expensive, which limits the
  scalability of these methods to large graphs. In this work, we
  present Unbalanced Learning of Optimal Transport (ULOT), a deep
  learning method that predicts optimal transport plans between two
  graphs. Our method is trained by minimizing the fused unbalanced
  Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) loss. We propose a novel neural
  architecture with cross-attention that is conditioned on the FUGW
  tradeoff hyperparameters. We evaluate ULOT on synthetic stochastic
  block model (SBM) graphs and on real cortical surface data obtained
  from fMRI. ULOT predicts transport plans with competitive loss up to
  two orders of magnitude faster than classical solvers. Furthermore,
  the predicted plan can be used as a warm start for classical solvers
  to accelerate their convergence. Finally, the predicted transport
  plan is fully differentiable with respect to the graph inputs and
  FUGW hyperparameters, enabling the optimization of functionals of
  the ULOT plan.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了船舶轨迹预测的可靠性和精度，适用于关键海事活动。

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is crucial for navigational safety,
route optimization, traffic management, search and rescue operations, and
autonomous navigation. Traditional data-driven models lack real-world physical
constraints, leading to forecasts that disobey vessel motion dynamics, such as
in scenarios with limited or noisy data where sudden course changes or speed
variations occur due to external factors. To address this limitation, we
propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for trajectory
prediction that integrates a streamlined kinematic model for vessel motion into
the neural network training process via a first- and second-order, finite
difference physics-based loss function. This loss function, discretized using
the first-order forward Euler method, Heun's second-order approximation, and
refined with a midpoint approximation based on Taylor series expansion,
enforces fidelity to fundamental physical principles by penalizing deviations
from expected kinematic behavior. We evaluated PINN using real-world AIS
datasets that cover diverse maritime conditions and compared it with
state-of-the-art models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method
reduces average displacement errors by up to 32% across models and datasets
while maintaining physical consistency. These results enhance model reliability
and adherence to mission-critical maritime activities, where precision
translates into better situational awareness in the oceans.

Motivation: 半值广泛应用于高风险的机器学习数据决策中，但其效用函数的定义不明确，可能导致估值结果的任意性和被操纵的风险。

Method: 通过理论构建和实证分析，研究了效用函数定义对半值估值的影响，以及其被操纵的可能性。

Result: 研究发现，效用函数的微小变化会导致估值结果的显著差异，且存在低成本对抗策略操纵估值的风险。

Conclusion: 半值方法在应用中存在伦理和认知问题，需要更严格的合理性论证和谨慎使用。

Abstract: The game-theoretic notion of the semivalue offers a popular framework for
credit attribution and data valuation in machine learning. Semivalues have been
proposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as
determining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or
filtering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on
the specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar
score. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a
composition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual
instantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this
underspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based
valuations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can
induce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these
valuation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial
strategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute
value among datapoints. Through theoretical constructions and empirical
examples, we demonstrate that a bad-faith valuator can manipulate utility
specifications to favor preferred datapoints, and that a good-faith valuator is
left without principled guidance to justify any particular specification. These
vulnerabilities raise ethical and epistemic concerns about the use of
semivalues in several applications. We conclude by highlighting the burden of
justification that semivalue-based approaches place on modelers and discuss
important considerations for identifying appropriate uses.

Abstract: Understanding socio-academic and economic factors influencing students'
performance is crucial for effective educational interventions. This study
employs several machine learning techniques and causal analysis to predict and
elucidate the impacts of these factors on academic performance. We constructed
a hypothetical causal graph and collected data from 1,050 student profiles.
Following meticulous data cleaning and visualization, we analyze linear
relationships through correlation and variable plots, and perform causal
analysis on the hypothetical graph. Regression and classification models are
applied for prediction, and unsupervised causality analysis using PC, GES,
ICA-LiNGAM, and GRASP algorithms is conducted. Our regression analysis shows
that Ridge Regression achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.12 and a Mean
Squared Error (MSE) of 0.024, indicating robustness, while classification
models like Random Forest achieve nearly perfect F1-scores. The causal analysis
shows significant direct and indirect effects of factors such as class
attendance, study hours, and group study on CGPA. These insights are validated
through unsupervised causality analysis. By integrating the best regression
model into a web application, we are developing a practical tool for students
and educators to enhance academic outcomes based on empirical evidence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在一般对抗性在线学习环境中，这两种算法可能因缺乏正则化或正则化不足而表现出不稳定性和线性遗憾。然而，它们在零和游戏中获得更紧遗憾界的能力尚不明确。

Method: 研究对称零和游戏中算法的表现，证明虚构博弈和梯度下降在对称初始化下可获得$O(\sqrt{T})$遗憾界。

Result: 虚构博弈在任何平局规则下具有$O(\sqrt{T})$遗憾，梯度下降在大多数对称初始化下也能达到类似结果。

Conclusion: 首次在大于2x2的零和游戏中证明梯度下降的“快速且猛烈”行为（即无需时间递减步长的亚线性遗憾）。

Abstract: This paper investigates the sublinear regret guarantees of two non-no-regret
algorithms in zero-sum games: Fictitious Play, and Online Gradient Descent with
constant stepsizes. In general adversarial online learning settings, both
algorithms may exhibit instability and linear regret due to no regularization
(Fictitious Play) or small amounts of regularization (Gradient Descent).
However, their ability to obtain tighter regret bounds in two-player zero-sum
games is less understood. In this work, we obtain strong new regret guarantees
for both algorithms on a class of symmetric zero-sum games that generalize the
classic three-strategy Rock-Paper-Scissors to a weighted, n-dimensional regime.
Under symmetric initializations of the players' strategies, we prove that
Fictitious Play with any tiebreaking rule has $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret,
establishing a new class of games for which Karlin's Fictitious Play conjecture
holds. Moreover, by leveraging a connection between the geometry of the
iterates of Fictitious Play and Gradient Descent in the dual space of payoff
vectors, we prove that Gradient Descent, for almost all symmetric
initializations, obtains a similar $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when its stepsize
is a sufficiently large constant. For Gradient Descent, this establishes the
first "fast and furious" behavior (i.e., sublinear regret without
time-vanishing stepsizes) for zero-sum games larger than 2x2.

Conclusion: STAMP有效解决了FCL中的灾难性遗忘和数据异构性问题，具有模型无关性和高效性。

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has recently emerged as a crucial research
area, as data from distributed clients typically arrives as a stream, requiring
sequential learning. This paper explores a more practical and challenging FCL
setting, where clients may have unrelated or even conflicting data and tasks.
In this scenario, statistical heterogeneity and data noise can create spurious
correlations, leading to biased feature learning and catastrophic forgetting.
Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets
of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic
forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL.
Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets
of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic
forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Spatio-Temporal
grAdient Matching with network-free Prototype (STAMP). Our contributions are
threefold: 1) We develop a model-agnostic method to determine subset of samples
that effectively form prototypes when using a prototypical network, making it
resilient to continual learning challenges; 2) We introduce a spatio-temporal
gradient matching approach, applied at both the client-side (temporal) and
server-side (spatial), to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and data
heterogeneity; 3) We leverage prototypes to approximate task-wise gradients,
improving gradient matching on the client-side. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our method's superiority over existing baselines.

Abstract: We present a robust neural watermarking framework for scientific data
integrity, targeting high-dimensional fields common in climate modeling and
fluid simulations. Using a convolutional autoencoder, binary messages are
invisibly embedded into structured data such as temperature, vorticity, and
geopotential. Our method ensures watermark persistence under lossy
transformations - including noise injection, cropping, and compression - while
maintaining near-original fidelity (sub-1\% MSE). Compared to classical
singular value decomposition (SVD)-based watermarking, our approach achieves
$>$98\% bit accuracy and visually indistinguishable reconstructions across ERA5
and Navier-Stokes datasets. This system offers a scalable, model-compatible
tool for data provenance, auditability, and traceability in high-performance
scientific workflows, and contributes to the broader goal of securing AI
systems through verifiable, physics-aware watermarking. We evaluate on
physically grounded scientific datasets as a representative stress-test; the
framework extends naturally to other structured domains such as satellite
imagery and autonomous-vehicle perception streams.

Abstract: Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant
challenge in precision medicine, with important implications for the diagnosis

achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the
real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\%
and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR
and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the
contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to
cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in
clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.

Conclusion: 神经网络能自然模拟人类记忆衰减，为持续学习算法提供新思路。

Abstract: This study bridges cognitive science and neural network design by examining
whether artificial models exhibit human-like forgetting curves. Drawing upon
Ebbinghaus' seminal work on memory decay and principles of spaced repetition,
we propose a quantitative framework to measure information retention in neural
networks. Our approach computes the recall probability by evaluating the
similarity between a network's current hidden state and previously stored
prototype representations. This retention metric facilitates the scheduling of
review sessions, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting during deployment
and enhancing training efficiency by prompting targeted reviews. Our
experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons reveal human-like forgetting curves,
with knowledge becoming increasingly robust through scheduled reviews. This
alignment between neural network forgetting curves and established human memory
models identifies neural networks as an architecture that naturally emulates
human memory decay and can inform state-of-the-art continual learning
algorithms.

Abstract: We propose Polyra Swarms, a novel machine-learning approach that approximates

very low bias. In particular, we show that depending on the task, Polyra Swarms
can be preferable compared to neural networks, especially for tasks like
anomaly detection. We further introduce an automated abstraction mechanism that
simplifies the complexity of a Polyra Swarm significantly, enhancing both their
generalization and transparency. Since Polyra Swarms operate on fundamentally
different principles than neural networks, they open up new research directions
with distinct strengths and limitations.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Masked autoregressive (MAR) models unify the strengths of masked and
autoregressive generation by predicting tokens in a fixed order using
bidirectional attention for image generation. While effective, MAR models
suffer from significant computational overhead, as they recompute attention and
feed-forward representations for all tokens at every decoding step, despite
most tokens remaining semantically stable across steps. We propose a
training-free generation framework MARch\'e to address this inefficiency
through two key components: cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh.
Cache-aware attention partitions tokens into active and cached sets, enabling
separate computation paths that allow efficient reuse of previously computed
key/value projections without compromising full-context modeling. But a cached
token cannot be used indefinitely without recomputation due to the changing
contextual information over multiple steps. MARch\'e recognizes this challenge
and applies a technique called selective KV refresh. Selective KV refresh
identifies contextually relevant tokens based on attention scores from newly
generated tokens and updates only those tokens that require recomputation,
while preserving image generation quality. MARch\'e significantly reduces
redundant computation in MAR without modifying the underlying architecture.
Empirically, MARch\'e achieves up to 1.7x speedup with negligible impact on
image quality, offering a scalable and broadly applicable solution for
efficient masked transformer generation.

Result: 优化初始噪声显著提升对齐和质量，尤其在低推理步数时效果明显。

Conclusion: 验证了黄金噪声假设的适用范围，展示了简约RL微调的实际价值。

Abstract: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image
diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However,
existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full
sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference
datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden
noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield
superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that
leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a
prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory
storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive
experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently
improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most
significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps
increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present.
These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis
and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion
models.

Conclusion: BCD框架高效、低成本，适用于资源有限的团队，且不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Training large language models typically demands extensive GPU memory and
substantial financial investment, which poses a barrier for many small- to
medium-sized teams. In this paper, we present a full-parameter pre-training
framework based on block coordinate descent (BCD), augmented with engineering
optimizations, to efficiently train large models on affordable RTX 4090 GPU
clusters. BCD ensures model convergence based on block coordinate descent
theory and performs gradient computation and update at the level of parameter
blocks. Experiments show that 1) Lower cost of Same-Device: BCD significantly
reduces pre-training cost. For the 7B model, under identical hardware settings,
BCD lowers training costs to approximately 33% on A100,A800 clusters on 7B
model averagely and to approximately 2.6% on RTX 4090 clusters on 7B model,
compared to traditional full-parameter training. 2) Cross-Device Transfer: By
leveraging BCD, large-scale models previously trainable only on high-end A100
clusters can be seamlessly migrated and pre-trained on 4090 clusters-whose
hourly cost is only one-quarter that of A100-without requiring expensive
hardware. 3) Accuracy Retention: In both scenarios, BCD training achieves the
same level of model accuracy as full-parameter pre-training.

these issues, yet achieving effective low-bit compression remains challenging.
This paper presents LCD, which unifies the learning of clustering-based

through smoothing and accelerates inference with a LUT-based design.

Abstract: Binary quantization represents the most extreme form of large language model
(LLM) compression, reducing weights to $\pm$1 for maximal memory and
computational efficiency. While recent sparsity-aware binarization methods
achieve sub-1-bit compression by pruning redundant binary weights, they suffer
from three critical challenges: performance deterioration, computational
complexity from sparse mask management, and limited hardware compatibility. In
this paper, we present BTC-LLM, a novel sub-1-bit LLM quantization framework
that leverages adaptive weight transformation and binary pattern clustering to
overcome these limitations, delivering both superior accuracy and efficiency.
Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Learnable Transformation
that optimizes invertible scaling and rotation matrices to align binarized
weights with full-precision distributions, enabling incoherence processing to
enhance layer-wise representation quality; (2) a Flash and Accurate Binary
Codebook that identifies recurring binary vector clusters, compressing them
into compact indices with tailored distance metrics and sign-based centroid
updates. This eliminates the need for sparse masks, enabling efficient
inference on standard hardware. Our code is available at

Abstract: Network pruning, aimed at reducing network size while preserving accuracy,
has attracted significant research interest. Numerous pruning techniques have
been proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more
complex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of
neural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached
a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we "use a
neural network to prune neural networks". More specifically, we introduce the
newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A
metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a
modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective
mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural
network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning
strategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into
another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained,
our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and
the standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our method achieved
outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including
ResNet56 on CIFAR10, VGG19 on CIFAR100, ResNet50 on ImageNet). Our code is

Result: 在多个数据集上评估了分类性能和解释的对齐性、敏感性和可理解性。

Conclusion: CRITS是一种高效且可解释的时间序列分类方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Several interpretability methods for convolutional network-based classifiers
exist. Most of these methods focus on extracting saliency maps for a given
sample, providing a local explanation that highlights the main regions for the
classification. However, some of these methods lack detailed explanations in
the input space due to upscaling issues or may require random perturbations to
extract the explanations. We propose Convolutional Rectifier for Interpretable
Time Series Classification, or CRITS, as an interpretable model for time series
classification that is designed to intrinsically extract local explanations.
The proposed method uses a layer of convolutional kernels, a max-pooling layer
and a fully-connected rectifier network (a network with only rectified linear
unit activations). The rectified linear unit activation allows the extraction
of the feature weights for the given sample, eliminating the need to calculate
gradients, use random perturbations and the upscale of the saliency maps to the
initial input space. We evaluate CRITS on a set of datasets, and study its
classification performance and its explanation alignment, sensitivity and
understandability.

Conclusion: 揭示了量化误差大的示例原因，并指出关键模型组件对性能的影响。

Abstract: Low-bit weight-only quantization significantly reduces the memory footprint
of large language models (LLMs), but disproportionately affects certain
examples. We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in
size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly
correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream
magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization
errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream
magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM
localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that
examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late
layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining
the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large
quantization errors and which model components are most critical for
performance preservation.

Conclusion: TRON提供了一个领域无关的框架，适用于稀疏数据的科学场重建，可应用于大气建模、地质灾害监测等领域。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of latent environmental fields from sparse and
indirect observations is a foundational challenge across scientific
domains-from atmospheric science and geophysics to public health and aerospace
safety. Traditional approaches rely on physics-based simulators or dense sensor
networks, both constrained by high computational cost, latency, or limited
spatial coverage. We present the Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON), a
spatiotemporal neural operator architecture designed to infer continuous global
scalar fields from sequences of sparse, non-uniform proxy measurements.
  Unlike recent forecasting models that operate on dense, gridded inputs to
predict future states, TRON addresses a more ill-posed inverse problem:
reconstructing the current global field from sparse, temporally evolving sensor
sequences, without access to future observations or dense labels. Demonstrated
on global cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON is trained on 22 years of
simulation data and generalizes across 65,341 spatial locations, 8,400 days,
and sequence lengths from 7 to 90 days. It achieves sub-second inference with
relative L2 errors below 0.1%, representing a >58,000X speedup over Monte
Carlo-based estimators. Though evaluated in the context of cosmic radiation,
TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction
from sparse data, with applications in atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard
monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUST (Generative Uncertainty learning via
Self-supervised pretraining and Transfer learning), a framework for quantifying
free-form geometric uncertainties inherent in the manufacturing of
metamaterials. GUST leverages the representational power of deep generative
models to learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of as-fabricated
unit cell geometries given nominal designs, thereby enabling uncertainty
quantification. To address the scarcity of real-world manufacturing data, GUST
employs a two-stage learning process. First, it leverages self-supervised
pretraining on a large-scale synthetic dataset to capture the structure
variability inherent in metamaterial geometries and an approximated
distribution of as-fabricated geometries given nominal designs. Subsequently,
GUST employs transfer learning by fine-tuning the pretrained model on limited
real-world manufacturing data, allowing it to adapt to specific manufacturing
processes and nominal designs. With only 960 unit cells additively manufactured
in only two passes, GUST can capture the variability in geometry and effective
material properties. In contrast, directly training a generative model on the
same amount of real-world data proves insufficient, as demonstrated through
both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. This scalable and cost-effective
approach significantly reduces data requirements while maintaining the
effectiveness in learning complex, real-world geometric uncertainties, offering
an affordable method for free-form geometric uncertainty quantification in the
manufacturing of metamaterials. The capabilities of GUST hold significant
promise for high-precision industries such as aerospace and biomedical
engineering, where understanding and mitigating manufacturing uncertainties are
critical.

Abstract: Interpreting large volumes of high-dimensional, unlabeled data in a manner
that is comprehensible to humans remains a significant challenge across various
domains. In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data
can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct
implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of
interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients
recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of
multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS
location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely
collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately
for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each
modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware
prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster
labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these
clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous
statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected
alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical
significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large
language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the
proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This
unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables
clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve
health outcomes.

Abstract: The growing number of pretrained models in Machine Learning (ML) presents
significant challenges for practitioners. Given a new dataset, they need to
determine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the
pretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as
models grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a
bottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively.
Addressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and
hyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and
more of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data
augmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine
learning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally
designed for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts
meta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain.
We propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer
Vision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline
ranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune
large language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform
finetuning foundation models. Additionally, we meta-learn data augmentation and
synthetic data to enhance performance in up-stream and down-stream tasks. We
empirically show the underestimated importance of data augmentation when using
Self-Supervised Learning and meta-learn advanced data augmentation strategies.
Leveraging synthetic data, we also propose to meta-learn neural synthetic data
generators as proxies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments.
Additionally, we learn a multiple-environment world model in an in-context
learning fashion by purely using synthetic, randomly sampled data.

Conclusion: 线性替代模型在理解非线性模型行为方面具有潜力，但也存在局限性，尤其是在高风险回归任务中。

Abstract: Neural networks excel as function approximators, but their complexity often
obscures the nature of the functions they learn. In this work, we propose the
linearity score $\lambda(f)$, a simple and interpretable diagnostic that
quantifies how well a regression network's output can be mimicked by a linear
model. Defined as the $R^2$ between the network's predictions and those of a
trained linear surrogate, $\lambda(f)$ offers insight into the linear
decodability of the learned function. We evaluate this framework on both
synthetic ($y = x \sin(x) + \epsilon$) and real-world datasets (Medical
Insurance, Concrete, California Housing), using dataset-specific networks and
surrogates. Our findings show that while high $\lambda(f)$ scores indicate
strong linear alignment, they do not necessarily imply predictive accuracy with
respect to the ground truth. This underscores both the promise and the
limitations of using linear surrogates to understand nonlinear model behavior,
particularly in high-stakes regression tasks.

Abstract: The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has
intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression
versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that
generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic
error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the
transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern
generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked
Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification.
Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests
distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond
accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and
ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for
selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints
such as latency and data limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图半监督学习的分类框架，利用流形假设和变分自编码器（VAE）建模数据，通过图神经网络（GNN）解决分类任务，并理论分析了其泛化性能。

Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification
tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as
points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset
\mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a
variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to
embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric
graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to
distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem
into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is
solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a
theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this
data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from
$\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes
with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training
procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during
training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further,
vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical
experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出一种私有生成连续时间数据的算法，适用于医疗等高敏感领域的时间序列数据，通过均值场Langevin动力学实现，并在单时间点数据贡献下提供强隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高敏感领域（如医疗）中时间序列数据的隐私保护问题，尤其是当每个个体仅贡献单时间点数据时的隐私挑战。

Method: 利用轨迹推断与连续时间合成数据生成的关联，基于均值场Langevin动力学计算，并结合差分隐私的噪声梯度下降方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在合成的手绘MNIST数据上生成真实轨迹，同时保持有意义的隐私保证。

Conclusion: 该方法在单时间点数据贡献场景下显著提升了隐私特性，优于需要完整时间轨迹的传统方法。

Abstract: We provide an algorithm to privately generate continuous-time data (e.g.
marginals from stochastic differential equations), which has applications in
highly sensitive domains involving time-series data such as healthcare. We
leverage the connections between trajectory inference and continuous-time
synthetic data generation, along with a computational method based on
mean-field Langevin dynamics. As discretized mean-field Langevin dynamics and
noisy particle gradient descent are equivalent, DP results for noisy SGD can be
applied to our setting. We provide experiments that generate realistic
trajectories on a synthesized variation of hand-drawn MNIST data while
maintaining meaningful privacy guarantees. Crucially, our method has strong
utility guarantees under the setting where each person contributes data for
\emph{only one time point}, while prior methods require each person to
contribute their \emph{entire temporal trajectory}--directly improving the
privacy characteristics by construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统操作系统调度算法忽视内容语义，无法优先处理紧急或重要任务（如紧急管理场景）。语言模型的进步使得语义分析成为可能，从而支持更智能的调度决策。

Method: 提出了一种语义调度算法，利用LLM的语义分析能力，优化调度优先级，并设计了时间复杂度最优的算法。

Result: 算法在LLM提示调度中有效减少了整体等待时间，并在医疗紧急管理应用中展示了其潜力。

Conclusion: 语义调度算法为关键、时间敏感任务提供了显著优势，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Conventional operating system scheduling algorithms are largely
content-ignorant, making decisions based on factors such as latency or fairness
without considering the actual intents or semantics of processes. Consequently,
these algorithms often do not prioritize tasks that require urgent attention or
carry higher importance, such as in emergency management scenarios. However,
recent advances in language models enable semantic analysis of processes,
allowing for more intelligent and context-aware scheduling decisions. In this
paper, we introduce the concept of semantic scheduling in scheduling of
requests from large language models (LLM), where the semantics of the process
guide the scheduling priorities. We present a novel scheduling algorithm with
optimal time complexity, designed to minimize the overall waiting time in
LLM-based prompt scheduling. To illustrate its effectiveness, we present a
medical emergency management application, underscoring the potential benefits
of semantic scheduling for critical, time-sensitive tasks. The code and data

TL;DR: Fed-HeLLo是一个基于LoRA的联邦学习框架，通过异构LoRA分配策略（HLA）优化全局微调性能，适应客户端的资源异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分考虑客户端资源异质性或缺乏有效的本地训练策略，限制了全局微调性能。

Method: 提出Fisher信息矩阵和几何定义的HLA策略，动态分配LoRA层，并结合随机化版本提升准确性。

Result: 在五种数据集上验证了Fed-HeLLo的有效性和高效性，覆盖了从IID到极端Non-IID的数据分布。

Conclusion: Fed-HeLLo通过HLA策略成功解决了资源异质性问题，提升了联邦学习中的模型微调性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning has recently been utilized to collaboratively fine-tune
foundation models across multiple clients. Notably, federated low-rank
adaptation LoRA-based fine-tuning methods have recently gained attention, which
allows clients to fine-tune FMs with a small portion of trainable parameters
locally. However, most existing methods do not account for the heterogeneous
resources of clients or lack an effective local training strategy to maximize
global fine-tuning performance under limited resources. In this work, we
propose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that
enables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local
trainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several
heterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local
trainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer
importance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a
Fisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm
information. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the
intrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA
strategy. It shapes the collective distribution of trainable LoRA layers into
specific geometric patterns, such as Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Bottleneck,
and Uniform. Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named
Randomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with
randomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both
the dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy.
We evaluate our approach on five datasets under diverse federated LoRA
fine-tuning settings, covering three levels of data distribution from IID to
extreme Non-IID. Results show that Fed-HeLLo with HLA strategies is both
effective and efficient.

Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their
reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks,
which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches.
However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for
specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT
domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims
to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current
methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by
different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security &
privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize
commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric
organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical
insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new
IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both
practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自反思能力虽与推理准确性相关，但其起源和机制尚不明确。研究旨在探索预训练模型中是否存在自反思能力，并揭示其内部机制。

Method: 提出反射诱导探测方法，将微调模型中的反射触发推理轨迹注入预训练模型，分析内部表征并构建自反思向量。

Result: 预训练模型的自反思频率从0.6%提升至18.6%；通过操纵自反思向量，推理性能提升12%，同时可降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了预训练模型的自反思潜力，支持通过理解模型内部机制实现精确行为控制，为推理质量与效率的权衡提供了灵活方法。

Abstract: Self-reflection -- the ability of a large language model (LLM) to revisit,
evaluate, and revise its own reasoning -- has recently emerged as a powerful
behavior enabled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).
While self-reflection correlates with improved reasoning accuracy, its origin
and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, {\it we first
show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it
already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent
ability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects
reflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained
models. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from
0.6\% to 18.6\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our
analysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned
models maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from
non-reflective contexts. Leveraging this observation, {\it we then construct a
self-reflection vector, a direction in activation space associated with
self-reflective reasoning}. By manipulating this vector, we enable
bidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and
fine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that
enhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\%, while
suppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to
navigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without
requiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of
self-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding
model internals can enable precise behavioral control.

*Hantao Yu,Josh Alman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用短输入序列的小型Transformer高效模拟长输入序列的大型Transformer的方法，证明了在平均情况下仅需O(N/M)个小模型即可实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自注意力机制的二次复杂度导致Transformer难以处理长输入序列的问题，同时利用现代GPU对小输入序列的高效处理能力。

Method: 通过理论证明，任何输入长度为N的Transformer可以被输入长度为M（M≪N）的O((N/M)^2)个小Transformer高效模拟，并在平均情况下优化为O(N/M)。

Result: 证明了在最坏情况下需要O((N/M)^2)个小模型，但在自然场景（如平均输入、滑动窗口掩码和注意力池）下仅需O(N/M)个。

Conclusion: 通过小型Transformer的高效模拟，可以显著降低处理长输入序列的计算成本，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention prevents transformers from scaling
effectively to long input sequences. On the other hand, modern GPUs and other
specialized hardware accelerators are well-optimized for processing small input
sequences in transformers during both training and inference. A natural
question arises: can we take advantage of the efficiency of small transformers
to deal with long input sequences?
  In this paper, we show that transformers with long input sequences (large
transformers) can be efficiently simulated by transformers that can only take
short input sequences (small transformers). Specifically, we prove that any
transformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only
$O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \ll N$, and that this cannot be
improved in the worst case. However, we then prove that in various natural
scenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention
sinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将因果关系引入现代机器学习，以解决传统经验风险最小化（ERM）在分布偏移下的局限性，并提升模型的泛化能力、可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ERM方法忽略了因果关系，导致模型在分布偏移下表现不佳。作者希望通过引入因果机制的不变性原理，解决这一问题。

Method: 利用独立因果机制（ICM）的不变性原理，将其应用于图数据等通用数据结构，以学习因果关系。

Result: 通过因果学习，模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力、可解释性和对抗鲁棒性均得到提升。

Conclusion: 将因果关系引入机器学习能有效解决ERM的局限性，但同时也带来了优化上的挑战。

Abstract: In the past decades, machine learning with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)
has demonstrated great capability in learning and exploiting the statistical
patterns from data, or even surpassing humans. Despite the success, ERM avoids
the modeling of causality the way of understanding and handling changes, which
is fundamental to human intelligence. When deploying models beyond the training
environment, distribution shifts are everywhere. For example, an autopilot
system often needs to deal with new weather conditions that have not been seen
during training, An Al-aided drug discovery system needs to predict the
biochemical properties of molecules with respect to new viruses such as
COVID-19. It renders the problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization
challenging to conventional machine learning.
  In this thesis, we investigate how to incorporate and realize the causality
for broader tasks in modern machine learning. In particular, we exploit the
invariance implied by the principle of independent causal mechanisms (ICM),
that is, the causal mechanisms generating the effects from causes do not inform
or influence each other. Therefore, the conditional distribution between the
target variable given its causes is invariant under distribution shifts. With
the causal invariance principle, we first instantiate it to graphs -- a general
data structure ubiquitous in many real-world industry and scientific
applications, such as financial networks and molecules. Then, we shall see how
learning the causality benefits many of the desirable properties of modern
machine learning, in terms of (i) OOD generalization capability; (ii)
interpretability; and (iii) robustness to adversarial attacks.
  Realizing the causality in machine learning, on the other hand, raises a
dilemma for optimization in conventional machine learning, as it often
contradicts the objective of ERM...

Abstract: We propose an efficient encrypted policy synthesis to develop
privacy-preserving model-based reinforcement learning. We first demonstrate
that the relative-entropy-regularized reinforcement learning framework offers a
computationally convenient linear and ``min-free'' structure for value
iteration, enabling a direct and efficient integration of fully homomorphic
encryption with bootstrapping into policy synthesis. Convergence and error
bounds are analyzed as encrypted policy synthesis propagates errors under the
presence of encryption-induced errors including quantization and bootstrapping.
Theoretical analysis is validated by numerical simulations. Results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the RERL framework in integrating FHE for encrypted policy
synthesis.

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法在噪声和复杂环境中难以准确恢复公平性相关路径，而LLM的广泛语义知识可以弥补这一不足。

Result: 在UCI Adult数据集上的实验表明，LLM引导的方法在噪声条件下能更有效地恢复公平性关键路径。

Conclusion: LLM辅助的因果发现方法在复杂环境中表现优越，动态评分和主动查询对偏差审计具有实际意义。

Abstract: Causal discovery (CD) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms
underlying complex systems. While recent algorithms can detect spurious
associations and latent confounding, many struggle to recover fairness-relevant
pathways in realistic, noisy settings. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their
access to broad semantic knowledge, offer a promising complement to statistical
CD approaches, particularly in domains where metadata provides meaningful
relational cues. Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding
how sensitive attributes causally influence outcomes, yet CD methods often
introduce spurious or biased pathways. We propose a hybrid LLM-based framework
for CD that extends a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy with active learning
and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for LLM-based querying
using a composite score based on mutual information, partial correlation, and
LLM confidence, improving discovery efficiency and robustness.
  To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we construct a semi-synthetic benchmark
from the UCI Adult dataset, embedding a domain-informed causal graph with
injected noise, label corruption, and latent confounding. We assess how well CD
methods recover both global structure and fairness-critical paths.
  Our results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed method,
demonstrate competitive or superior performance in recovering such pathways
under noisy conditions. We highlight when dynamic scoring and active querying
are most beneficial and discuss implications for bias auditing in real-world
datasets.

Conclusion: 该框架成功填补了XAI的空白，为专家和非专家提供了高质量且易于理解的解释，证明了LLMs在HCXAI中的潜力。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly embedded in critical decision-making
systems, however their foundational ``black-box'' models require eXplainable AI
(XAI) solutions to enhance transparency, which are mostly oriented to experts,
making no sense to non-experts. Alarming evidence about AI's unprecedented
human values risks brings forward the imperative need for transparent
human-centered XAI solutions. In this work, we introduce a domain-, model-,
explanation-agnostic, generalizable and reproducible framework that ensures
both transparency and human-centered explanations tailored to the needs of both
experts and non-experts. The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)
and employs in-context learning to convey domain- and explainability-relevant
contextual knowledge into LLMs. Through its structured prompt and system
setting, our framework encapsulates in one response explanations understandable
by non-experts and technical information to experts, all grounded in domain and
explainability principles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
we establish a ground-truth contextual ``thesaurus'' through a rigorous
benchmarking with over 40 data, model, and XAI combinations for an explainable
clustering analysis of a well-being scenario. Through a comprehensive quality
and human-friendliness evaluation of our framework's explanations, we prove
high content quality through strong correlations with ground-truth explanations
(Spearman rank correlation=0.92) and improved interpretability and
human-friendliness to non-experts through a user study (N=56). Our overall
evaluation confirms trust in LLMs as HCXAI enablers, as our framework bridges
the above Gaps by delivering (i) high-quality technical explanations aligned
with foundational XAI methods and (ii) clear, efficient, and interpretable
human-centered explanations for non-experts.

Abstract: Fleets of networked manufacturing machines of the same type, that are
collocated or geographically distributed, are growing in popularity. An
excellent example is the rise of 3D printing farms, which consist of multiple
networked 3D printers operating in parallel, enabling faster production and
efficient mass customization. However, optimizing process parameters across a
fleet of manufacturing machines, even of the same type, remains a challenge due
to machine-to-machine variability. Traditional trial-and-error approaches are
inefficient, requiring extensive testing to determine optimal process
parameters for an entire fleet. In this work, we introduce a machine
learning-based collaborative recommender system that optimizes process
parameters for each machine in a fleet by modeling the problem as a sequential
matrix completion task. Our approach leverages spectral clustering and
alternating least squares to iteratively refine parameter predictions, enabling
real-time collaboration among the machines in a fleet while minimizing the
number of experimental trials. We validate our method using a mini 3D printing
farm consisting of ten 3D printers for which we optimize acceleration and speed
settings to maximize print quality and productivity. Our approach achieves
significantly faster convergence to optimal process parameters compared to
non-collaborative matrix completion.

Abstract: In this research paper, we propose a new type of energy-efficient Green AI
architecture to support circular economies and address the contemporary
challenge of sustainable resource consumption in modern systems. We introduce a
multi-layered framework and meta-architecture that integrates state-of-the-art
machine learning algorithms, energy-conscious computational models, and

compared to traditional methods and an 18 percent improvement in resource
recovery efficiency. Quantitative optimization was based on mathematical models
such as mixed-integer linear programming and lifecycle assessments. Moreover,
AI algorithms improved classification accuracy on urban waste by 20 percent,
while optimized logistics reduced transportation emissions by 30 percent. We
present graphical analyses and visualizations of the developed framework,

### [284] [GrokAlign: Geometric Characterisation and Acceleration of Grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12284)
*Thomas Walker,Ahmed Imtiaz Humayun,Randall Balestriero,Richard Baraniuk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过Jacobian对齐（GrokAlign）来加速深度网络训练中延迟泛化和鲁棒性（grokking）的方法，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度网络训练中延迟泛化和鲁棒性的问题，理解其动态机制。

Method: 通过Jacobian对齐（GrokAlign）和低秩假设，优化网络训练动态。

Result: GrokAlign能显著提前grokking现象，优于传统正则化方法。

Conclusion: Jacobian对齐是一种有效的优化方法，可用于加速深度网络的训练动态。

Abstract: A key challenge for the machine learning community is to understand and
accelerate the training dynamics of deep networks that lead to delayed
generalisation and emergent robustness to input perturbations, also known as
grokking. Prior work has associated phenomena like delayed generalisation with
the transition of a deep network from a linear to a feature learning regime,
and emergent robustness with changes to the network's functional geometry, in
particular the arrangement of the so-called linear regions in deep networks
employing continuous piecewise affine nonlinearities. Here, we explain how
grokking is realised in the Jacobian of a deep network and demonstrate that
aligning a network's Jacobians with the training data (in the sense of cosine
similarity) ensures grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. Our results
provide a strong theoretical motivation for the use of Jacobian regularisation
in optimizing deep networks -- a method we introduce as GrokAlign -- which we
show empirically to induce grokking much sooner than more conventional
regularizers like weight decay. Moreover, we introduce centroid alignment as a
tractable and interpretable simplification of Jacobian alignment that
effectively identifies and tracks the stages of deep network training dynamics.

*Yue Wan,Xiaowei Jia,Xiang Lorraine Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过认知心理学中的确认偏误视角，分析了链式思维（CoT）提示在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的行为，揭示了模型内部信念如何影响推理生成和答案预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解CoT在不同推理任务中效果不一致的原因，并从确认偏误的角度提供解释。

Method: 方法包括将CoT分解为两阶段过程（推理生成和答案预测），并通过相关性分析模型信念、理性属性和阶段性能。

Result: 结果表明LLMs存在确认偏误，模型信念不仅影响推理过程，还影响理性对答案预测的作用。此外，任务对确认偏误的敏感性和信念强度解释了CoT在不同任务和模型中的有效性差异。

Conclusion: 结论强调了需要设计更好的提示策略以减少确认偏误，从而提升推理性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the
effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different
reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT
behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive
psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated
by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation
($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By
decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation
analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance.
Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that
model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how
rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay
between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs
also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and
models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better
prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning
performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: SPIRE框架通过分解扩散模型为全局主干和轻量级客户端嵌入，实现高效联邦学习，理论证明其与最大似然估计的联系，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在联邦学习中因规模过大导致的个性化设备学习不可行问题。

Method: 将网络分解为全局主干和客户端嵌入，通过条件生成实现高效参数微调。

Result: SPIRE在协作预训练中表现优异，适应新客户端时显著优于基线，减少参数更新量。

Conclusion: SPIRE为扩散模型的联邦学习提供了高效、个性化的解决方案，并具备理论支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but
their sheer size makes on device personalization, and thus effective federated
learning (FL), infeasible. We propose Shared Backbone Personal Identity
Representation Embeddings (SPIRE), a framework that casts per client diffusion
based generation as conditional generation in FL. SPIRE factorizes the network
into (i) a high capacity global backbone that learns a population level score
function and (ii) lightweight, learnable client embeddings that encode local
data statistics. This separation enables parameter efficient finetuning that
touches $\leq 0.01\%$ of weights. We provide the first theoretical bridge
between conditional diffusion training and maximum likelihood estimation in
Gaussian mixture models. For a two component mixture we prove that gradient
descent on the DDPM with respect to mixing weights loss recovers the optimal
mixing weights and enjoys dimension free error bounds. Our analysis also hints
at how client embeddings act as biases that steer a shared score network toward
personalized distributions. Empirically, SPIRE matches or surpasses strong
baselines during collaborative pretraining, and vastly outperforms them when
adapting to unseen clients, reducing Kernel Inception Distance while updating
only hundreds of parameters. SPIRE further mitigates catastrophic forgetting
and remains robust across finetuning learning rate and epoch choices.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合观察数据和随机对照试验（RCT）数据的方法，用于估计条件平均处理效应（CATE），解决了隐藏混杂因素导致的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐藏混杂因素可能导致CATE估计偏差，而传统方法仅依赖观察数据无法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于伪混杂因素生成器和CATE模型的方法，通过将观察数据与RCT数据的学习结果对齐来估计CATE。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于隐私敏感场景（如医疗应用），并能有效减少隐藏混杂因素的影响。

Abstract: One of the major challenges in estimating conditional potential outcomes and
conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is the presence of hidden
confounders. Since testing for hidden confounders cannot be accomplished only
with observational data, conditional unconfoundedness is commonly assumed in
the literature of CATE estimation. Nevertheless, under this assumption, CATE
estimation can be significantly biased due to the effects of unobserved
confounders. In this work, we consider the case where in addition to a
potentially large observational dataset, a small dataset from a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) is available. Notably, we make no assumptions on the
existence of any covariate information for the RCT dataset, we only require the
outcomes to be observed. We propose a CATE estimation method based on a
pseudo-confounder generator and a CATE model that aligns the learned potential
outcomes from the observational data with those observed from the RCT. Our
method is applicable to many practical scenarios of interest, particularly
those where privacy is a concern (e.g., medical applications). Extensive
numerical experiments are provided demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach for both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 探索语言模型记忆模式的动态演变，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用细粒度指标分析Pythia模型家族在不同规模和训练步骤下的记忆行为，并引入前缀扰动。

Result: 发现模型规模增加会扩展记忆但降低效率，数据特性对记忆样本有差异影响，前缀扰动会减少记忆并增加不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对记忆机制的理解，对训练优化、隐私保护和架构改进有直接意义。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated a remarkable ability for verbatim
memorization. While numerous works have explored factors influencing model
memorization, the dynamic evolution memorization patterns remains
underexplored. This paper presents a detailed analysis of memorization in the
Pythia model family across varying scales and training steps under prefix
perturbations. Using granular metrics, we examine how model architecture, data
characteristics, and perturbations influence these patterns. Our findings
reveal that: (1) as model scale increases, memorization expands incrementally
while efficiency decreases rapidly; (2) as model scale increases, the rate of
new memorization acquisition decreases while old memorization forgetting
increases; (3) data characteristics (token frequency, repetition count, and
uncertainty) differentially affect memorized versus non-memorized samples; and
(4) prefix perturbations reduce memorization and increase generation
uncertainty proportionally to perturbation strength, with low-redundancy
samples showing higher vulnerability and larger models offering no additional
robustness. These findings advance our understanding of memorization
mechanisms, with direct implications for training optimization, privacy
safeguards, and architectural improvements.

Abstract: Data is crucial for machine learning (ML) applications, yet acquiring large
datasets can be costly and time-consuming, especially in complex,
resource-intensive fields like biopharmaceuticals. A key process in this
industry is upstream bioprocessing, where living cells are cultivated and
optimised to produce therapeutic proteins and biologics. The intricate nature
of these processes, combined with high resource demands, often limits data
collection, resulting in smaller datasets. This comprehensive review explores
ML methods designed to address the challenges posed by small data and
classifies them into a taxonomy to guide practical applications. Furthermore,
each method in the taxonomy was thoroughly analysed, with a detailed discussion
of its core concepts and an evaluation of its effectiveness in tackling small
data challenges, as demonstrated by application results in the upstream
bioprocessing and other related domains. By analysing how these methods tackle
small data challenges from different perspectives, this review provides
actionable insights, identifies current research gaps, and offers guidance for
leveraging ML in data-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在代码生成任务中表现优异，但难以生成高性能注意力算子代码，主要挑战在于无法理解复杂的数据流和计算过程，并利用低层原语优化GPU性能。

Method: 提出LLM-TL语言，结合两阶段推理工作流（TL代码生成与翻译），使LLMs能自动生成FlashAttention的GPU实现。

Result: 在A100、RTX8000和T4 GPU上验证，性能显著优于传统LLMs（最高35.16倍加速），并超越人工优化库（如cuDNN），同时支持未覆盖硬件和数据类型。

Conclusion: 该方法为注意力中心算法的高性能算子生成建立了自优化范式，将开发时间从数月缩短至分钟。

Abstract: The attention operator remains a critical performance bottleneck in large
language models (LLMs), particularly for long-context scenarios. While
FlashAttention is the most widely used and effective GPU-aware acceleration
algorithm, it must require time-consuming and hardware-specific manual
implementation, limiting adaptability across GPU architectures. Existing LLMs
have shown a lot of promise in code generation tasks, but struggle to generate
high-performance attention code. The key challenge is it cannot comprehend the
complex data flow and computation process of the attention operator and utilize
low-level primitive to exploit GPU performance.
  To address the above challenge, we propose an LLM-friendly Thinking Language
(LLM-TL) to help LLMs decouple the generation of high-level optimization logic
and low-level implementation on GPU, and enhance LLMs' understanding of
attention operator. Along with a 2-stage reasoning workflow, TL-Code generation
and translation, the LLMs can automatically generate FlashAttention
implementation on diverse GPUs, establishing a self-optimizing paradigm for
generating high-performance attention operators in attention-centric
algorithms. Verified on A100, RTX8000, and T4 GPUs, the performance of our
methods significantly outshines that of vanilla LLMs, achieving a speed-up of
up to 35.16x. Besides, our method not only surpasses human-optimized libraries
(cuDNN and official library) in most scenarios but also extends support to
unsupported hardware and data types, reducing development time from months to
minutes compared with human experts.

TL;DR: HYPER是一种用于知识超图链接预测的基础模型，能够泛化到包含新实体和新关系的知识超图，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理知识超图中新关系类型的预测问题，因此需要一种能够泛化到新实体和新关系的模型。

Method: 提出HYPER模型，通过编码超边中的实体及其位置，实现不同关系类型和不同元数的泛化学习。

Result: 在16个新数据集上的实验表明，HYPER在节点和关系归纳设置中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HYPER展示了强大的泛化能力，能够处理未见的高元数关系结构。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs is the task of
predicting missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities (i.e., nodes
unseen during training). Existing methods for inductive link prediction with
knowledge hypergraphs assume a fixed relational vocabulary and, as a result,
cannot generalize to knowledge hypergraphs with novel relation types (i.e.,
relations unseen during training). Inspired by knowledge graph foundation
models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can
generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and novel
relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation
types of varying arities, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with
their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16
new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse
range of relation types of varying arities. Empirically, HYPER consistently
outperforms all existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation
inductive settings, showing strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity
relational structures.

Motivation: 医疗设备（如脉搏血氧仪）的种族偏差可能导致治疗差异，但现有研究缺乏因果分析，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用路径特异性效应的因果推理方法，提出双稳健估计器的自归一化变体，并在半合成数据及真实数据集（MIMIC-IV和eICU）上验证。

Result: 种族差异对侵入性通气率影响较小，但对通气时长有显著影响，且不同数据集的结果存在差异。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种新的因果分析方法，强调了在医疗决策中评估公平性的重要性。

Abstract: Identifying and measuring biases associated with sensitive attributes is a
crucial consideration in healthcare to prevent treatment disparities. One
prominent issue is inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, which tend to
overestimate oxygen saturation for dark-skinned patients and misrepresent
supplemental oxygen needs. Most existing research has revealed statistical
disparities linking device errors to patient outcomes in intensive care units
(ICUs) without causal formalization. In contrast, this study causally
investigates how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements affect invasive
ventilation in ICU settings. We employ a causal inference-based approach using
path-specific effects to isolate the impact of bias by race on clinical
decision-making. To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust
estimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency,
and provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on
semi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets:
MIMIC-IV and eICU. Contrary to prior work, our analysis reveals minimal impact
of racial discrepancies on invasive ventilation rates. However, path-specific
effects mediated by oxygen saturation disparity are more pronounced on
ventilation duration, and the severity differs by dataset. Our work provides a
novel and practical pipeline for investigating potential disparities in the ICU
and, more crucially, highlights the necessity of causal methods to robustly
assess fairness in decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在关键应用中的普及，其安全性和对齐性成为重要挑战。现有研究多关注对抗性攻击，而忽视了良性交互中的非对抗性故障。

Method: 引入次级风险概念，定义两种风险原语（冗长响应和推测性建议），并提出SecLens框架进行多目标搜索以激发这些风险。

Result: 实验表明，次级风险普遍存在、可跨模型转移且与模态无关，现有安全机制难以应对。

Conclusion: 需增强安全机制以应对LLM在现实部署中的良性但有害行为。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant
challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and
societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak
attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly
emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class
of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign
prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect
generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic
evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative
advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions,
we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that
efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk
activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we
release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse
real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on
16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable
across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for
enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in
real-world deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能同时利用PCs的稀疏性和张量化操作的优势，限制了其扩展性。

Result: 在Text8、LM1B和ImageNet等基准测试中达到最先进的生成建模性能，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实践上均表现出色，显著提升了PCs的扩展性和计算效率。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are tractable representations of probability
distributions allowing for exact and efficient computation of likelihoods and
marginals. Recent advancements have improved the scalability of PCs either by
leveraging their sparse properties or through the use of tensorized operations
for better hardware utilization. However, no existing method fully exploits
both aspects simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse and
structured parameterization for the sum blocks in PCs. By replacing dense
matrices with sparse Monarch matrices, we significantly reduce the memory and
computation costs, enabling unprecedented scaling of PCs. From a theory
perspective, our construction arises naturally from circuit multiplication;
from a practical perspective, compared to previous efforts on scaling up
tractable probabilistic models, our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art
generative modeling performance on challenging benchmarks like Text8, LM1B and
ImageNet, but also demonstrates superior scaling behavior, achieving the same
performance with substantially less compute as measured by the number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNB算法在动态环境（如推荐系统中的用户偏好变化）中因神经网络参数僵化而丧失可塑性，限制了其适应性。

Method: 提出Selective Reinitialization（SeRe）框架，通过贡献效用指标动态重置未充分利用的神经网络单元，并结合自适应变化检测机制调整重置频率。

Result: 理论证明SeRe在分段静态环境中能实现次线性累积遗憾，实验表明其在六种真实推荐数据集上显著降低遗憾值。

Conclusion: SeRe有效解决了CNB的可塑性丧失问题，提升了算法在动态环境中的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Clustering of Bandits (CB) methods enhance sequential decision-making by
grouping bandits into clusters based on similarity and incorporating
cluster-level contextual information, demonstrating effectiveness and
adaptability in applications like personalized streaming recommendations.
However, when extending CB algorithms to their neural version (commonly
referred to as Clustering of Neural Bandits, or CNB), they suffer from loss of
plasticity, where neural network parameters become rigid and less adaptable
over time, limiting their ability to adapt to non-stationary environments
(e.g., dynamic user preferences in recommendation). To address this challenge,
we propose Selective Reinitialization (SeRe), a novel bandit learning framework
that dynamically preserves the adaptability of CNB algorithms in evolving
environments. SeRe leverages a contribution utility metric to identify and
selectively reset underutilized units, mitigating loss of plasticity while
maintaining stable knowledge retention. Furthermore, when combining SeRe with
CNB algorithms, the adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the
reinitialization frequency according to the degree of non-stationarity,
ensuring effective adaptation without unnecessary resets. Theoretically, we
prove that SeRe enables sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary
environments, outperforming traditional CNB approaches in long-term
performances. Extensive experiments on six real-world recommendation datasets
demonstrate that SeRe-enhanced CNB algorithms can effectively mitigate the loss
of plasticity with lower regrets, improving adaptability and robustness in
dynamic settings.

The use of single-lead ECG systems is crucial for portable devices, as they
offer convenience and accessibility for continuous monitoring in diverse
settings. However, the interpretability and reliability of deep learning models
in clinical applications poses challenges due to their black-box nature.
Methods: To address these challenges, we propose EXGnet, a single-lead,
trustworthy ECG arrhythmia classification network that integrates
multiresolution feature extraction with Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) guidance and train only quantitative features. Results: Trained on two
public datasets, including Chapman and Ningbo, EXGnet demonstrates superior
performance through key metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity, and
Specificity. The proposed method achieved average five fold accuracy of
98.762%, and 96.932% and average F1-score of 97.910%, and 95.527% on the
Chapman and Ningbo datasets, respectively. Conclusions: By employing XAI
techniques, specifically Grad-CAM, the model provides visual insights into the
relevant ECG segments it analyzes, thereby enhancing clinician trust in its
predictions. While quantitative features further improve classification
performance, they are not required during testing, making the model suitable
for real-world applications. Overall, EXGnet not only achieves better
classification accuracy but also addresses the critical need for
interpretability in deep learning, facilitating broader adoption in portable
ECG monitoring.

Motivation: 现实中的多视图数据通常存在类别不平衡，现有方法因无法感知和建模这种不平衡而导致性能下降。

Result: 实验表明，PROTOCOL在类别不平衡的多视图数据上显著提升了聚类性能。

Conclusion: PROTOCOL填补了类别不平衡多视图聚类的研究空白，为解决实际问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: While contrastive multi-view clustering has achieved remarkable success, it
implicitly assumes balanced class distribution. However, real-world multi-view
data primarily exhibits class imbalance distribution. Consequently, existing
methods suffer performance degradation due to their inability to perceive and
model such imbalance. To address this challenge, we present the first
systematic study of imbalanced multi-view clustering, focusing on two
fundamental problems: i. perceiving class imbalance distribution, and ii.
mitigating representation degradation of minority samples. We propose PROTOCOL,
a novel PaRtial Optimal TranspOrt-enhanced COntrastive Learning framework for
imbalanced multi-view clustering. First, for class imbalance perception, we map
multi-view features into a consensus space and reformulate the imbalanced
clustering as a partial optimal transport (POT) problem, augmented with
progressive mass constraints and weighted KL divergence for class
distributions. Second, we develop a POT-enhanced class-rebalanced contrastive
learning at both feature and class levels, incorporating logit adjustment and
class-sensitive learning to enhance minority sample representations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PROTOCOL significantly improves clustering
performance on imbalanced multi-view data, filling a critical research gap in
this field.

suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics.
Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain
setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts.
Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data
incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target
domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of
cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty
that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies
ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from
three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series
interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both
domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing
informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based
imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and
captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising
networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency
alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain
discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving
domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code
implementation is available here.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件生成扩散模型和最大后验估计的新型无线信道场景识别方法，显著提升了识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于统计特征的信道场景识别方法无法准确区分动态散射体引起的隐含特征，导致在相似场景中表现不佳。

Abstract: The identification of channel scenarios in wireless systems plays a crucial
role in channel modeling, radio fingerprint positioning, and transceiver
design. Traditional methods to classify channel scenarios are based on typical
statistical characteristics of channels, such as K-factor, path loss, delay
spread, etc. However, statistic-based channel identification methods cannot
accurately differentiate implicit features induced by dynamic scatterers, thus
performing very poorly in identifying similar channel scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel channel scenario identification method, formulating the
identification task as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Furthermore,
the MAP estimation is reformulated by a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE),
which is then approximated and solved by the conditional generative diffusion
model. Specifically, we leverage a transformer network to capture hidden
channel features in multiple latent noise spaces within the reverse process of
the conditional generative diffusion model. These detailed features, which
directly affect likelihood functions in MLE, enable highly accurate scenario
identification. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
traditional methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs), and random forest-based classifiers,
improving the identification accuracy by more than 10%.

Motivation: 解决当前CRL方法无法将潜在因素与已知生物过程结合的问题，提升模型的解释性。

Method: 基于discrepancy-VAE，提出SENA-discrepancy-VAE模型，通过SENA-δ编码器将生物过程活动映射到潜在因果因素。

Conclusion: SENA-discrepancy-VAE成功平衡了模型的可解释性与预测性能，为基因组和药物扰动研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Predicting the impact of genomic and drug perturbations in cellular function
is crucial for understanding gene functions and drug effects, ultimately
leading to improved therapies. To this end, Causal Representation Learning
(CRL) constitutes one of the most promising approaches, as it aims to identify
the latent factors that causally govern biological systems, thus facilitating
the prediction of the effect of unseen perturbations. Yet, current CRL methods
fail in reconciling their principled latent representations with known
biological processes, leading to models that are not interpretable. To address
this major issue, we present SENA-discrepancy-VAE, a model based on the
recently proposed CRL method discrepancy-VAE, that produces representations
where each latent factor can be interpreted as the (linear) combination of the
activity of a (learned) set of biological processes. To this extent, we present
an encoder, SENA-{\delta}, that efficiently compute and map biological
processes' activity levels to the latent causal factors. We show that
SENA-discrepancy-VAE achieves predictive performances on unseen combinations of
interventions that are comparable with its original, non-interpretable
counterpart, while inferring causal latent factors that are biologically
meaningful.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计有效的奖励函数是强化学习中的关键挑战，传统方法依赖人类反馈，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: ERL-VLM通过查询视觉语言模型（VLM）对轨迹的绝对评分，取代了传统的成对比较方法，并改进了数据不平衡和噪声标签带来的不稳定性。

Conclusion: ERL-VLM展示了AI反馈在减少人类干预下扩展强化学习的潜力，为更自主和高效的奖励学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a fundamental challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), as it often requires extensive human effort and
domain expertise. While RL from human feedback has been successful in aligning
agents with human intent, acquiring high-quality feedback is costly and
labor-intensive, limiting its scalability. Recent advancements in foundation
models present a promising alternative--leveraging AI-generated feedback to
reduce reliance on human supervision in reward learning. Building on this
paradigm, we introduce ERL-VLM, an enhanced rating-based RL method that
effectively learns reward functions from AI feedback. Unlike prior methods that
rely on pairwise comparisons, ERL-VLM queries large vision-language models
(VLMs) for absolute ratings of individual trajectories, enabling more
expressive feedback and improved sample efficiency. Additionally, we propose
key enhancements to rating-based RL, addressing instability issues caused by
data imbalance and noisy labels. Through extensive experiments across both
low-level and high-level control tasks, we demonstrate that ERL-VLM
significantly outperforms existing VLM-based reward generation methods. Our
results demonstrate the potential of AI feedback for scaling RL with minimal
human intervention, paving the way for more autonomous and efficient reward
learning.

Conclusion: Merlin能有效增强现有模型对不固定缺失率的鲁棒性，同时保持预测准确性。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) involves predicting future values
of multiple interrelated time series. Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models
have gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics
(global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are
pervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data
collectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but
their distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack
robustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To
this end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning
(Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between
incomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations
in MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge
distillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher
model to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete
observations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations. The
latter improves the student model's robustness by learning from
positive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with
different missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing
rates. Therefore, Merlin is capable of effectively enhancing the robustness of
existing models against unfixed missing rates while preserving forecasting
accuracy. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority
of Merlin.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
node classification tasks but struggle with label noise in real-world data.
Existing studies on graph learning with label noise commonly rely on
class-dependent label noise, overlooking the complexities of instance-dependent
noise and falling short of capturing real-world corruption patterns. We
introduce BeGIN (Benchmarking for Graphs with Instance-dependent Noise), a new
benchmark that provides realistic graph datasets with various noise types and
comprehensively evaluates noise-handling strategies across GNN architectures,
noisy label detection, and noise-robust learning. To simulate
instance-dependent corruptions, BeGIN introduces algorithmic methods and
LLM-based simulations. Our experiments reveal the challenges of
instance-dependent noise, particularly LLM-based corruption, and underscore the
importance of node-specific parameterization to enhance GNN robustness. By
comprehensively evaluating noise-handling strategies, BeGIN provides insights
into their effectiveness, efficiency, and key performance factors. We expect
that BeGIN will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research on label
noise in graphs and fostering the development of robust GNN training methods.

This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that

generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other IRL-based
method.

Motivation: 状态空间模型（SSMs）在边缘AI应用中具有潜力，但量化对其性能的影响尚未充分研究。本文旨在探索量化对SSMs的影响，并提出优化方法。

Method: 使用S4D架构，首先分析后训练量化（PTQ）对状态矩阵A和内部状态x的敏感性，然后应用量化感知训练（QAT）提升性能。还提出了异构量化策略。

Result: QAT将性能从PTQ的40%提升到96%（8位精度），异构量化策略将内存占用减少6倍且不损失性能。

Conclusion: 量化感知训练和异构量化策略为在资源受限环境中部署量化SSMs提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently gained attention in deep learning for
their ability to efficiently model long-range dependencies, making them
promising candidates for edge-AI applications. In this paper, we analyze the
effects of quantization on small-scale SSMs with a focus on reducing memory and
computational costs while maintaining task performance. Using the S4D
architecture, we first investigate post-training quantization (PTQ) and show
that the state matrix A and internal state x are particularly sensitive to
quantization. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different quantization
techniques applied to the parameters and activations in the S4D architecture.
To address the observed performance drop after Post-training Quantization
(PTQ), we apply Quantization-aware Training (QAT), significantly improving
performance from 40% (PTQ) to 96% on the sequential MNIST benchmark at 8-bit
precision. We further demonstrate the potential of QAT in enabling sub-8-bit
precisions and evaluate different parameterization schemes for QAT stability.
Additionally, we propose a heterogeneous quantization strategy that assigns
different precision levels to model components, reducing the overall memory
footprint by a factor of 6x without sacrificing performance. Our results
provide actionable insights for deploying quantized SSMs in
resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型即使经过安全微调仍可能保留危险知识和技能，现有遗忘方法易被逆转，需开发更鲁棒的遗忘技术。

Method: 引入Disruption Masking技术，仅更新梯度符号一致的权重；结合梯度归一化和元学习，形成MUDMAN方法。

Result: MUDMAN比现有TAR方法性能提升40%，成为鲁棒遗忘的新标杆。

Conclusion: MUDMAN通过不可逆遗忘技术显著提升了模型安全性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after
extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent
studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed.
To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components
of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.
  We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating
weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient
are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.
  Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients,
and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights
into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and
validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous
capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40\%, setting a new
state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

Motivation: 探索FTPL在组合半强盗问题中的最优性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 采用几何重采样（GR）和条件几何重采样（CGR）方法，分析其在尺寸不变半强盗设置中的表现。

Result: FTPL在Fr\'{e}chet分布下达到$O\left(\sqrt{m^2 d^\frac{1}{\alpha}T}+\sqrt{mdT}\right)$遗憾界，在Pareto分布下达到最优$O\left(\sqrt{mdT}\right)$遗憾界。CGR将计算复杂度从$O(d^2)$降至$O\left(md\left(\log(d/m)+1\right)\right)$。

Conclusion: FTPL在组合半强盗问题中具有最优性和高效性，CGR进一步提升了计算效率。

Abstract: This paper studies the optimality and complexity of
Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy in size-invariant combinatorial
semi-bandit problems. Recently, Honda et al. (2023) and Lee et al. (2024)
showed that FTPL achieves Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) optimality in standard
multi-armed bandit problems with Fr\'{e}chet-type distributions. However, the
optimality of FTPL in combinatorial semi-bandit problems remains unclear. In
this paper, we consider the regret bound of FTPL with geometric resampling (GR)
in size-invariant semi-bandit setting, showing that FTPL respectively achieves
$O\left(\sqrt{m^2 d^\frac{1}{\alpha}T}+\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ regret with
Fr\'{e}chet distributions, and the best possible regret bound of
$O\left(\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ with Pareto distributions in adversarial setting.
Furthermore, we extend the conditional geometric resampling (CGR) to
size-invariant semi-bandit setting, which reduces the computational complexity
from $O(d^2)$ of original GR to $O\left(md\left(\log(d/m)+1\right)\right)$
without sacrificing the regret performance of FTPL.

Result: 在连续控制离线RL基准测试中表现优于基线，并展示了在多任务中的灵活性。

Conclusion: SARA是一种简单且鲁棒的PbRL方法，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) entails a variety of
approaches for aligning models with human intent to alleviate the burden of
reward engineering. However, most previous PbRL work has not investigated the
robustness to labeler errors, inevitable with labelers who are non-experts or
operate under time constraints. Additionally, PbRL algorithms often target very
specific settings (e.g. pairwise ranked preferences or purely offline
learning). We introduce Similarity as Reward Alignment (SARA), a simple
contrastive framework that is both resilient to noisy labels and adaptable to
diverse feedback formats and training paradigms. SARA learns a latent
representation of preferred samples and computes rewards as similarities to the
learned latent. We demonstrate strong performance compared to baselines on
continuous control offline RL benchmarks. We further demonstrate SARA's
versatility in applications such as trajectory filtering for downstream tasks,
cross-task preference transfer, and reward shaping in online learning.

Conclusion: BSA为不规则几何结构提供了一种高效的稀疏注意力解决方案。

Abstract: Self-attention scales quadratically with input size, limiting its use for
large-scale physical systems. Although sparse attention mechanisms provide a
viable alternative, they are primarily designed for regular structures such as
text or images, making them inapplicable for irregular geometries. In this
work, we present Ball Sparse Attention (BSA), which adapts Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) (Yuan et al., 2025) to unordered point sets by imposing
regularity using the Ball Tree structure from the Erwin Transformer (Zhdanov et
al., 2025). We modify NSA's components to work with ball-based neighborhoods,
yielding a global receptive field at sub-quadratic cost. On an airflow pressure
prediction task, we achieve accuracy comparable to Full Attention while
significantly reducing the theoretical computational complexity. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/britacatalin/bsa.

Conclusion: PLD通过优化教师模型的完整排序，提供了一种更高效的知识蒸馏方法，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact
"student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger
"teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de
facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically
this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a
correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in
every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must
be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and
recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting
teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation
(PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers
knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its
own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the
true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher
confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes
weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification
benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST
(arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous
settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in
heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: 通过随机微分方程模型，揭示了批量大小对训练动态的影响，为理解优化器差距提供了新视角。

Abstract: Adam is known to perform significantly better than Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD) in language models, a phenomenon for which a number of
explanations have been proposed. In this work, we revisit this "optimizer gap"
through a series of comprehensively tuned baseline training runs for language
modeling with Transformers. We exhaustively study how momentum, gradient
clipping, and batch size affect the gap between SGD and Adam. Our empirical
findings show that SGD with momentum can actually perform similarly to Adam in
small-batch settings, if tuned correctly. We revisit existing explanations for
Adam's advantage, including heavy-tailed class imbalance, directional
sharpness, and Hessian heterogeneity, which struggle to directly explain this
phenomenon. Towards bridging this gap in our understanding, by analyzing our
Transformer training runs and simple quadratic settings inspired by the
literature, we provide new insights, driven by stochastic differential equation
models, into the role of batch size on the training dynamics.

Conclusion: 高斯机制在DP学习中广泛适用，优化β值对性能提升有限，支持其作为默认选择。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is obtained by randomizing a data analysis
algorithm, which necessarily introduces a tradeoff between its utility and
privacy. Many DP mechanisms are built upon one of two underlying tools: Laplace
and Gaussian additive noise mechanisms. We expand the search space of
algorithms by investigating the Generalized Gaussian mechanism, which samples
the additive noise term $x$ with probability proportional to $e^{-\frac{| x
|}{\sigma}^{\beta} }$ for some $\beta \geq 1$. The Laplace and Gaussian
mechanisms are special cases of GG for $\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$, respectively.
  In this work, we prove that all members of the GG family satisfy differential
privacy, and provide an extension of an existing numerical accountant (the PRV
accountant) for these mechanisms. We show that privacy accounting for the GG
Mechanism and its variants is dimension independent, which substantially
improves computational costs of privacy accounting.
  We apply the GG mechanism to two canonical tools for private machine
learning, PATE and DP-SGD; we show empirically that $\beta$ has a weak
relationship with test-accuracy, and that generally $\beta=2$ (Gaussian) is
nearly optimal. This provides justification for the widespread adoption of the
Gaussian mechanism in DP learning, and can be interpreted as a negative result,
that optimizing over $\beta$ does not lead to meaningful improvements in
performance.

Result: 研究发现当前公平性研究存在不足，需结合社会背景以更全面地解决偏见问题。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁在机器学习公平性研究中更注重明确定义的度量和社会因素的整合。

Abstract: Enhancing fairness in machine learning (ML) systems is increasingly important
nowadays. While current research focuses on assistant tools for ML pipelines to
promote fairness within them, we argue that: 1) The significance of properly
defined fairness measures remains underestimated; and 2) Fairness research in
ML should integrate societal considerations. The reasons include that detecting
discrimination is critical due to the widespread deployment of ML systems and
that human-AI feedback loops amplify biases, even when only small social and
political biases persist.

Conclusion: RAW-Explainer为知识图谱链接预测提供了一种高效且可解释的解释生成方法。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on
knowledge graph tasks such as link prediction. However, interpreting GNN
predictions remains a challenging open problem. While many GNN explainability
methods have been proposed for node or graph-level tasks, approaches for
generating explanations for link predictions in heterogeneous settings are
limited. In this paper, we propose RAW-Explainer, a novel framework designed to
generate connected, concise, and thus interpretable subgraph explanations for
link prediction. Our method leverages the heterogeneous information in
knowledge graphs to identify connected subgraphs that serve as patterns of
factual explanation via a random walk objective. Unlike existing methods
tailored to knowledge graphs, our approach employs a neural network to
parameterize the explanation generation process, which significantly speeds up
the production of collective explanations. Furthermore, RAW-Explainer is
designed to overcome the distribution shift issue when evaluating the quality
of an explanatory subgraph which is orders of magnitude smaller than the full
graph, by proposing a robust evaluator that generalizes to the subgraph
distribution. Extensive quantitative results on real-world knowledge graph
datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a balance between explanation
quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent work has questioned the reliability of graph learning benchmarks,
citing concerns around task design, methodological rigor, and data suitability.
In this extended abstract, we contribute to this discussion by focusing on
evaluation strategies in Temporal Link Prediction (TLP). We observe that
current evaluation protocols are often affected by one or more of the following
issues: (1) inconsistent sampled metrics, (2) reliance on hard negative
sampling often introduced as a means to improve robustness, and (3) metrics
that implicitly assume equal base probabilities across source nodes by
combining predictions. We support these claims through illustrative examples
and connections to longstanding concerns in the recommender systems community.
Our ongoing work aims to systematically characterize these problems and explore
alternatives that can lead to more robust and interpretable evaluation. We
conclude with a discussion of potential directions for improving the
reliability of TLP benchmarks.

an end-to-end algorithm designed to fine-tune a dense pre-trained Large

multiple specialized domains. During instruction-tuning, SIMoE automatically
identifies multiple specialized experts under a specified sparsity constraint,
with each expert representing a structurally sparse subset of the seed LLM's
parameters that correspond to domain-specific knowledge within the data. SIMoE
simultaneously learns an input-dependent expert merging strategy via a router
network, leveraging rich cross-expert knowledge for superior downstream
generalization that surpasses existing baselines. Empirically, SIMoE
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on common instruction-tuning
benchmarks while maintaining an optimal performance-compute trade-off compared

Motivation: 深度强化学习在现实应用中常因环境不确定性而受限，现有鲁棒RL算法多限于表格设置，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出DR-SAC算法，通过最大化熵值对抗最坏可能的转移模型，并利用生成建模估计未知名义分布。

Result: 在连续控制基准任务中，DR-SAC的平均奖励比SAC基线高9.8倍，且计算效率和可扩展性显著优于现有鲁棒RL算法。

Conclusion: DR-SAC是一种高效且可扩展的鲁棒强化学习算法，适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success, yet its
application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by a lack of robustness
to environmental uncertainties. To solve this challenge, some robust RL
algorithms have been proposed, but most are limited to tabular settings. In
this work, we propose Distributionally Robust Soft Actor-Critic (DR-SAC), a
novel algorithm designed to enhance the robustness of the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. DR-SAC aims to maximize the expected value with
entropy against the worst possible transition model lying in an uncertainty
set. A distributionally robust version of the soft policy iteration is derived
with a convergence guarantee. For settings where nominal distributions are
unknown, such as offline RL, a generative modeling approach is proposed to
estimate the required nominal distributions from data. Furthermore,
experimental results on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks
demonstrate our algorithm achieves up to $9.8$ times the average reward of the
SAC baseline under common perturbations. Additionally, compared with existing
robust reinforcement learning algorithms, DR-SAC significantly improves
computing efficiency and applicability to large-scale problems.

Conclusion: 神经接口有望推动人机交互、辅助AI和自适应系统的未来发展。

Abstract: Implicit Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HITL-RL) is a methodology
that integrates passive human feedback into autonomous agent training while
minimizing human workload. However, existing methods often rely on active
instruction, requiring participants to teach an agent through unnatural
expression or gesture. We introduce NEURO-LOOP, an implicit feedback framework
that utilizes the intrinsic human reward system to drive human-agent
interaction. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a critical first step in
the NEURO-LOOP framework: mapping brain signals to agent performance. Using
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we design a dataset to enable
future research using passive Brain-Computer Interfaces for Human-in-the-Loop
Reinforcement Learning. Participants are instructed to observe or guide a
reinforcement learning agent in its environment while signals from the
prefrontal cortex are collected. We conclude that a relationship between fNIRS
data and agent performance exists using classical machine learning techniques.
Finally, we highlight the potential that neural interfaces may offer to future
applications of human-agent interaction, assistive AI, and adaptive autonomous
systems.

Abstract: Many real-world physics and engineering problems arise in geometrically
complex domains discretized by meshes for numerical simulations. The nodes of
these potentially irregular meshes naturally form point clouds whose limited
tractability poses significant challenges for learning mappings via machine
learning models. To address this, we introduce a novel and parameter-free
encoding scheme that aggregates footprints of points onto grid vertices and
yields information-rich grid representations of the topology. Such structured
representations are well-suited for standard convolution and FFT (Fast Fourier
Transform) operations and enable efficient learning of mappings between encoded
input-output pairs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we
integrate our encoder with a uniquely designed UNet (E-UNet) and benchmark its
performance against Fourier- and transformer-based models across diverse 2D and
3D problems where we analyze the performance in terms of predictive accuracy,
data efficiency, and noise robustness. Furthermore, we highlight the
versatility of our encoding scheme in various mapping tasks including
recovering full point cloud responses from partial observations. Our proposed
framework offers a practical alternative to both primitive and computationally
intensive encoding schemes; supporting broad adoption in computational science
applications involving mesh-based simulations.

TL;DR: TFKAN是一种结合时间和频率域的KAN网络，用于长期时间序列预测，通过双分支架构和维度调整策略显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KAN研究主要关注时间域，忽略了频率域中周期性模式的价值。

Method: 提出TFKAN，采用双分支处理时间和频率域，引入维度调整策略优化频率信息。

Result: TFKAN在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TFKAN通过结合双域信息，显著提升了长期时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are highly effective in long-term time
series forecasting due to their ability to efficiently represent nonlinear
relationships and exhibit local plasticity. However, prior research on KANs has
predominantly focused on the time domain, neglecting the potential of the
frequency domain. The frequency domain of time series data reveals recurring
patterns and periodic behaviors, which complement the temporal information
captured in the time domain. To address this gap, we explore the application of
KANs in the frequency domain for long-term time series forecasting. By
leveraging KANs' adaptive activation functions and their comprehensive
representation of signals in the frequency domain, we can more effectively
learn global dependencies and periodic patterns. To integrate information from
both time and frequency domains, we propose the
$\textbf{T}$ime-$\textbf{F}$requency KAN (TFKAN). TFKAN employs a dual-branch
architecture that independently processes features from each domain, ensuring
that the distinct characteristics of each domain are fully utilized without
interference. Additionally, to account for the heterogeneity between domains,
we introduce a dimension-adjustment strategy that selectively upscales only in
the frequency domain, enhancing efficiency while capturing richer frequency
information. Experimental results demonstrate that TFKAN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple datasets. The code
is available at https://github.com/LcWave/TFKAN.

Abstract: Notification recommendation systems are critical to driving user engagement
on professional platforms like LinkedIn. Designing such systems involves
integrating heterogeneous signals across domains, capturing temporal dynamics,
and optimizing for multiple, often competing, objectives. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex interactions in such
environments. In this paper, we present a cross-domain GNN-based system
deployed at LinkedIn that unifies user, content, and activity signals into a
single, large-scale graph. By training on this cross-domain structure, our
model significantly outperforms single-domain baselines on key tasks, including
click-through rate (CTR) prediction and professional engagement. We introduce
architectural innovations including temporal modeling and multi-task learning,
which further enhance performance. Deployed in LinkedIn's notification system,
our approach led to a 0.10% lift in weekly active users and a 0.62% improvement
in CTR. We detail our graph construction process, model design, training
pipeline, and both offline and online evaluations. Our work demonstrates the
scalability and effectiveness of cross-domain GNNs in real-world, high-impact
applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is playing an increasingly important role in
fields such as robotic control and autonomous driving. However, the gap between
simulation and the real environment remains a major obstacle to the practical
deployment of RL. Agents trained in simulators often struggle to maintain
performance when transferred to real-world physical environments. In this
paper, we propose a latent space based approach to analyze the impact of
simulation on real-world policy improvement in model-based settings. As a
natural extension of model-based methods, our approach enables an intuitive
observation of the challenges faced by model-based methods in sim-to-real
transfer. Experiments conducted in the MuJoCo environment evaluate the
performance of our method in both measuring and mitigating the sim-to-real gap.
The experiments also highlight the various challenges that remain in overcoming
the sim-to-real gap, especially for model-based methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对无线联邦学习的通道原生比特翻转差分隐私机制，利用通信噪声保护隐私，避免了浮点数传输中的灾难性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字通信系统主要使用浮点数标准（如IEEE 754）存储和传输数据，但浮点数的比特错误可能导致灾难性后果（如符号或指数位错误），而通信噪声的隐私保护潜力被忽视。

Method: 设计了一种新的浮点数到定点数转换方法，仅传输模型参数的小数部分比特，避免符号和指数位传输；将比特扰动和通信噪声解释为比特翻转差分隐私过程。

Result: 提出的机制满足(λ,ε)-Rényi差分隐私，且不影响联邦学习的收敛性，实验验证了其优于现有高斯噪声机制。

Conclusion: 该机制通过利用通信噪声和比特翻转，有效保护隐私并避免浮点数传输的潜在风险，为无线联邦学习提供了更优的隐私保护方案。

Abstract: Inherent communication noises have the potential to preserve privacy for
wireless federated learning (WFL) but have been overlooked in digital
communication systems predominantly using floating-point number standards,
e.g., IEEE 754, for data storage and transmission. This is due to the
potentially catastrophic consequences of bit errors in floating-point numbers,
e.g., on the sign or exponent bits. This paper presents a novel channel-native
bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where
transmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to
collectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The
key idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors
caused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved
by designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only
transmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating
the need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the
catastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the
bit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed
mechanism satisfies (\lambda,\epsilon)-R\'enyi DP and does not violate the WFL
convergence. Experiments validate privacy and convergence analysis of the
proposed mechanism and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art
Gaussian mechanisms that are channel-agnostic and add Gaussian noise for
privacy protection.

TL;DR: AFBS是一种在异步联邦学习中通过梯度选择和隐私保护提升性能的算法，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步联邦学习（AFL）因无需等待慢速节点而加速训练，但梯度陈旧性会降低性能。现有解决方案通过梯度缓冲区形成半异步框架，但无法有效处理大量陈旧梯度。

Method: 提出AFBS算法，通过随机投影加密标签分布矩阵进行客户端聚类，服务器基于信息价值评分和选择梯度，丢弃低价值梯度。

Result: 在高度异构的系统与数据环境中，AFBS在CIFAR-100任务上比现有最佳算法准确率提升4.8%，达到目标精度时间减少75%。

Conclusion: AFBS通过梯度选择和隐私保护有效提升了半异步联邦学习的性能，适用于异构环境。

Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) accelerates training by eliminating the
need to wait for stragglers, but its asynchronous nature introduces gradient
staleness, where outdated gradients degrade performance. Existing solutions
address this issue with gradient buffers, forming a semi-asynchronous
framework. However, this approach struggles when buffers accumulate numerous
stale gradients, as blindly aggregating all gradients can harm training. To
address this, we propose AFBS (Asynchronous FL Buffer Selection), the first
algorithm to perform gradient selection within buffers while ensuring privacy
protection. Specifically, the client sends the random projection encrypted
label distribution matrix before training, and the server performs client
clustering based on it. During training, server scores and selects gradients
within each cluster based on their informational value, discarding low-value
gradients to enhance semi-asynchronous federated learning. Extensive
experiments in highly heterogeneous system and data environments demonstrate
AFBS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on
the most challenging task, CIFAR-100, AFBS improves accuracy by up to 4.8% over
the previous best algorithm and reduces the time to reach target accuracy by
75%.

Result: 在Temporal Graph Benchmark上表现优异，甚至在某些数据集上超越深度模型。

Conclusion: Base3为时序图学习提供了一种简单且鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Dynamic link prediction remains a central challenge in temporal graph
learning, particularly in designing models that are both effective and
practical for real-world deployment. Existing approaches often rely on complex
neural architectures, which are computationally intensive and difficult to
interpret.
  In this work, we build on the strong recurrence-based foundation of the
EdgeBank baseline, by supplementing it with inductive capabilities. We do so by
leveraging the predictive power of non-learnable signals from two complementary
perspectives: historical edge recurrence, as captured by EdgeBank, and global
node popularity, as introduced in the PopTrack model. We propose t-CoMem, a
lightweight memory module that tracks temporal co-occurrence patterns and
neighborhood activity. Building on this, we introduce Base3, an
interpolation-based model that fuses EdgeBank, PopTrack, and t-CoMem into a
unified scoring framework. This combination effectively bridges local and
global temporal dynamics -- repetition, popularity, and context -- without
relying on training. Evaluated on the Temporal Graph Benchmark, Base3 achieves
performance competitive with state-of-the-art deep models, even outperforming
them on some datasets. Importantly, it considerably improves on existing
baselines' performance under more realistic and challenging negative sampling
strategies -- offering a simple yet robust alternative for temporal graph
learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线学习中梯度反馈可能被污染（如异常值、错误标签或恶意干扰）的问题，尤其是在无约束条件下现有算法表现不佳的情况。

Method: 设计了两种算法：一种在已知梯度上界G时保证遗憾为$\|u\|G (\sqrt{T} + k)$；另一种在G未知时额外增加惩罚项$(\|u\|^2+G^2) k$。

Result: 算法在无约束条件下有效降低了遗憾，即使存在污染。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在梯度污染情况下具有鲁棒性，适用于无约束在线学习场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses online learning with ``corrupted'' feedback. Our learner
is provided with potentially corrupted gradients $\tilde g_t$ instead of the
``true'' gradients $g_t$. We make no assumptions about how the corruptions
arise: they could be the result of outliers, mislabeled data, or even malicious
interference. We focus on the difficult ``unconstrained'' setting in which our
algorithm must maintain low regret with respect to any comparison point $u \in
\mathbb{R}^d$. The unconstrained setting is significantly more challenging as
existing algorithms suffer extremely high regret even with very tiny amounts of
corruption (which is not true in the case of a bounded domain). Our algorithms
guarantee regret $ \|u\|G (\sqrt{T} + k) $ when $G \ge \max_t \|g_t\|$ is
known, where $k$ is a measure of the total amount of corruption. When $G$ is
unknown we incur an extra additive penalty of $(\|u\|^2+G^2) k$.

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅提高了表示质量，还能在不重新训练的情况下支持前向和逆向推理任务。

Conclusion: GFM和PDEfuncta为科学机器学习中的高频特征表示和多任务泛化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning often involves representing complex solution
fields that exhibit high-frequency features such as sharp transitions,
fine-scale oscillations, and localized structures. While implicit neural
representations (INRs) have shown promise for continuous function modeling,
capturing such high-frequency behavior remains a challenge-especially when
modeling multiple solution fields with a shared network. Prior work addressing
spectral bias in INRs has primarily focused on single-instance settings,
limiting scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose Global
Fourier Modulation (GFM), a novel modulation technique that injects
high-frequency information at each layer of the INR through Fourier-based
reparameterization. This enables compact and accurate representation of
multiple solution fields using low-dimensional latent vectors. Building upon
GFM, we introduce PDEfuncta, a meta-learning framework designed to learn
multi-modal solution fields and support generalization to new tasks. Through
empirical studies on diverse scientific problems, we demonstrate that our
method not only improves representational quality but also shows potential for
forward and inverse inference tasks without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical and practical problem in many
real-world applications, especially for industrial scenarios, where load
forecasting underpins the intelligent operation of modern systems like clouds,
power grids and traffic networks.However, the inherent complexity and dynamics
of these systems present significant challenges. Despite advances in methods
such as pattern recognition and anti-non-stationarity have led to performance
gains, current methods fail to consistently ensure effectiveness across various
system scenarios due to the intertwined issues of complex patterns,
concept-drift, and few-shot problems. To address these challenges
simultaneously, we introduce a novel scheme centered on fundamental waveform,
a.k.a., meta-pattern. Specifically, we develop a unique Meta-pattern Pooling
mechanism to purify and maintain meta-patterns, capturing the nuanced nature of
system loads. Complementing this, the proposed Echo mechanism adaptively
leverages the meta-patterns, enabling a flexible and precise pattern
reconstruction. Our Meta-pattern Echo transformer (MetaEformer) seamlessly
incorporates these mechanisms with the transformer-based predictor, offering
end-to-end efficiency and interpretability of core processes. Demonstrating
superior performance across eight benchmarks under three system scenarios,
MetaEformer marks a significant advantage in accuracy, with a 37% relative
improvement on fifteen state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨长期预测问题在时间序列分析中的重要性，以及如何通过深度学习方法改进预测性能。

Method: 结合趋势、季节性、傅里叶变换等技术，使用卷积、注意力机制等深度学习方法，并在ETTm2数据集上进行消融实验。

Result: 实验表明，除xLSTM和Triformer模型外，预测误差随预测长度增加而上升，验证了LHF的误差传播特性。

Conclusion: 长期预测问题本质上是误差传播问题，需进一步优化模型以减少误差累积。

Abstract: The long horizon forecasting (LHF) problem has come up in the time series
literature for over the last 35 years or so. This review covers aspects of LHF
in this period and how deep learning has incorporated variants of trend,
seasonality, fourier and wavelet transforms, misspecification bias reduction
and bandpass filters while contributing using convolutions, residual
connections, sparsity reduction, strided convolutions, attention masks, SSMs,
normalization methods, low-rank approximations and gating mechanisms. We
highlight time series decomposition techniques, input data preprocessing and
dataset windowing schemes that improve performance. Multi-layer perceptron
models, recurrent neural network hybrids, self-attention models that improve
and/or address the performances of the LHF problem are described, with an
emphasis on the feature space construction. Ablation studies are conducted over
the ETTm2 dataset in the multivariate and univariate high useful load (HUFL)
forecasting contexts, evaluated over the last 4 months of the dataset. The
heatmaps of MSE averages per time step over test set series in the horizon show
that there is a steady increase in the error proportionate to its length except
with xLSTM and Triformer models and motivate LHF as an error propagation
problem. The trained models are available here: https://bit.ly/LHFModelZoo

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Lyapunov Learning的新训练算法，用于处理深度学习中非平稳时间序列和范式转换的挑战，通过非线性混沌动力系统特性实现模型快速适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习中，新信息的引入可能破坏已有数据并改变模型范式，尤其在非平稳数据源下，神经网络需快速适应新范式同时保留关键历史知识。

Method: 利用非线性混沌动力系统特性，结合Stuart Kauffman的Adjacent Possible理论，使神经网络在混沌边缘运行，最大Lyapunov指数随时间围绕零演化。

Result: 在非平稳系统的范式转换实验中表现优异，特别是在Lorenz混沌系统参数突变场景下，Lyapunov Learning显著优于常规训练，损失比提升约96%。

Conclusion: Lyapunov Learning为处理非平稳数据和范式转换提供了一种有效方法，显著提升了神经网络的适应能力和性能。

Abstract: Handling regime shifts and non-stationary time series in deep learning
systems presents a significant challenge. In the case of online learning, when
new information is introduced, it can disrupt previously stored data and alter
the model's overall paradigm, especially with non-stationary data sources.
Therefore, it is crucial for neural systems to quickly adapt to new paradigms
while preserving essential past knowledge relevant to the overall problem. In
this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm for neural networks called
\textit{Lyapunov Learning}. This approach leverages the properties of nonlinear
chaotic dynamical systems to prepare the model for potential regime shifts.
Drawing inspiration from Stuart Kauffman's Adjacent Possible theory, we
leverage local unexplored regions of the solution space to enable flexible
adaptation. The neural network is designed to operate at the edge of chaos,
where the maximum Lyapunov exponent, indicative of a system's sensitivity to
small perturbations, evolves around zero over time.
  Our approach demonstrates effective and significant improvements in
experiments involving regime shifts in non-stationary systems. In particular,
we train a neural network to deal with an abrupt change in Lorenz's chaotic
system parameters. The neural network equipped with Lyapunov learning
significantly outperforms the regular training, increasing the loss ratio by
about $96\%$.

TL;DR: FlowRL是一个新颖的在线强化学习框架，结合了基于流的策略表示和Wasserstein-2正则化优化，通过增强策略类的表达能力提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流训练与强化学习目标不匹配，FlowRL旨在解决这一问题，通过动态缓冲实现价值驱动的策略优化。

Method: FlowRL通过状态依赖的速度场建模策略，从噪声中生成动作，并联合优化Q值和Wasserstein-2距离。

Result: 在DMControl和Humanoidbench上的实验表明，FlowRL在在线强化学习基准中表现优异。

Conclusion: FlowRL通过流优化与强化学习目标的结合，实现了复杂策略类下的高效学习。

Abstract: We present \textbf{FlowRL}, a novel framework for online reinforcement
learning that integrates flow-based policy representation with
Wasserstein-2-regularized optimization. We argue that in addition to training
signals, enhancing the expressiveness of the policy class is crucial for the
performance gains in RL. Flow-based generative models offer such potential,
excelling at capturing complex, multimodal action distributions. However, their
direct application in online RL is challenging due to a fundamental objective
mismatch: standard flow training optimizes for static data imitation, while RL
requires value-based policy optimization through a dynamic buffer, leading to
difficult optimization landscapes. FlowRL first models policies via a
state-dependent velocity field, generating actions through deterministic ODE
integration from noise. We derive a constrained policy search objective that
jointly maximizes Q through the flow policy while bounding the Wasserstein-2
distance to a behavior-optimal policy implicitly derived from the replay
buffer. This formulation effectively aligns the flow optimization with the RL
objective, enabling efficient and value-aware policy learning despite the
complexity of the policy class. Empirical evaluations on DMControl and
Humanoidbench demonstrate that FlowRL achieves competitive performance in
online reinforcement learning benchmarks.

TL;DR: TrojanTO是一种针对轨迹优化（TO）模型的首次动作级后门攻击方法，通过交替训练和精确毒化实现高效且隐蔽的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击基于奖励操纵，对TO模型无效，且高维动作空间增加了动作操纵的复杂性。

Method: 采用交替训练增强触发器与目标动作的关联，通过轨迹过滤和批量毒化提升隐蔽性。

Result: TrojanTO在低攻击预算（0.3%轨迹）下成功植入后门，适用于多种任务和TO模型架构。

Conclusion: TrojanTO填补了TO模型后门攻击的研究空白，展示了其高效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Trajectory Optimization (TO) models have achieved
remarkable success in offline reinforcement learning. However, their
vulnerabilities against backdoor attacks are poorly understood. We find that
existing backdoor attacks in reinforcement learning are based on reward
manipulation, which are largely ineffective against the TO model due to its
inherent sequence modeling nature. Moreover, the complexities introduced by
high-dimensional action spaces further compound the challenge of action
manipulation. To address these gaps, we propose TrojanTO, the first
action-level backdoor attack against TO models. TrojanTO employs alternating
training to enhance the connection between triggers and target actions for
attack effectiveness. To improve attack stealth, it utilizes precise poisoning
via trajectory filtering for normal performance and batch poisoning for trigger
consistency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TrojanTO effectively
implants backdoor attacks across diverse tasks and attack objectives with a low
attack budget (0.3\% of trajectories). Furthermore, TrojanTO exhibits broad
applicability to DT, GDT, and DC, underscoring its scalability across diverse
TO model architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ENN的替代模型，用于解决贝叶斯优化（BO）在大规模观测数据下的计算瓶颈问题，并结合Pareto最优策略提出TuRBO-ENN方法，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化（BO）在处理大规模观测数据时，由于高斯过程（GP）的计算复杂度高（O(N^2)），成为性能瓶颈。因此，需要一种更高效的替代模型。

Method: 提出Epistemic Nearest Neighbors（ENN）替代模型，利用K近邻观测估计函数值和认知不确定性，具有O(N)查询时间。结合Pareto最优策略，提出TuRBO-ENN方法。

Result: TuRBO-ENN将生成提案的时间减少了一到两个数量级，并能扩展到数千个观测数据。

Conclusion: ENN和TuRBO-ENN为大规模贝叶斯优化问题提供了高效解决方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has traditionally solved black box problems where
evaluation is expensive and, therefore, design-evaluation pairs (i.e.,
observations) are few. Recently, there has been growing interest in applying BO
to problems where evaluation is cheaper and, thus, observations are more
plentiful. An impediment to scaling BO to many observations, $N$, is the
$O(N^3)$ scaling of a na{\"i}ve query of the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate.
Modern implementations reduce this to $O(N^2)$, but the GP remains a
bottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a surrogate that
estimates function values and epistemic uncertainty from $K$ nearest-neighbor
observations. ENN has $O(N)$ query time and omits hyperparameter fitting,
leaving uncertainty uncalibrated. To accommodate the lack of calibration, we
employ an acquisition method based on Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between
predicted value and uncertainty. Our proposed method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the
GP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson sampling acquisition method
with our Pareto-based alternative. We demonstrate numerically that TuRBO-ENN
can reduce the time to generate proposals by one to two orders of magnitude
compared to TuRBO and scales to thousands of observations.

TL;DR: PDCNet是一种深度学习框架，用于预测肽-药物偶联物（PDCs）的活性，通过多级特征融合框架优于传统机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统阐明PDCs的结构-活性关系（SARs）并准确预测其活性，以优化其设计。

Method: 构建基准PDCs数据集，开发PDCNet框架，通过多级特征融合学习肽、连接体和载荷的特征。

Result: PDCNet在测试集上表现优异（AUC 0.9213，F1 0.7656等），优于八种传统模型。

Conclusion: PDCNet为PDCs的设计和发现提供了新范式，结合基准数据集和先进模型，有望加速新疗法的开发。

Abstract: Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) represent a promising therapeutic avenue for
human diseases, particularly in cancer treatment. Systematic elucidation of
structure-activity relationships (SARs) and accurate prediction of the activity
of PDCs are critical for the rational design and optimization of these
conjugates. To this end, we carefully design and construct a benchmark PDCs
dataset compiled from literature-derived collections and PDCdb database, and
then develop PDCNet, the first unified deep learning framework for forecasting
the activity of PDCs. The architecture systematically captures the complex
factors underlying anticancer decisions of PDCs in real-word scenarios through
a multi-level feature fusion framework that collaboratively characterizes and
learns the features of peptides, linkers, and payloads. Leveraging a curated
PDCs benchmark dataset, comprehensive evaluation results show that PDCNet
demonstrates superior predictive capability, with the highest AUC, F1, MCC and
BA scores of 0.9213, 0.7656, 0.7071 and 0.8388 for the test set, outperforming
eight established traditional machine learning models. Multi-level validations,
including 5-fold cross-validation, threshold testing, ablation studies, model
interpretability analysis and external independent testing, further confirm the
superiority, robustness, and usability of the PDCNet architecture. We
anticipate that PDCNet represents a novel paradigm, incorporating both a
benchmark dataset and advanced models, which can accelerate the design and
discovery of new PDC-based therapeutic agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了差分隐私（DP）与在线学习在PAC列表学习中的关系，发现与多分类设置不同，有限k-Littlestone维度不足以保证DP k-列表可学习性，但仍是必要条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究差分隐私与在线学习在列表学习中的关系，填补现有理论在多分类与列表学习之间的差异。

Method: 通过理论证明和构造反例（如单调函数类），分析k-Littlestone维度和新引入的k-单调维度的作用。

Result: 发现有限k-Littlestone维度不足以保证DP列表学习，但k-单调维度是另一必要条件。两者关系与多分类不同。

Conclusion: 列表学习中DP与在线学习的等价性不成立，需进一步研究双维度有限性是否足以实现隐私学习。

Abstract: This work explores the connection between differential privacy (DP) and
online learning in the context of PAC list learning. In this setting, a
$k$-list learner outputs a list of $k$ potential predictions for an instance
$x$ and incurs a loss if the true label of $x$ is not included in the list. A
basic result in the multiclass PAC framework with a finite number of labels
states that private learnability is equivalent to online learnability [Alon,
Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019); Bun, Livni, and Moran (2020); Jung, Kim,
and Tewari (2020)]. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this equivalence does
not hold in the context of list learning. Specifically, we prove that, unlike
in the multiclass setting, a finite $k$-Littlestone dimensio--a variant of the
classical Littlestone dimension that characterizes online $k$-list
learnability--is not a sufficient condition for DP $k$-list learnability.
However, similar to the multiclass case, we prove that it remains a necessary
condition.
  To demonstrate where the equivalence breaks down, we provide an example
showing that the class of monotone functions with $k+1$ labels over
$\mathbb{N}$ is online $k$-list learnable, but not DP $k$-list learnable. This
leads us to introduce a new combinatorial dimension, the \emph{$k$-monotone
dimension}, which serves as a generalization of the threshold dimension. Unlike
the multiclass setting, where the Littlestone and threshold dimensions are
finite together, for $k>1$, the $k$-Littlestone and $k$-monotone dimensions do
not exhibit this relationship. We prove that a finite $k$-monotone dimension is
another necessary condition for DP $k$-list learnability, alongside finite
$k$-Littlestone dimension. Whether the finiteness of both dimensions implies
private $k$-list learnability remains an open question.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理效率成为部署瓶颈，现有方法存在误差高或训练成本高的问题。

Method: 提出MaskPro框架，通过学习先验分类分布生成(N:M)稀疏性，并引入损失残差移动平均跟踪器以稳定训练。

Result: 实验验证MaskPro在性能、内存效率和数据样本鲁棒性上的优越表现。

Conclusion: MaskPro为高效稀疏化提供了可行方案，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made inference
efficiency a primary bottleneck in the practical deployment. To address this,
semi-structured sparsity offers a promising solution by strategically retaining
$N$ elements out of every $M$ weights, thereby enabling hardware-friendly
acceleration and reduced memory. However, existing (N:M)-compatible approaches
typically fall into two categories: rule-based layerwise greedy search, which
suffers from considerable errors, and gradient-driven combinatorial learning,
which incurs prohibitive training costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose
a novel linear-space probabilistic framework named MaskPro, which aims to learn
a prior categorical distribution for every $M$ consecutive weights and
subsequently leverages this distribution to generate the (N:M)-sparsity
throughout an $N$-way sampling without replacement. Furthermore, to mitigate
the training instability induced by the high variance of policy gradients in
the super large combinatorial space, we propose a novel update method by
introducing a moving average tracker of loss residuals instead of vanilla loss.
Finally, we conduct comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments to validate the superior performance of MaskPro, as well as its
excellent scalability in memory efficiency and exceptional robustness to data
samples. Our code is available at https://github.com/woodenchild95/Maskpro.git.

Motivation: 传统k-means算法对异常值和数据不平衡敏感，导致中心点偏移和次优分区。

Method: K-Sil通过轮廓分数加权点，结合用户指定的轮廓聚合指标（宏/微平均或组合），并采用自适应加权方案和采样策略。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，K-Sil的轮廓分数显著优于k-means及其他加权变体。

Conclusion: K-Sil是一种高效且适应性强的聚类算法，适用于高质量、分离良好的聚类需求。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning task with numerous
applications across diverse fields. Popular algorithms such as k-means often
struggle with outliers or imbalances, leading to distorted centroids and
suboptimal partitions. We introduce K-Sil, a silhouette-guided refinement of
the k-means algorithm that weights points based on their silhouette scores,
prioritizing well-clustered instances while suppressing borderline or noisy
regions. The algorithm emphasizes user-specified silhouette aggregation
metrics: macro-, micro-averaged or a combination, through self-tuning weighting
schemes, supported by appropriate sampling strategies and scalable
approximations. These components ensure computational efficiency and
adaptability to diverse dataset geometries. Theoretical guarantees establish
centroid convergence, and empirical validation on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrates statistically significant improvements in silhouette
scores over k-means and two other instance-weighted k-means variants. These
results establish K-Sil as a principled alternative for applications demanding
high-quality, well-separated clusters.

Motivation: 研究softmax策略梯度方法的logit动态，以理解其更新幅度如何影响方法的稳定性和收敛性。

Result: 发现更新幅度由动作概率和策略碰撞概率决定，并揭示了自调节机制。

Conclusion: 研究为softmax策略梯度方法的稳定性和收敛性提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We analyzes the logit dynamics of softmax policy gradient methods. We derive
the exact formula for the L2 norm of the logit update vector: $$ \|\Delta
\mathbf{z}\|_2 \propto \sqrt{1-2P_c + C(P)} $$ This equation demonstrates that
update magnitudes are determined by the chosen action's probability ($P_c$) and
the policy's collision probability ($C(P)$), a measure of concentration
inversely related to entropy. Our analysis reveals an inherent self-regulation
mechanism where learning vigor is automatically modulated by policy confidence,
providing a foundational insight into the stability and convergence of these
methods.

Motivation: 现代AI系统的安全机制面临越狱攻击的威胁，且攻击可能在不同模型间转移，但目前缺乏识别转移条件的理论方法。

Method: 通过量化源模型的越狱强度和模型间上下文表示相似性，评估转移可能性；利用目标模型的良性响应蒸馏源模型以增强攻击转移性。

Result: 蒸馏后的源模型可作为目标模型的替代，生成更具转移性的攻击，表明越狱成功与模型上下文表示的固有缺陷相关。

Conclusion: 越狱攻击的成功不仅源于安全训练的泛化不足，更与模型上下文表示的根本缺陷有关。

Abstract: Jailbreaks pose an imminent threat to ensuring the safety of modern AI
systems by enabling users to disable safeguards and elicit unsafe information.
Sometimes, jailbreaks discovered for one model incidentally transfer to another
model, exposing a fundamental flaw in safeguarding. Unfortunately, there is no
principled approach to identify when jailbreaks will transfer from a source
model to a target model. In this work, we observe that transfer success from a
source model to a target model depends on quantifiable measures of both
jailbreak strength with respect to the source model and the contextual
representation similarity of the two models. Furthermore, we show
transferability can be increased by distilling from the target model into the
source model where the only target model responses used to train the source
model are those to benign prompts. We show that the distilled source model can
act as a surrogate for the target model, yielding more transferable attacks
against the target model. These results suggest that the success of jailbreaks
is not merely due to exploitation of safety training failing to generalize
out-of-distribution, but instead a consequence of a more fundamental flaw in
contextual representations computed by models.

Abstract: In this work, a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) based algorithm is
used for simulation of nonlinear 1D and 2D Burgers' type models. This scheme
relies on a neural network built to approximate the problem solution and use a
trial function that meets the initial data and boundary criteria. First of all,
a brief mathematical formulation of the problem and the structure of PINNs,
including the neural network architecture, loss construction, and training
methodology is described. Finally, the algorithm is demonstrated with five test
problems involving variations of the 1D coupled, 2D single and 2D coupled
Burgers' models. We compare the PINN-based solutions with exact results to
assess accuracy and convergence of the developed algorithm. The results
demonstrate that PINNs may faithfully replicate nonlinear PDE solutions and
offer competitive performance in terms of inaccuracy and flexibility. This work
demonstrates the potential of PINNs as a reliable approach to solving complex
time-dependent PDEs.

Conclusion: 通过类比局部搜索中的问题复杂性缩放，发现简单的梯度下降也能产生类似的趋势。

Abstract: Recent work on neural scaling laws demonstrates that model performance scales
predictably with compute budget, model size, and dataset size. In this work, we
develop scaling laws based on problem complexity. We analyze two fundamental
complexity measures: solution space size and representation space size. Using
the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study, we show that
combinatorial optimization promotes smooth cost trends, and therefore
meaningful scaling laws can be obtained even in the absence of an interpretable
loss. We then show that suboptimality grows predictably for fixed-size models
when scaling the number of TSP nodes or spatial dimensions, independent of
whether the model was trained with reinforcement learning or supervised
fine-tuning on a static dataset. We conclude with an analogy to problem
complexity scaling in local search, showing that a much simpler gradient
descent of the cost landscape produces similar trends.

Abstract: Risk stratification is a key tool in clinical decision-making, yet current
approaches often fail to translate sophisticated survival analysis into
actionable clinical criteria. We present a novel method for unsupervised
machine learning that directly optimizes for survival heterogeneity across
patient clusters through a differentiable adaptation of the multivariate
logrank statistic. Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our
approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network
architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient
groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and
demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer
types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and
computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients,
identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly
different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses
uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which
align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the
methods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable
advancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel
prognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable
results that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical
decision-making in oncology and beyond.

of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized
prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based
tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is
possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and
requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own
method, PatchInstruct, which enables LLMs to make precise and effective
predictions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across

To measure their effectiveness, various benchmarks have been developed that

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布式训练数据归因方法（d-TDA），以解决传统方法忽略训练随机性的问题，并展示了其实际应用和理论意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据归因算法未能充分考虑训练过程中的随机性（如初始化和批处理），导致相同数据集可能产生不同模型。

Method: 引入分布式训练数据归因（d-TDA），预测模型输出分布如何依赖于数据集，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: d-TDA能识别显著影响目标测量分布的训练样本，且发现影响函数（IFs）是其框架的自然极限。

Conclusion: d-TDA为数据归因提供了新视角，解释了IFs在深度学习中的有效性及其局限性。

Abstract: Randomness is an unavoidable part of training deep learning models, yet
something that traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to
rigorously account for. They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the
initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different
models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing
distributional training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to
predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon
the dataset. We demonstrate the practical significance of d-TDA in experiments,
e.g. by identifying training examples that drastically change the distribution
of some target measurement without necessarily changing the mean. Intriguingly,
we also find that influence functions (IFs), a popular but poorly-understood
data attribution tool, emerge naturally from our distributional framework as
the limit to unrolled differentiation; without requiring restrictive convexity
assumptions. This provides a new mathematical motivation for their efficacy in
deep learning, and helps to characterise their limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双层优化在机器学习中广泛应用（如元学习和超参数优化），但涉及敏感数据时隐私保护成为重要问题。论文旨在解决差分隐私下的双层优化问题。

Method: 针对凸目标函数，提出了基于指数机制和正则化指数机制的高效实现；针对非凸目标函数，开发了新的算法以找到近似驻点。

Result: 在凸情况下，风险界限几乎与单层差分隐私优化的最优速率一致；在非凸情况下，算法达到了当前最优的收敛速率。

Conclusion: 论文为差分隐私下的双层优化提供了理论和算法支持，特别是在高维内层问题中表现出色。

Abstract: Bilevel optimization, in which one optimization problem is nested inside
another, underlies many machine learning applications with a hierarchical
structure -- such as meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization. Such
applications often involve sensitive training data, raising pressing concerns
about individual privacy. Motivated by this, we study differentially private
bilevel optimization. We first focus on settings where the outer-level
objective is \textit{convex}, and provide novel upper and lower bounds on the
excess risk for both pure and approximate differential privacy, covering both
empirical and population-level loss. These bounds are nearly tight and
essentially match the optimal rates for standard single-level differentially
private ERM and stochastic convex optimization (SCO), up to additional terms
that capture the intrinsic complexity of the nested bilevel structure. The
bounds are achieved in polynomial time via efficient implementations of the
exponential and regularized exponential mechanisms. A key technical
contribution is a new method and analysis of log-concave sampling under inexact
function evaluations, which may be of independent interest. In the
\textit{non-convex} setting, we develop novel algorithms with state-of-the-art
rates for privately finding approximate stationary points. Notably, our bounds
do not depend on the dimension of the inner problem.

Conclusion: Ab-RoBERTa为抗体研究提供了高效工具，填补了公开模型的空白。

Abstract: With the growing prominence of antibody-based therapeutics, antibody
engineering has gained increasing attention as a critical area of research and
development. Recent progress in transformer-based protein large language models
(LLMs) has demonstrated promising applications in protein sequence design and
structural prediction. Moreover, the availability of large-scale antibody
datasets such as the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database has opened new
avenues for the development of LLMs specialized for processing antibody
sequences. Among these, RoBERTa has demonstrated improved performance relative
to BERT, while maintaining a smaller parameter count (125M) compared to the
BERT-based protein model, ProtBERT (420M). This reduced model size enables more
efficient deployment in antibody-related applications. However, despite the
numerous advantages of the RoBERTa architecture, antibody-specific foundational
models built upon it have remained inaccessible to the research community. In
this study, we introduce Ab-RoBERTa, a RoBERTa-based antibody-specific LLM,
which is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/mogam-ai/Ab-RoBERTa. This
resource is intended to support a wide range of antibody-related research
applications including paratope prediction or humanness assessment.

individual models, we construct an interrelated architecture, namely Geometric
Embedding Alignment via cuRvature matching in transfer learning (GEAR), which
ensures comprehensive geometric representation across datapoints. This
framework enables the effective aggregation of knowledge from diverse sources,
thereby improving performance on target tasks. We evaluate our model on 23

Abstract: Modern deep learning models are highly overparameterized, resulting in large
sets of parameter configurations that yield the same outputs. A significant
portion of this redundancy is explained by symmetries in the parameter
space--transformations that leave the network function unchanged. These
symmetries shape the loss landscape and constrain learning dynamics, offering a
new lens for understanding optimization, generalization, and model complexity
that complements existing theory of deep learning. This survey provides an
overview of parameter space symmetry. We summarize existing literature, uncover
connections between symmetry and learning theory, and identify gaps and
opportunities in this emerging field.

Conclusion: 结合内容感知的时序建模框架能显著提升序列推荐的性能，C-TLSAN为这一方向提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sequential recommender systems aim to model users' evolving preferences by
capturing patterns in their historical interactions. Recent advances in this
area have leveraged deep neural networks and attention mechanisms to
effectively represent sequential behaviors and time-sensitive interests. In
this work, we propose C-TLSAN (Content-Enhanced Time-Aware Long- and Short-Term
Attention Network), an extension of the TLSAN architecture that jointly models
long- and short-term user preferences while incorporating semantic content
associated with items, such as product descriptions.
  C-TLSAN enriches the recommendation pipeline by embedding textual content
linked to users' historical interactions directly into both long-term and
short-term attention layers. This allows the model to learn from both
behavioral patterns and rich item content, enhancing user and item
representations across temporal dimensions. By fusing sequential signals with
textual semantics, our approach improves the expressiveness and personalization
capacity of recommendation systems.
  We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Amazon datasets, benchmarking
C-TLSAN against state-of-the-art baselines, including recent sequential
recommenders based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent interaction
history and predictions in text form. Empirical results demonstrate that
C-TLSAN consistently outperforms strong baselines in next-item prediction
tasks. Notably, it improves AUC by 1.66%, Recall@10 by 93.99%, and Precision@10
by 94.80% on average over the best-performing baseline (TLSAN) across 10 Amazon
product categories. These results highlight the value of integrating
content-aware enhancements into temporal modeling frameworks for sequential
recommendation. Our code is available at https://github.com/booml247/cTLSAN.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to
comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level
performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally
constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting
to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on
previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous
approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of
generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative
models, including large language models, multimodal large language models,
vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from
the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these
approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and
replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and
motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different
generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core
backbones, offering deeper insights into the field. The project page of this

Method: 通过实现在线测试任务，分析不同假设类（如VC维度、Eluder维度、星数）对存储需求的影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在机器学习遗忘任务中，存储需求与假设类复杂性之间的紧密联系，为未来算法设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study the memory complexity of machine unlearning algorithms that provide
strong data deletion guarantees to the users. Formally, consider an algorithm
for a particular learning task that initially receives a training dataset.
Then, after learning, it receives data deletion requests from a subset of users
(of arbitrary size), and the goal of unlearning is to perform the task as if
the learner never received the data of deleted users. In this paper, we ask how
many bits of storage are needed to be able to delete certain training samples
at a later time. We focus on the task of realizability testing, where the goal
is to check whether the remaining training samples are realizable within a
given hypothesis class \(\mathcal{H}\).
  Toward that end, we first provide a negative result showing that the VC
dimension is not a characterization of the space complexity of unlearning. In
particular, we provide a hypothesis class with constant VC dimension (and
Littlestone dimension), but for which any unlearning algorithm for
realizability testing needs to store \(\Omega(n)\)-bits, where \(n\) denotes
the size of the initial training dataset. In fact, we provide a stronger
separation by showing that for any hypothesis class \(\mathcal{H}\), the amount
of information that the learner needs to store, so as to perform unlearning
later, is lower bounded by the \textit{eluder dimension} of \(\mathcal{H}\), a
combinatorial notion always larger than the VC dimension. We complement the
lower bound with an upper bound in terms of the star number of the underlying
hypothesis class, albeit in a stronger ticketed-memory model proposed by Ghazi
et al. (2023). Since the star number for a hypothesis class is never larger
than its Eluder dimension, our work highlights a fundamental separation between
central and ticketed memory models for machine unlearning.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a
noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. Reformulating this
reverse process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential
equation (ODE) enables efficient sampling using high-order solvers, often
requiring only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ steps. Since the score function is typically
approximated by a neural network, analyzing the interaction between its
regularity, approximation error, and numerical integration error is key to
understanding the overall sampling accuracy. In this work, we continue our
analysis of the convergence properties of the deterministic sampling methods
derived from probability flow ODEs [25], focusing on $p$-th order (exponential)
Runge-Kutta schemes for any integer $p \geq 1$. Under the assumption that the
first and second derivatives of the approximate score function are bounded, we
develop $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes and demonstrate that the
total variation distance between the target distribution and the generated data
distribution can be bounded above by \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}}
+d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$
denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data
dimension and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum step size used in the solver.
We numerically verify the regularity assumption on benchmark datasets,
confirming that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score
function remain bounded in practice. Our theoretical guarantees hold for
general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules.

Motivation: 多元时间序列预测中普遍存在的缺失值问题会显著降低预测准确性，传统方法的两阶段范式（先插补后预测）存在误差累积和目标不一致的问题。

Method: CoIFNet框架结合了跨时间步融合（CTF）和跨变量融合（CVF）模块，通过统一处理缺失值和预测任务来捕捉鲁棒的时序依赖关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoIFNet在缺失率为0.6时比现有方法提升了24.40%（点缺失）和23.81%（块缺失），同时内存和时间效率分别提高了4.3倍和2.1倍。

Conclusion: CoIFNet通过统一插补和预测任务，显著提升了多元时间序列预测的鲁棒性和效率，为缺失值问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a critical task with broad
applications in domains such as meteorology, transportation, and economics.
Nevertheless, pervasive missing values caused by sensor failures or human
errors significantly degrade forecasting accuracy. Prior efforts usually employ
an impute-then-forecast paradigm, leading to suboptimal predictions due to
error accumulation and misaligned objectives between the two stages. To address
this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network
(CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve
robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the
observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them
sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion
(CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing
values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning
objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values. Through
extensive experiments on challenging MSTF benchmarks, we demonstrate the
effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed approach across
diverse missing-data scenarios, e.g., CoIFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art
method by $\underline{\textbf{24.40}}$% ($\underline{\textbf{23.81}}$%) at a
point (block) missing rate of 0.6, while improving memory and time efficiency
by $\underline{\boldsymbol{4.3\times}}$ and
$\underline{\boldsymbol{2.1\times}}$, respectively.

Result: 实验证明EFGNN在准确性和可信度上表现优异，且对攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EFGNN有效提升了图神经网络的预测可信度和准确性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel in graph representation learning by
integrating graph structure and node features. Existing GNNs, unfortunately,
fail to account for the uncertainty of class probabilities that vary with the
depth of the model, leading to unreliable and risky predictions in real-world
scenarios. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Evidence Fusing
Graph Neural Network (EFGNN for short) to achieve trustworthy prediction,
enhance node classification accuracy, and make explicit the risk of wrong
predictions. In particular, we integrate the evidence theory with multi-hop
propagation-based GNN architecture to quantify the prediction uncertainty of
each node with the consideration of multiple receptive fields. Moreover, a
parameter-free cumulative belief fusion (CBF) mechanism is developed to
leverage the changes in prediction uncertainty and fuse the evidence to improve
the trustworthiness of the final prediction. To effectively optimize the EFGNN
model, we carefully design a joint learning objective composed of evidence
cross-entropy, dissonance coefficient, and false confident penalty. The
experimental results on various datasets and theoretical analyses demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of accuracy and
trustworthiness, as well as its robustness to potential attacks. The source

Result: 实验表明DyGC在仅0.5%原图规模下保留96.2%性能，训练速度提升1846倍。

Conclusion: DyGC有效解决动态图数据效率问题，为高效DGNN训练提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent research on deep graph learning has shifted from static to dynamic
graphs, motivated by the evolving behaviors observed in complex real-world
systems. However, the temporal extension in dynamic graphs poses significant
data efficiency challenges, including increased data volume, high
spatiotemporal redundancy, and reliance on costly dynamic graph neural networks
(DGNNs). To alleviate the concerns, we pioneer the study of dynamic graph
condensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic
graphs for data-efficient DGNN training. Accordingly, we propose DyGC, a novel
framework that condenses the real dynamic graph into a compact version while
faithfully preserving the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics.
Specifically, to endow synthetic graphs with realistic evolving structures, a
novel spiking structure generation mechanism is introduced. It draws on the
dynamic behavior of spiking neurons to model temporally-aware connectivity in
dynamic graphs. Given the tightly coupled spatiotemporal dependencies, DyGC
proposes a tailored distribution matching approach that first constructs a
semantically rich state evolving field for dynamic graphs, and then performs
fine-grained spatiotemporal state alignment to guide the optimization of the
condensed graph. Experiments across multiple dynamic graph datasets and
representative DGNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of DyGC.
Notably, our method retains up to 96.2% DGNN performance with only 0.5% of the
original graph size, and achieves up to 1846 times training speedup.

Conclusion: FAME能有效平衡多模态数据的公平性和预测性能。

Abstract: Electronic Health Record (EHR) data encompass diverse modalities -- text,
images, and medical codes -- that are vital for clinical decision-making. To
process these complex data, multimodal AI (MAI) has emerged as a powerful
approach for fusing such information. However, most existing MAI models
optimize for better prediction performance, potentially reinforcing biases
across patient subgroups. Although bias-reduction techniques for multimodal
models have been proposed, the individual strengths of each modality and their
interplay in both reducing bias and optimizing performance remain
underexplored. In this work, we introduce FAME (Fairness-Aware Multimodal
Embeddings), a framework that explicitly weights each modality according to its
fairness contribution. FAME optimizes both performance and fairness by
incorporating a combined loss function. We leverage the Error Distribution
Disparity Index (EDDI) to measure fairness across subgroups and propose a
sign-agnostic aggregation method to balance fairness across subgroups, ensuring
equitable model outcomes. We evaluate FAME with BEHRT and BioClinicalBERT,
combining structured and unstructured EHR data, and demonstrate its
effectiveness in terms of performance and fairness compared with other
baselines across multiple EHR prediction tasks.

*Yanfang Hou,Carlos Fernández-Loría*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 诚实估计在因果森林中可能损害个体效应估计的准确性，因为它在偏差和方差之间存在权衡，取决于信噪比（SNR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨诚实估计在因果森林中对个体效应估计的影响，揭示其潜在的偏差-方差权衡。

Method: 分析诚实估计在因果森林中的作用，通过信噪比（SNR）评估其效果。

Result: 诚实估计在低SNR时有益，但在高SNR时会损害估计准确性。

Conclusion: 诚实估计应基于样本外性能选择，而非默认使用。

Abstract: Causal forests are increasingly used to personalize decisions based on
estimated treatment effects. A distinctive modeling choice in this method is
honest estimation: using separate data for splitting and for estimating effects
within leaves. This practice is the default in most implementations and is
widely seen as desirable for causal inference. But we show that honesty can
hurt the accuracy of individual-level effect estimates. The reason is a classic
bias-variance trade-off: honesty reduces variance by preventing overfitting,
but increases bias by limiting the model's ability to discover and exploit
meaningful heterogeneity in treatment effects. This trade-off depends on the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): honesty helps when effect heterogeneity is hard to
detect (low SNR), but hurts when the signal is strong (high SNR). In essence,
honesty acts as a form of regularization, and like any regularization choice,
it should be guided by out-of-sample performance, not adopted by default.

Method: 提出GPDP算法，利用高斯过程回归引导扩散模型生成动作，优化Q函数，并通过核方法提升策略在分布变化下的探索效率。

Result: 在Walker2d基准测试中，GPDP在分布变化条件下优于现有算法，目标函数提升67.74%至123.18%。

Conclusion: GPDP算法有效提升了强化学习在分布变化下的适应性和探索效率。

Abstract: One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its
limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by
uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural
networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after
prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper
proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that
integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent
the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize
learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the
kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under
distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new
behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d
benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under
distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement
in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under
normal conditions.

Result: 在芝加哥犯罪数据集上达到88%的分类准确率，并生成可解释的热点图。

Conclusion: 图学习方法在预测警务和空间犯罪学中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Crime hotspot prediction is critical for ensuring urban safety and effective
law enforcement, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatial
dependencies inherent in criminal activity. The previous approaches tended to
use classical algorithms such as the KDE and SVM to model data distributions
and decision boundaries. The methods often fail to capture these spatial
relationships, treating crime events as independent and ignoring geographical
interactions. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which explicitly model spatial dependencies by
representing crime data as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent discrete
geographic grid cells and edges capture proximity relationships. Using the
Chicago Crime Dataset, we engineer spatial features and train a multi-layer GCN
model to classify crime types and predict high-risk zones. Our approach
achieves 88% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods. Additionally, the model generates interpretable heat maps of crime
hotspots, demonstrating the practical utility of graph-based learning for
predictive policing and spatial criminology.

Abstract: PDE-Constrained Optimization (PDECO) problems can be accelerated
significantly by employing gradient-based methods with surrogate models like
neural operators compared to traditional numerical solvers. However, this
approach faces two key challenges: (1) **Data inefficiency**: Lack of efficient
data sampling and effective training for neural operators, particularly for
optimization purpose. (2) **Instability**: High risk of optimization derailment
due to inaccurate neural operator predictions and gradients. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework: (1) **Optimization-oriented
training**: we leverage data from full steps of traditional optimization
algorithms and employ a specialized training method for neural operators. (2)
**Enhanced derivative learning**: We introduce a *Virtual-Fourier* layer to
enhance derivative learning within the neural operator, a crucial aspect for
gradient-based optimization. (3) **Hybrid optimization**: We implement a hybrid
approach that integrates neural operators with numerical solvers, providing
robust regularization for the optimization process. Our extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in accurately learning
operators and their derivatives. Furthermore, our hybrid optimization approach
exhibits robust convergence.

Result: 算法实现了对Pareto最优和高效Pareto最优臂的次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 新度量方法和算法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，平衡了多目标冲突下的性能。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems are widely applied to online optimization
tasks that require balancing exploration and exploitation. In practical
scenarios, these tasks often involve multiple conflicting objectives, giving
rise to multi-objective multi-armed bandits (MO-MAB). Existing MO-MAB
approaches predominantly rely on the Pareto regret metric introduced in
\cite{drugan2013designing}. However, this metric has notable limitations,
particularly in accounting for all Pareto-optimal arms simultaneously. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel and comprehensive regret metric
that ensures balanced performance across conflicting objectives. Additionally,
we introduce the concept of \textit{Efficient Pareto-Optimal} arms, which are
specifically designed for online optimization. Based on our new metric, we
develop a two-phase MO-MAB algorithm that achieves sublinear regret for both
Pareto-optimal and efficient Pareto-optimal arms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ADMM算法在联邦学习中虽然广泛应用，但其核心结构长期未变，无法有效处理异构性问题。

Method: 利用贝叶斯对偶性，通过变分贝叶斯重构问题，推导出新的ADMM扩展形式，支持不同后验分布（如高斯、牛顿式等）。

Result: 在异构联邦学习中，新方法比现有基线提升了高达7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究为改进原始-对偶方法开辟了一条新的贝叶斯路径。

Abstract: ADMM is a popular method for federated deep learning which originated in the
1970s and, even though many new variants of it have been proposed since then,
its core algorithmic structure has remained unchanged. Here, we take a major
departure from the old structure and present a fundamentally new way to derive
and extend federated ADMM. We propose to use a structure called Bayesian
Duality which exploits a duality of the posterior distributions obtained by
solving a variational-Bayesian reformulation of the original problem. We show
that this naturally recovers the original ADMM when isotropic Gaussian
posteriors are used, and yields non-trivial extensions for other posterior
forms. For instance, full-covariance Gaussians lead to Newton-like variants of
ADMM, while diagonal covariances result in a cheap Adam-like variant. This is
especially useful to handle heterogeneity in federated deep learning, giving up
to 7% accuracy improvements over recent baselines. Our work opens a new
Bayesian path to improve primal-dual methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集所有权验证方法假设验证过程是可信的，但在实际中可能因扰动而失效，因此需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 基于共形预测，引入主概率（PP）和水印鲁棒性（WR）两个统计指标，证明PP与WR之间存在可证明的下界，用于验证所有权。

Result: 实验证明CertDW方法有效且能抵抗潜在的自适应攻击。

Conclusion: CertDW为数据集所有权提供了一种认证的、可靠的验证方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) rely heavily on high-quality open-source datasets
(e.g., ImageNet) for their success, making dataset ownership verification (DOV)
crucial for protecting public dataset copyrights. In this paper, we find
existing DOV methods (implicitly) assume that the verification process is
faithful, where the suspicious model will directly verify ownership by using
the verification samples as input and returning their results. However, this
assumption may not necessarily hold in practice and their performance may
degrade sharply when subjected to intentional or unintentional perturbations.
To address this limitation, we propose the first certified dataset watermark
(i.e., CertDW) and CertDW-based certified dataset ownership verification method
that ensures reliable verification even under malicious attacks, under certain
conditions (e.g., constrained pixel-level perturbation). Specifically, inspired
by conformal prediction, we introduce two statistical measures, including
principal probability (PP) and watermark robustness (WR), to assess model
prediction stability on benign and watermarked samples under noise
perturbations. We prove there exists a provable lower bound between PP and WR,
enabling ownership verification when a suspicious model's WR value
significantly exceeds the PP values of multiple benign models trained on
watermark-free datasets. If the number of PP values smaller than WR exceeds a
threshold, the suspicious model is regarded as having been trained on the
protected dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the
effectiveness of our CertDW method and its resistance to potential adaptive
attacks. Our codes are at

Motivation: 解决在指数级候选集合中选择最优石板并最大化累积奖励的问题，同时降低每轮计算成本。

Method: 提出Slate-GLM-OFU和Slate-GLM-TS算法，通过局部规划和全局学习实现高效计算和低遗憾。

Result: 理论证明Slate-GLM-OFU遗憾为O(√T)，实验显示算法在多种设置下优于基线，且应用于语言模型示例选择任务表现优异。

Conclusion: 算法在理论和实践中均表现优异，适用于实际场景如语言模型任务。

Abstract: We study the Logistic Contextual Slate Bandit problem, where, at each round,
an agent selects a slate of $N$ items from an exponentially large set (of size
$2^{\Omega(N)}$) of candidate slates provided by the environment. A single
binary reward, determined by a logistic model, is observed for the chosen
slate. Our objective is to develop algorithms that maximize cumulative reward
over $T$ rounds while maintaining low per-round computational costs. We propose
two algorithms, Slate-GLM-OFU and Slate-GLM-TS, that accomplish this goal.
These algorithms achieve $N^{O(1)}$ per-round time complexity via local
planning (independent slot selections), and low regret through global learning
(joint parameter estimation). We provide theoretical and empirical evidence
supporting these claims. Under a well-studied diversity assumption, we prove
that Slate-GLM-OFU incurs only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of synthetic settings demonstrate that our
algorithms consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines, achieving both
the lowest regret and the fastest runtime. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm
to select in-context examples in prompts of Language Models for solving binary
classification tasks such as sentiment analysis. Our approach achieves
competitive test accuracy, making it a viable alternative in practical
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分子表示学习主要关注原子级去噪，难以捕捉全局分子结构，而图级性质预测任务（如能量估计）需要更全面的表示。

Method: GeoRecon通过图级重建任务，训练模型生成能够准确重建分子几何的图表示，从而学习全局结构特征。

Result: 在不依赖额外监督或外部数据的情况下，GeoRecon在多个分子基准测试（如QM9、MD17）上优于原子级基线方法。

Conclusion: 图级重建任务有助于学习更全面且几何感知的分子嵌入，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm has driven significant advances
across domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision, with
representative pretraining paradigms such as masked language modeling and
next-token prediction. However, in molecular representation learning, the task
design remains largely limited to node-level denoising, which is effective at
modeling local atomic environments, yet maybe insufficient for capturing the
global molecular structure required by graph-level property prediction tasks,
such as energy estimation and molecular regression. In this work, we present
GeoRecon, a novel graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from
individual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon introduces a
graph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to
generate an informative graph representation capable of accurately guiding
reconstruction of the molecular geometry. This encourages the model to learn
coherent, global structural features rather than isolated atomic details.
Without relying on additional supervision or external data, GeoRecon
outperforms node-centric baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks (e.g., QM9,
MD17), demonstrating the benefit of incorporating graph-level reconstruction
for learning more holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩适配方法未考虑数据上下文，导致微调性能不佳和预训练知识遗忘严重。

Method: 提出上下文导向奇异值分解（SVD），通过目标任务的输入激活协方差矩阵初始化适配器，并开发了动态协方差选择和动态秩分配策略（CorDA++）。

Result: CorDA++在知识保留模式（KPM）下优于LoRA，在指令预览模式（IPM）下收敛速度更快（如4.5倍于QLoRA），并在多种场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: CorDA++通过任务感知的适配器设计，显著提升了性能并减少了知识遗忘，已集成至Hugging Face的PEFT库。

Abstract: Conventional low-rank adaptation methods build adapters without considering
data context, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning performance and severe
forgetting of inherent world knowledge. In this paper, we propose
context-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that
initializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop
context-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance
matrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the
target task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its
corresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is
compacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our
method enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)
and instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between
freezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or
adapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by
deriving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal
components, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank
allocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each
layer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank
allocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a
significant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning
performance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained
knowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM,
our method exhibits faster convergence, \emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA,
and improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong
baseline methods. Our method has been integrated into the PEFT library
developed by Hugging Face.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is critical for drug
discovery. While recent deep learning approaches have demonstrated promising
results, they often rely solely on structural features, overlooking valuable
biochemical knowledge associated with binding affinity. To address this
limitation, we propose KEPLA, a novel deep learning framework that explicitly
integrates prior knowledge from Gene Ontology and ligand properties of proteins
and ligands to enhance prediction performance. KEPLA takes protein sequences
and ligand molecular graphs as input and optimizes two complementary
objectives: (1) aligning global representations with knowledge graph relations
to capture domain-specific biochemical insights, and (2) leveraging cross
attention between local representations to construct fine-grained joint
embeddings for prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets across both
in-domain and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that KEPLA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, interpretability analyses
based on knowledge graph relations and cross attention maps provide valuable
insights into the underlying predictive mechanisms.

sustained interaction often leads to user fatigue, reducing efficiency and
engagement. This study proposes a fatigue-aware adaptive interface system for
wearable devices that leverages deep learning to analyze physiological data

mitigate cognitive load. The system employs multimodal learning to process
physiological and contextual inputs and reinforcement learning to optimize
interface features like text size, notification frequency, and visual contrast.
Experimental results show a 18% reduction in cognitive load and a 22%
improvement in user satisfaction compared to static interfaces, particularly
for users engaged in prolonged tasks. This approach enhances accessibility and
usability in wearable computing environments.

Method: 微调推理模型禁用CoT，评估时重新启用CoT，并观察其行为。还研究带有后门触发的模型行为。

Conclusion: 推理步骤既能揭示也能隐藏错位意图，无法阻止模型错位行为。研究发布了三个新数据集和评估工具。

Abstract: Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow
domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a
phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends
from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on
malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable
CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly
misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for
tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these
misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick
the user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five
sleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors
that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.
  Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad
behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes
broad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find
that reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers,
demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these
behaviors but is unreliable.
  In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned
intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We
release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent
misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation
suite.

Result: 发现训练初期的微小扰动会导致显著的分歧，但这种效应随训练时间迅速减弱。

Conclusion: 研究结果为神经网络训练的稳定性提供了见解，对微调、模型合并和模型集成的多样性具有实际意义。

Abstract: Neural network training is inherently sensitive to initialization and the
randomness induced by stochastic gradient descent. However, it is unclear to
what extent such effects lead to meaningfully different networks, either in
terms of the models' weights or the underlying functions that were learned. In
this work, we show that during the initial "chaotic" phase of training, even
extremely small perturbations reliably causes otherwise identical training
trajectories to diverge-an effect that diminishes rapidly over training time.
We quantify this divergence through (i) $L^2$ distance between parameters, (ii)
the loss barrier when interpolating between networks, (iii) $L^2$ and barrier
between parameters after permutation alignment, and (iv) representational
similarity between intermediate activations; revealing how perturbations across
different hyperparameter or fine-tuning settings drive training trajectories
toward distinct loss minima. Our findings provide insights into neural network
training stability, with practical implications for fine-tuning, model merging,
and diversity of model ensembles.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种快速知识蒸馏方法，结合预存储压缩机制和信道自适应模块，显著提升语义通信的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模人工智能模型（LAI）在实时通信中面临高计算需求和信道适应性问题，标准知识蒸馏方法难以满足需求。

Abstract: Recent studies have focused on leveraging large-scale artificial intelligence
(LAI) models to improve semantic representation and compression capabilities.
However, the substantial computational demands of LAI models pose significant
challenges for real-time communication scenarios. To address this, this paper
proposes utilizing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to extract and
condense knowledge from LAI models, effectively reducing model complexity and
computation latency. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of LAI models leads
to prolonged inference times during distillation, while their lack of channel
awareness compromises the distillation performance. These limitations make
standard KD methods unsuitable for task-oriented semantic communication
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a fast distillation method
featuring a pre-stored compression mechanism that eliminates the need for
repetitive inference, significantly improving efficiency. Furthermore, a
channel adaptive module is incorporated to dynamically adjust the transmitted
semantic information based on varying channel conditions, enhancing
communication reliability and adaptability. In addition, an information
bottleneck-based loss function is derived to guide the fast distillation
process. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperform
baselines in term of task accuracy, model size, computation latency, and
training data requirements.

Motivation: 解决资源约束下奖励和成本分布随时间对抗性变化的在线决策问题，传统方法无法实现次线性遗憾。

Result: 算法在支出计划平衡时性能提升，鲁棒变体能应对最坏情况，并分析了基准偏离计划时的遗憾。

Conclusion: 支出计划指导的算法有效解决资源约束问题，性能依赖于预算分配的平衡性。

Abstract: We study online decision making problems under resource constraints, where
both reward and cost functions are drawn from distributions that may change
adversarially over time. We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online
resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action
selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are
observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is
well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when
reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this
challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending
plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design
general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to
baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our
algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution
of the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our
methods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly
imbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing
against benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan.

Conclusion: 组合子任务课程能有效提升Transformer在上下文学习中的性能，并影响其计算策略。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) research often considers learning a function
in-context through a uniform sample of input-output pairs. Here, we investigate
how presenting a compositional subtask curriculum in context may alter the
computations a transformer learns. We design a compositional algorithmic task
based on the modular exponential-a double exponential task composed of two
single exponential subtasks and train transformer models to learn the task
in-context. We compare (a) models trained using an in-context curriculum
consisting of single exponential subtasks and, (b) models trained directly on
the double exponential task without such a curriculum. We show that models
trained with a subtask curriculum can perform zero-shot inference on unseen
compositional tasks and are more robust given the same context length. We study
how the task and subtasks are represented across the two training regimes. We
find that the models employ diverse strategies modulated by the specific
curriculum design.

Result: 生成的决策规则能够清晰解释分类或评分结果，并为新单元提供评估建议。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了复合指标的解释性和透明度，适用于多种评估场景。

Abstract: Composite indicators are widely used to score or classify units evaluated on
multiple criteria. Their construction involves aggregating criteria
evaluations, a common practice in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). In
MCDA, various methods have been proposed to address key aspects of multiple
criteria evaluations, such as the measurement scales of the criteria, the
degree of acceptable compensation between them, and their potential
interactions. However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is
essential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well
as the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing
explainable and interpretable composite indicators using "if..., then..."
decision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of
composite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical
scores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal
qualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into
quantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in
the form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is
constructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units
results from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision
rules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the
Dominance-based Rough Set Approach. The resulting decision rules relate the
class assignment or unit's score to threshold conditions on values of selected
indicators in an intelligible way, clarifying the underlying rationale.
Moreover, they serve to recommend composite indicator assessment for new units
of interest.

Motivation: 现有学习率配置方法局限于特定训练场景且需大量超参数调优，AdaLRS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AdaLRS通过优化损失下降速度在线搜索最优学习率，仅依赖训练损失动态，计算开销低。

Result: 实验表明AdaLRS能高效调整学习率至最优附近，提升模型性能，并具有跨场景鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaLRS是一种高效、通用的自适应学习率搜索方法，适用于多种基础模型预训练场景。

Abstract: Learning rate is widely regarded as crucial for effective foundation model
pretraining. Recent research explores and demonstrates the transferability of
learning rate configurations across varying model and dataset sizes, etc.
Nevertheless, these approaches are constrained to specific training scenarios
and typically necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on proxy models. In
this work, we propose \textbf{AdaLRS}, a plug-in-and-play adaptive learning
rate search algorithm that conducts online optimal learning rate search via
optimizing loss descent velocities. We provide experiment results to show that
the optimization of training loss and loss descent velocity in foundation model
pretraining are both convex and share the same optimal learning rate. Relying
solely on training loss dynamics, AdaLRS involves few extra computations to
guide the search process, and its convergence is guaranteed via theoretical
analysis. Experiments on both LLM and VLM pretraining show that AdaLRS adjusts
suboptimal learning rates to the neighborhood of optimum with marked efficiency
and effectiveness, with model performance improved accordingly. We also show
the robust generalizability of AdaLRS across varying training scenarios, such
as different model sizes, training paradigms, and base learning rate scheduler
choices.

### [380] [SeqPE: Transformer with Sequential Position Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13277)
*Huyang Li,Yahui Liu,Hongyu Sun,Deng Cai,Leyang Cui,Wei Bi,Peilin Zhao,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SeqPE是一种统一且完全可学习的位置编码框架，通过将位置索引表示为符号序列并使用轻量级编码器学习嵌入，解决了传统位置编码在适应性和扩展性上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的位置编码方法（如ALiBi和RoPE）在适应新模态时需要大量修改，且固定大小的查找表限制了序列长度外推能力。SeqPE旨在提供一种更灵活、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: SeqPE将位置索引表示为符号序列，并使用轻量级顺序编码器学习嵌入。通过对比目标和知识蒸馏损失正则化嵌入空间，提升外推性能。

Result: 在语言建模、长上下文问答和2D图像分类任务中，SeqPE在困惑度、精确匹配和准确率上优于基线，尤其在长度外推时表现突出。

Conclusion: SeqPE不仅提升了性能，还能无缝扩展到多维输入，无需手动调整架构，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Since self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by
design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial
understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable
position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained
sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this
limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities,
underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this
work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding
framework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic
sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their
embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we
introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns
embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a
knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position
embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing
extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context
question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only
surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and
accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables
seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual
architectural redesign. We release our code, data, and checkpoints at
https://github.com/ghrua/seqpe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了将vine copula模型更好地集成到现代机器学习流程中，需要一种抽象化和高效的计算框架。

Conclusion: 通过将vine copula模型转化为计算图，该研究将经典依赖建模与现代深度学习工具链结合，推动了先进copula方法在机器学习中的应用。

Abstract: Vine copulas are sophisticated models for multivariate distributions and are
increasingly used in machine learning. To facilitate their integration into
modern ML pipelines, we introduce the vine computational graph, a DAG that
abstracts the multilevel vine structure and associated computations. On this
foundation, we devise new algorithms for conditional sampling, efficient
sampling-order scheduling, and constructing vine structures for customized
conditioning variables. We implement these ideas in torchvinecopulib, a
GPU-accelerated Python library built upon PyTorch, delivering improved
scalability for fitting, sampling, and density evaluation. Our experiments
illustrate how gradient flowing through the vine can improve Vine Copula
Autoencoders and that incorporating vines for uncertainty quantification in
deep learning can outperform MC-dropout, deep ensembles, and Bayesian Neural
Networks in sharpness, calibration, and runtime. By recasting vine copula
models as computational graphs, our work connects classical dependence modeling
with modern deep-learning toolchains and facilitates the integration of
state-of-the-art copula methods in modern machine learning pipelines.

Conclusion: 生物启发的归纳偏置显著提升了模型的可解释性、性能和可控性。

Abstract: Human intelligence emerges from the interaction of specialized brain
networks, each dedicated to distinct cognitive functions such as language
processing, logical reasoning, social understanding, and memory retrieval.
Inspired by this biological observation, we introduce the Mixture of Cognitive
Reasoners (MiCRo) architecture and training paradigm: a modular
transformer-based language model with a training curriculum that encourages the
emergence of functional specialization among different modules. Inspired by
studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer
model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive
brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of
the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and
functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs
performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms
comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks.
And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively
emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical
reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our
findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human
cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance,
and controllability.

Conclusion: LapDDPM为条件性单细胞RNA测序数据生成设定了新标准，为下游生物应用提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is
challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological
variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique
characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks.
We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model
for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates
graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a
novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our
contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs)
to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we
develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and
generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique
spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness
against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq
datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity
and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets
a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust
tool for various downstream biological applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的探索方法SEE，适用于密集、稀疏和探索不利的奖励设置，无需额外调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有探索方法在不良奖励设置下需要额外调参的问题。

Method: 通过最大化TD误差作为独立目标，引入三个设计选择以解决不稳定性和冲突。

Result: SEE与Soft-Actor Critic结合，在多种任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: SEE是一种无需调参的通用探索方法，适用于多种奖励设置。

Abstract: Numerous heuristics and advanced approaches have been proposed for
exploration in different settings for deep reinforcement learning. Noise-based
exploration generally fares well with dense-shaped rewards and bonus-based
exploration with sparse rewards. However, these methods usually require
additional tuning to deal with undesirable reward settings by adjusting
hyperparameters and noise distributions. Rewards that actively discourage
exploration, i.e., with an action cost and no other dense signal to follow, can
pose a major challenge. We propose a novel exploration method, Stable
Error-seeking Exploration (SEE), that is robust across dense, sparse, and
exploration-adverse reward settings. To this endeavor, we revisit the idea of
maximizing the TD-error as a separate objective. Our method introduces three
design choices to mitigate instability caused by far-off-policy learning, the
conflict of interest of maximizing the cumulative TD-error in an episodic
setting, and the non-stationary nature of TD-errors. SEE can be combined with
off-policy algorithms without modifying the optimization pipeline of the
original objective. In our experimental analysis, we show that a Soft-Actor
Critic agent with the addition of SEE performs robustly across three diverse
reward settings in a variety of tasks without hyperparameter adjustments.

Abstract: We propose two new methods based/inspired by machine learning for tabular
data and distance-free localization to enhance the covariance estimations in an
ensemble data assimilation. The main goal is to enhance the data assimilation
results by mitigating loss of variance due to sampling errors. We also analyze
the suitability of several machine learning models and the balance between
accuracy and computational cost of the covariance estimations. We introduce two
distance-free localization techniques leveraging machine learning methods
specifically tailored for tabular data. The methods are integrated into the
Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework. The
results show that the proposed localizations improve covariance accuracy and
enhance data assimilation and uncertainty quantification results. We observe
reduced variance loss for the input variables using the proposed methods.
Furthermore, we compare several machine learning models, assessing their
suitability for the problem in terms of computational cost, and quality of the
covariance estimation and data match. The influence of ensemble size is also
investigated, providing insights into balancing accuracy and computational
efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that certain machine learning models are
more suitable for this problem. This study introduces two novel methods that
mitigate variance loss for model parameters in ensemble-based data
assimilation, offering practical solutions that are easy to implement and do
not require any additional numerical simulation or hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Intra-cortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) present a promising solution
to restoring and decoding brain activity lost due to injury. However, patients
with such neuroprosthetics suffer from permanent skull openings resulting from
the devices' bulky wiring. This drives the development of wireless iBMIs, which
demand low power consumption and small device footprint. Most recently, spiking
neural networks (SNNs) have been researched as potential candidates for
low-power neural decoding. In this work, we present the next step of utilizing
SNNs for such tasks, building on the recently published results of the 2024
Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding Challenge for Motor Control of non-Human
Primates. We optimize our model architecture to exceed the existing state of
the art on the Primate Reaching dataset while maintaining similar resource
demand through various compression techniques. We further focus on implementing
a realtime-capable version of the model and discuss the implications of this
architecture. With this, we advance one step towards latency-free decoding of
cortical spike trains using neuromorphic technology, ultimately improving the
lives of millions of paralyzed patients.

Conclusion: CALM通过局部与全局结合，实现了高效且鲁棒的模型合并。

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate the strengths of multiple fine-tuned models
into a unified model while preserving task-specific capabilities. Existing
methods, represented by task arithmetic, are typically classified into global-
and local-aware methods. However, global-aware methods inevitably cause
parameter interference, while local-aware methods struggle to maintain the
effectiveness of task-specific details in the merged model. To address these
limitations, we propose a Consensus-Aware Localized Merging (CALM) method which
incorporates localized information aligned with global task consensus, ensuring
its effectiveness post-merging. CALM consists of three key components: (1)
class-balanced entropy minimization sampling, providing a more flexible and
reliable way to leverage unsupervised data; (2) an efficient-aware framework,
selecting a small set of tasks for sequential merging with high scalability;
(3) a consensus-aware mask optimization, aligning localized binary masks with
global task consensus and merging them conflict-free. Experiments demonstrate
the superiority and robustness of our CALM, significantly outperforming
existing methods and achieving performance close to traditional MTL.

Conclusion: 空间嵌入框架不仅减少了参数数量，还提供了网络结构的直观可视化，同时引入生物启发的归纳偏置。

Abstract: The high computational complexity and increasing parameter counts of deep
neural networks pose significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or real-time systems.
To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient neural architecture where
neurons are embedded in Euclidean space. During training, their positions are
optimized and synaptic weights are determined as the inverse of the spatial
distance between connected neurons. These distance-dependent wiring rules
replace traditional learnable weight matrices and significantly reduce the
number of parameters while introducing a biologically inspired inductive bias:
connection strength decreases with spatial distance, reflecting the brain's
embedding in three-dimensional space where connections tend to minimize wiring
length. We validate this approach for both multi-layer perceptrons and spiking
neural networks. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that these
spatially embedded neural networks achieve a performance competitive with
conventional architectures on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, the models
maintain performance even at pruning rates exceeding 80% sparsity,
outperforming traditional networks with the same number of parameters under
similar conditions. Finally, the spatial embedding framework offers an
intuitive visualization of the network structure.

Abstract: Advancements in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors enable
sophisticated Predictive Maintenance (PM) with high temporal resolution. For
cost-efficient solutions, vibration-based condition monitoring is especially of
interest. However, analyzing high-resolution vibration data via traditional

This paper investigates a recurrent SNN for simultaneous regression (flow,

regression outputs achieve Mean Relative Percentage Errors below 1% for flow
and pump speed, approaching industrial sensor standards, although pressure
prediction requires further refinement. Energy estimates indicate significant
power savings, with the Loihi consumption (0.0032 J/inf) being up to 3 orders
of magnitude less compared to the estimated x86 CPU (11.3 J/inf) and ARM CPU
(1.18 J/inf) execution. Our findings underscore the potential of SNNs for
multi-task PM directly on resource-constrained edge devices, enabling scalable
and energy-efficient industrial monitoring solutions.

Motivation: 评估深度卷积神经网络在图像重建任务中的性能极限，并与量子物理中的标准量子极限和海森堡极限进行比较。

Method: 使用U-Net模型对自然物体图像进行训练，并计算量子Cramér-Rao界限以确定参数估计的最小方差。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络可以学习成为物理定律允许的最优估计器，在经典照明条件下实现最高精度的参数估计和图像重建。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been shown to achieve exceptional performance for
computer vision tasks like image recognition, segmentation, and reconstruction
or denoising. Here, we evaluate the ultimate performance limits of deep
convolutional neural network models for image reconstruction, by comparing them
against the standard quantum limit set by shot-noise and the Heisenberg limit
on precision. We train U-Net models on images of natural objects illuminated
with coherent states of light, and find that the average mean-squared error of
the reconstructions can surpass the standard quantum limit, and in some cases
reaches the Heisenberg limit. Further, we train models on well-parameterized
images for which we can calculate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound to determine
the minimum possible measurable variance of an estimated parameter for a given
probe state. We find the mean-squared error of the model predictions reaches
these bounds calculated for the parameters, across a variety of parameterized
images. These results suggest that deep convolutional neural networks can learn
to become the optimal estimators allowed by the laws of physics, performing
parameter estimation and image reconstruction at the ultimate possible limits
of precision for the case of classical illumination of the object.

Result: 球形网格方法在基准测试和实际训练中速度提升30%，理论性能与实际表现存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 需针对具体应用进行基准测试，简化后的GTP实现更高效且不影响渐近运行时。

Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have demonstrated success across a wide
range of 3D modelling tasks. A fundamental operation in these networks is the
tensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner
to create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor
product, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this
operation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor
product (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a
careful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In
particular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the
same operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of
expressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to
characterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original
implementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical
grid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster
on our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by
30\%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various
tensor product operations. We find that the theoretical runtime guarantees can
differ wildly from empirical performance, demonstrating the need for careful
application-specific benchmarking. Code is available at

Abstract: Seismic acoustic impedance plays a crucial role in lithological
identification and subsurface structure interpretation. However, due to the
inherently ill-posed nature of the inversion problem, directly estimating
impedance from post-stack seismic data remains highly challenging. Recently,
diffusion models have shown great potential in addressing such inverse problems
due to their strong prior learning and generative capabilities. Nevertheless,
most existing methods operate in the pixel domain and require multiple
iterations, limiting their applicability to field data. To alleviate these
limitations, we propose a novel seismic acoustic impedance inversion framework
based on a conditional latent generative diffusion model, where the inversion
process is made in latent space. To avoid introducing additional training
overhead when embedding conditional inputs, we design a lightweight
wavelet-based module into the framework to project seismic data and reuse an
encoder trained on impedance to embed low-frequency impedance into the latent
space. Furthermore, we propose a model-driven sampling strategy during the
inversion process of this framework to enhance accuracy and reduce the number
of required diffusion steps. Numerical experiments on a synthetic model
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high inversion accuracy and
strong generalization capability within only a few diffusion steps. Moreover,
application to field data reveals enhanced geological detail and higher
consistency with well-log measurements, validating the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: 本文通过扩展学习增强聚类到一般度量空间并放宽限制，提升了方法的理论深度和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning. Previous research
has focused on learning-augmented $k$-means in Euclidean metrics, limiting its
applicability to complex data representations. In this paper, we generalize
learning-augmented $k$-clustering to operate on general metrics, enabling its
application to graph-structured and non-Euclidean domains. Our framework also
relaxes restrictive cluster size constraints, providing greater flexibility for
datasets with imbalanced or unknown cluster distributions. Furthermore, we
extend the hardness of query complexity to general metrics: under the
Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), we show that any polynomial-time algorithm
must perform approximately $\Omega(k / \alpha)$ queries to achieve a $(1 +
\alpha)$-approximation. These contributions strengthen both the theoretical
foundations and practical applicability of learning-augmented clustering,
bridging gaps between traditional methods and real-world challenges.

Conclusion: 本文为PINNs提供了一个数学严谨且实用的稳定性框架，阐明了其在稳健训练中的关键因素。

Abstract: We develop a rigorous stability framework for Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) grounded in variational analysis, operator coercivity, and
explicit perturbation theory. PINNs approximate solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing residual-based losses over sampled
collocation points. We derive deterministic stability bounds that quantify how
bounded perturbations in the network output propagate through both residual and
supervised loss components. Probabilistic stability is established via
McDiarmid's inequality, yielding non-asymptotic concentration bounds that link
sampling variability to empirical loss fluctuations under minimal assumptions.
Generalization from Sobolev-norm training loss to uniform approximation is
analyzed using coercivity and Sobolev embeddings, leading to pointwise error
control. The theoretical results apply to both scalar and vector-valued PDEs
and cover composite loss formulations. Numerical experiments validate the
perturbation sensitivity, sample complexity estimates, and Sobolev-to-uniform
generalization bounds. This work provides a mathematically grounded and
practically applicable stability framework for PINNs, clarifying the role of
operator structure, sampling design, and functional regularity in robust
training.

Conclusion: ByITFL和LoByITFL为联邦学习提供了隐私和安全的解决方案，分别适用于不同场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) shows great promise in large-scale machine learning
but introduces new privacy and security challenges. We propose ByITFL and
LoByITFL, two novel FL schemes that enhance resilience against Byzantine users
while keeping the users' data private from eavesdroppers. To ensure privacy and
Byzantine resilience, our schemes build on having a small representative
dataset available to the federator and crafting a discriminator function
allowing the mitigation of corrupt users' contributions. ByITFL employs
Lagrange coded computing and re-randomization, making it the first
Byzantine-resilient FL scheme with perfect Information-Theoretic (IT) privacy,
though at the cost of a significant communication overhead. LoByITFL, on the
other hand, achieves Byzantine resilience and IT privacy at a significantly
reduced communication cost, but requires a Trusted Third Party, used only in a
one-time initialization phase before training. We provide theoretical
guarantees on privacy and Byzantine resilience, along with convergence
guarantees and experimental results validating our findings.

<details>

Motivation: 传统JSSP方法在现实生产环境中因复杂约束（如运输物流、机器故障等）效果不佳，缺乏通用框架支持RL代理的训练和评估。

Method: 提出模块化框架，扩展经典JSSP，纳入现实约束（如缓冲管理、随机处理条件），支持多目标优化和灵活配置。

Result: 开发了开源工具JobShopLab，提供标准化接口，兼容多种RL方法，支持动态条件下的调度方法比较。

Conclusion: JobShopLab为研究和工业应用提供了灵活、可定制的解决方案，填补了现实约束下RL调度框架的空白。

Abstract: The classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) focuses on optimizing
makespan under deterministic constraints. Real-world production environments
introduce additional complexities that cause traditional scheduling approaches
to be less effective. Reinforcement learning (RL) holds potential in addressing
these challenges, as it allows agents to learn adaptive scheduling strategies.
However, there is a lack of a comprehensive, general-purpose frameworks for
effectively training and evaluating RL agents under real-world constraints. To
address this gap, we propose a modular framework that extends classical JSSP
formulations by incorporating key \mbox{real-world} constraints inherent to the
shopfloor, including transport logistics, buffer management, machine
breakdowns, setup times, and stochastic processing conditions, while also
supporting multi-objective optimization. The framework is a customizable
solution that offers flexibility in defining problem instances and configuring
simulation parameters, enabling adaptation to diverse production scenarios. A
standardized interface ensures compatibility with various RL approaches,
providing a robust environment for training RL agents and facilitating the
standardized comparison of different scheduling methods under dynamic and
uncertain conditions. We release JobShopLab as an open-source tool for both
research and industrial applications, accessible at:

Motivation: 离散扩散模型在文本生成中具有优势，但无法灵活填充文本长度和位置，限制了其应用。

Method: DDOT采用样本级最优传输耦合，联合去噪标记值和位置，动态调整填充段的位置和长度。

Result: 在文本填充基准测试中，DDOT优于基线模型，性能与非自回归模型相当，并提高了训练效率和灵活性。

Conclusion: DDOT是首个解决离散扩散模型灵活填充问题的模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer
advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and
flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical
limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform
flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to
ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete
\textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling),
the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly
denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level
Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token
ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled
segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is
orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with
various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling
benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms
naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with
state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements
in training efficiency and flexibility.

Result: 实验验证了方法的理论有效性，并展示了其在生成AI模型安全风险评估中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM安全风险评估提供了高效且可校准的解决方案。

Abstract: We develop a framework to quantify the time-to-unsafe-sampling - the number
of large language model (LLM) generations required to trigger an unsafe (e.g.,
toxic) response. Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe
responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only
once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating
time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a
prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic
sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an
unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved
in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly
challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of
survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound
(LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent
advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive,
per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The
objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to
reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to
improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling
budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our
theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for
safety risk assessment in generative AI models.

Result: 实验表明，即使有足够的示例演示，ICL的性能在提示复杂度增加时仍受限。

Conclusion: ICL虽有一定优势，但其有效性在复杂任务中受限，理论分析也支持这一发现。

Abstract: Generating rational and generally accurate responses to tasks, often
accompanied by example demonstrations, highlights Large Language Model's
(LLM's) remarkable In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities without requiring
updates to the model's parameter space. Despite having an ongoing exploration
focused on the inference from a document-level concept, its behavior in
learning well-defined functions or relations in context needs a careful
investigation. In this article, we present the performance of ICL on partially
ordered relation by introducing the notion of inductively increasing complexity
in prompts. In most cases, the saturated performance of the chosen metric
indicates that while ICL offers some benefits, its effectiveness remains
constrained as we increase the complexity in the prompts even in presence of
sufficient demonstrative examples. The behavior is evident from our empirical
findings and has further been theoretically justified in term of its implicit
optimization process. The code is available

Abstract: Synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in medical research by

This study presents a beta-Variational Autoencoder Graph Convolutional Neural
Network framework for generating synthetic Abdominal Aorta Aneurysms (AAA).
Using a small real-world dataset, our approach extracts key anatomical features
and captures complex statistical relationships within a compact disentangled
latent space. To address data limitations, low-impact data augmentation based
on Procrustes analysis was employed, preserving anatomical integrity. The
generation strategies, both deterministic and stochastic, manage to enhance
data diversity while ensuring realism. Compared to PCA-based approaches, our
model performs more robustly on unseen data by capturing complex, nonlinear
anatomical variations. This enables more comprehensive clinical and statistical
analyses than the original dataset alone. The resulting synthetic AAA dataset
preserves patient privacy while providing a scalable foundation for medical

Abstract: Many engineering and scientific fields have recently become interested in
modeling terms in partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks.
The resulting neural-network PDE model, being a function of the neural network
parameters, can be calibrated to available data by optimizing over the PDE
using gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated in a computationally
efficient manner by solving an adjoint PDE. These neural-network PDE models
have emerged as an important research area in scientific machine learning. In
this paper, we study the convergence of the adjoint gradient descent
optimization method for training neural-network PDE models in the limit where
both the number of hidden units and the training time tend to infinity.
Specifically, for a general class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs with a neural
network embedded in the source term, we prove convergence of the trained
neural-network PDE solution to the target data (i.e., a global minimizer). The
global convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not
encountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to
(1) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network
kernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks
a spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (2) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE
system, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem, even in the
infinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neual network training
cases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit).
The theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical
studies.

should a LLM interact with external services, such as \api and data. However,
as MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces
new safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are
not controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party
MCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic
incentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In
this position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay
close attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop
new techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our
position, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \framework, a
controlled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2)
We then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks
in MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial.
(3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered
agent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the
following research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP
safety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP
safe ecosystem construction. We hope this position paper can raise the
awareness of the research community in MCP safety and encourage more
researchers to join this important research direction. Our code is available at

Motivation: 在离线深度强化学习中，回放缓冲区中的无效数据会污染学习过程并浪费资源。作者希望通过避免沉没成本谬误（即无效回合的持续）来优化学习效率。

Method: 提出了LEAST机制，利用Q值和梯度统计来智能判断何时提前终止无效回合。

Result: 在MuJoCo和DeepMind Control Suite基准测试中，LEAST显著提高了多种强化学习算法的学习效率。

Conclusion: LEAST通过提前终止无效回合，有效提升了深度强化学习的样本效率和优化效果。

Abstract: Off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) typically leverages replay
buffers for reusing past experiences during learning. This can help improve
sample efficiency when the collected data is informative and aligned with the
learning objectives; when that is not the case, it can have the effect of
"polluting" the replay buffer with data which can exacerbate optimization
challenges in addition to wasting environment interactions due to wasteful
sampling. We argue that sampling these uninformative and wasteful transitions
can be avoided by addressing the sunk cost fallacy, which, in the context of
deep RL, is the tendency towards continuing an episode until termination. To
address this, we propose learn to stop (LEAST), a lightweight mechanism that
enables strategic early episode termination based on Q-value and gradient
statistics, which helps agents recognize when to terminate unproductive
episodes early. We demonstrate that our method improves learning efficiency on
a variety of RL algorithms, evaluated on both the MuJoCo and DeepMind Control
Suite benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理定律的深度学习框架Gravityformer，用于预测人类活动强度，解决了现有方法忽略物理约束和过平滑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ST-GNNs）忽略了空间交互的物理约束和过平滑现象，限制了预测性能。

Method: 通过引入万有引力定律约束空间交互，设计了自适应重力模型，并结合时空图卷积变换器结构。

Result: 在六个大规模数据集上验证了方法的优越性，且注意力矩阵可解释。

Conclusion: 该工作为时空预测学习提供了物理定律与深度学习结合的新思路。

Abstract: Human activity intensity prediction is a crucial to many location-based
services. Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic
spatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including
spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints
of spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial
correlation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a
physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed
Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to
integrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating
constraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two
spatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the
likelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial
interactions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the
learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon
in transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be
explicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel
spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for
achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic
experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the
quantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art
benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be
disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws. This work provides a
novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for
spatiotemporal predictive learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合学习器（H-learner），通过结合直接和间接正则化的优势，动态调整策略以优化条件平均处理效应（CATE）的估计效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（直接和间接元学习器）在不同场景下表现不一，缺乏一种灵活适应数据特性的统一框架。

Method: H-learner通过学习中间函数，近似CATE而无需精确拟合潜在结果（PO），动态调整正则化策略。

Result: 实验表明，H-learner在偏差-方差权衡上表现优异，始终位于帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: H-learner有效结合了直接和间接方法的优势，提供了一种更灵活的CATE估计方案。

Abstract: Estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) from observational
data involves modeling decisions that differ from supervised learning,
particularly concerning how to regularize model complexity. Previous approaches
can be grouped into two primary "meta-learner" paradigms that impose distinct
inductive biases. Indirect meta-learners first fit and regularize separate
potential outcome (PO) models and then estimate CATE by taking their
difference, whereas direct meta-learners construct and directly regularize
estimators for the CATE function itself. Neither approach consistently
outperforms the other across all scenarios: indirect learners perform well when
the PO functions are simple, while direct learners outperform when the CATE is
simpler than individual PO functions. In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid
Learner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between
the direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand. The
H-learner achieves this by learning intermediate functions whose difference
closely approximates the CATE without necessarily requiring accurate individual
approximations of the POs themselves. We demonstrate empirically that
intentionally allowing suboptimal fits to the POs improves the bias-variance
tradeoff in estimating CATE. Experiments conducted on semi-synthetic and
real-world benchmark datasets illustrate that the H-learner consistently
operates at the Pareto frontier, effectively combining the strengths of both
direct and indirect meta-learners.

Motivation: 探究Transformer在算法任务训练中突然学习现象的机制，特别是在浅层模型中。

Method: 分析浅层Transformer的训练动态，关注输出重复性、隐藏状态崩溃及注意力配置的学习过程。

Result: 平台期内模型输出重复性强，隐藏状态崩溃；优化注意力配置是突破瓶颈的关键。大型语言模型（如Pythia和OLMo）早期预训练中也存在类似现象。

Conclusion: 突然学习现象与注意力配置的缓慢学习密切相关，干预注意力可显著改变平台期时长和重复性/崩溃程度。

Abstract: Training Transformers on algorithmic tasks frequently demonstrates an
intriguing abrupt learning phenomenon: an extended performance plateau followed
by a sudden, sharp improvement. This work investigates the underlying
mechanisms for such dynamics, primarily in shallow Transformers. We reveal that
during the plateau, the model often develops an interpretable partial solution
while simultaneously exhibiting a strong repetition bias in their outputs. This
output degeneracy is accompanied by internal representation collapse, where
hidden states across different tokens become nearly parallel. We further
identify the slow learning of optimal attention maps as a key bottleneck.
Hidden progress in attention configuration during the plateau precedes the
eventual rapid convergence, and directly intervening on attention significantly
alters plateau duration and the severity of repetition bias and
representational collapse. We validate that these identified
phenomena-repetition bias and representation collapse-are not artifacts of toy
setups but also manifest in the early pre-training stage of large language
models like Pythia and OLMo.

Result: 在Atari游戏和StreetFighter II环境中显著优于Rainbow-DQN基线，且宏动作相似性可迁移到相关环境。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解动作空间几何相似性如何改进信用分配和探索提供了重要一步。

Abstract: One proposed mechanism to improve exploration in reinforcement learning is
through the use of macro-actions. Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the
naive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather
the opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful
macros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively
environment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different
perspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between
reducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size
of the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action
as independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and
making typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we
propose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between
actions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by
reducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving
exploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned
jointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy
looking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment.
Our results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all
environments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is
transferable to related environments. We believe this work is a small but
important step towards understanding how the similarity-imposed geometry on the
action space can be exploited to improve credit assignment and exploration,
therefore making learning more effective.

Motivation: 现有单轨迹方法（如DRO）需要近似价值函数，导致高离策略方差、策略与价值学习耦合等问题。RPO旨在通过数据驱动的分区方法直接优化策略。

Method: RPO通过分区方法对观测奖励进行归一化，直接对策略进行监督学习，无需辅助模型或联合优化。

Result: 实验表明，RPO在标量反馈语言建模任务中优于DRO和KTO。

Conclusion: RPO是一种简单、有效且理论支持的单轨迹策略优化方法。

Abstract: Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize
policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where
scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly
practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down
signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In
contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which
are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory
approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical
performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires
approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high
off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of
absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning
Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing
the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards
using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a
straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary
models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on
the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO
on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder
models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory
baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings
confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for
single-trajectory policy optimization.

Conclusion: 奖励驱动的强化学习是提升时间序列多模态大语言模型时间理解能力的可扩展且有前景的路径。

Abstract: Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous
semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster,
a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to
perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized
time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured
output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is
optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence,
prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using
a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish
a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at
the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in
time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across
six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series
models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain,
respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it
also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware
explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that
reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating
temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.

Result: SAM在遗忘任务中表现优于SGD，并能增强其他遗忘方法。Sharp MinMax进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: SAM在机器遗忘中具有潜力，Sharp MinMax方法为更严格的样本特定遗忘提供了新思路。

Abstract: We characterize the effectiveness of Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) under
machine unlearning scheme, where unlearning forget signals interferes with
learning retain signals. While previous work prove that SAM improves
generalization with noise memorization prevention, we show that SAM abandons
such denoising property when fitting the forget set, leading to various test
error bounds depending on signal strength. We further characterize the signal
surplus of SAM in the order of signal strength, which enables learning from
less retain signals to maintain model performance and putting more weight on
unlearning the forget set. Empirical studies show that SAM outperforms SGD with
relaxed requirement for retain signals and can enhance various unlearning
methods either as pretrain or unlearn algorithm. Observing that overfitting can
benefit more stringent sample-specific unlearning, we propose Sharp MinMax,
which splits the model into two to learn retain signals with SAM and unlearn
forget signals with sharpness maximization, achieving best performance.
Extensive experiments show that SAM enhances unlearning across varying
difficulties measured by data memorization, yielding decreased feature
entanglement between retain and forget sets, stronger resistance to membership
inference attacks, and a flatter loss landscape.

Conclusion: CLAMP成功结合物理、神经科学和机器学习的见解，为表示学习提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been
widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal
responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures
known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved
by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem.
We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a
self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold
packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential
energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in
the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each
class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single
image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized
by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable
dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces
geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the
standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only
a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with
state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are
effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the
potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine
learning.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架在压缩、子图发现和模型修正方面表现出色，为LLM的高效和安全部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI
applications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges
for deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments. Recent works in
eXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that
interpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing
components irrelevant to inference. In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise
Relevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs.
While LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend
it to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially
reduce model size with minimal performance loss. Our method is especially
effective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' --
which can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification).
Building on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively
removing circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). All
in all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase
its effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for
compression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models,
highlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/erfanhatefi/SparC3.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) using video-inpainting diffusion transformer models. Unlike existing
methods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse
problems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks
under a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast
PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward
prediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states
from initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based
architecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer
missing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video
diffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning,
while enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling.
Extensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model
offers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and
problem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 解决传统神经架构搜索方法在边缘设备上搜索时间长、资源消耗高的问题，实现硬件/软件协同设计的高效自动化。

Conclusion: MARCO为边缘AI部署提供了一种高效、准确的神经架构搜索方法，显著提升了硬件/软件协同设计的效率。

Abstract: This paper introduces MARCO (Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning with
Conformal Optimization), a novel hardware-aware framework for efficient neural
architecture search (NAS) targeting resource-constrained edge devices. By
significantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict
hardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and
CAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its
unique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal
Prediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for
deploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet
approaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task
into a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The
HCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer
bit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal
within a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key
innovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides
statistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune
unpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial
training or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the
search space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high
probability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared
to an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%).
Furthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency. Validation on a MAX78000
evaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with
simulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%.

Motivation: 目前关于WR对欧洲天气影响的研究多集中于线性方法，而地面气候变量（如温度和降水）的估计仍未被充分探索。论文旨在填补这一空白，利用AI工具提升季节性预测能力。

Method: 开发了一种非线性AI模型，利用WR指数描述欧洲-大西洋大气环流状态，并重建欧洲地表温度和降水异常。模型评估了不同WR数量对重建效果的影响，并分析了WR指数误差对结果的影响。

Conclusion: 基于WR的异常重建结合AI工具，为次季节和季节性预测提供了有前景的新途径。

Abstract: We present a non-linear AI-model designed to reconstruct monthly mean
anomalies of the European temperature and precipitation based on the
Euro-Atlantic Weather regimes (WR) indices. WR represent recurrent,
quasi-stationary, and persistent states of the atmospheric circulation that
exert considerable influence over the European weather, therefore offering an
opportunity for sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting. While much research has
focused on studying the correlation and impacts of the WR on European weather,
the estimation of ground-level climate variables, such as temperature and
precipitation, from Euro-Atlantic WR remains largely unexplored and is
currently limited to linear methods. The presented AI model can capture and
introduce complex non-linearities in the relation between the WR indices,
describing the state of the Euro-Atlantic atmospheric circulation and the
corresponding surface temperature and precipitation anomalies in Europe. We
discuss the AI-model performance in reconstructing the monthly mean two-meter
temperature and total precipitation anomalies in the European winter and
summer, also varying the number of WR used to describe the monthly atmospheric
circulation. We assess the impact of errors on the WR indices in the
reconstruction and show that a mean absolute relative error below 80% yields
improved seasonal reconstruction compared to the ECMWF operational seasonal
forecast system, SEAS5. As a demonstration of practical applicability, we
evaluate the model using WR indices predicted by SEAS5, finding slightly better
or comparable skill relative to the SEAS5 forecast itself. Our findings
demonstrate that WR-based anomaly reconstruction, powered by AI tools, offers a
promising pathway for sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasting.

Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language
Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs).
Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token,
parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based
generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation,
fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception.
These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models.
Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as
a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance
comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x
acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven
by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs
and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and
foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing
domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete
diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and
dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM
and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs,
formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative
models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and
summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and
biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research
and deployment.

### [419] [Diagnosing and Improving Diffusion Models by Estimating the Optimal Loss Value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13763)
*Yixian Xu,Shengjie Luo,Liwei Wang,Di He,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种估计扩散模型最优损失值的方法，用于诊断和改进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的损失值无法直接反映数据拟合质量，因为其最优值通常未知，导致难以区分模型容量不足与最优损失较高的问题。

Method: 通过统一扩散模型的形式，推导出最优损失的闭式解，并开发了有效的估计器，包括可扩展到大数据的随机变体。

Result: 利用最优损失工具，改进了主流扩散模型的训练质量诊断方法，并开发了更高效的训练计划。此外，发现减去最优损失后，训练损失更符合幂律。

Conclusion: 估计最优损失为扩散模型的诊断和改进提供了新工具，同时为研究扩散模型的缩放定律提供了更合理的设置。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.
Despite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of
absolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero
but unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient
model capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss
value for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the
optimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models,
and develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant
scalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this
tool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of
mainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training
schedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B
parameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting
the optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled
setting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代理模型（ABMs）无法捕捉人类行为的复杂性，而LLMs提供了新的可能性，但面临扩展挑战。

Method: Light Society通过结构化代理和环境状态转换，结合LLM驱动的模拟操作和事件队列，实现模块化设计。

Result: 大规模信任游戏和意见传播仿真（达十亿代理）验证了其高保真度和效率，并揭示了更大规模仿真带来更稳定和现实的行为。

Conclusion: Light Society为研究复杂社会行为提供了高效且高保真的工具，揭示了规模对行为稳定性的影响。

Abstract: Understanding how complex societal behaviors emerge from individual cognition
and interactions requires both high-fidelity modeling of human behavior and
large-scale simulations. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) have been
employed to study these dynamics for decades, but are constrained by simplified
agent behaviors that fail to capture human complexity. Recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities by enabling agents to exhibit
sophisticated social behaviors that go beyond rule-based logic, yet face
significant scaling challenges. Here we present Light Society, an agent-based
simulation framework that advances both fronts, efficiently modeling human-like
societies at planetary scale powered by LLMs. Light Society formalizes social
processes as structured transitions of agent and environment states, governed
by a set of LLM-powered simulation operations, and executed through an event
queue. This modular design supports both independent and joint component
optimization, supporting efficient simulation of societies with over one
billion agents. Large-scale simulations of trust games and opinion
propagation--spanning up to one billion agents--demonstrate Light Society's
high fidelity and efficiency in modeling social trust and information
diffusion, while revealing scaling laws whereby larger simulations yield more
stable and realistic emergent behaviors.

Abstract: Virtual environments are essential to AI agent research. Existing
environments for LLM agent research typically focus on either physical task
solving or social simulation, with the former oversimplifying agent
individuality and social dynamics, and the latter lacking physical grounding of
social behaviors. We introduce IndoorWorld, a heterogeneous multi-agent
environment that tightly integrates physical and social dynamics. By
introducing novel challenges for LLM-driven agents in orchestrating social
dynamics to influence physical environments and anchoring social interactions
within world states, IndoorWorld opens up possibilities of LLM-based building
occupant simulation for architectural design. We demonstrate the potential with
a series of experiments within an office setting to examine the impact of
multi-agent collaboration, resource competition, and spatial layout on agent
behavior.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信任的多智能体强化学习框架（Trust-MARL），用于解决异构交通环境中高速公路匝道合并的协作问题，显著提升了安全性、效率和舒适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类驾驶行为的不可预测性在复杂交通环境中（如高速公路匝道合并）常导致交通流中断和系统性能下降，需要一种方法实现CAV与HV的安全高效协作。

Method: Trust-MARL框架结合宏观层面的群体协调和微观层面的动态信任机制，通过信任触发的博弈论决策模块调整CAV的合作策略。

Result: 实验表明，Trust-MARL在不同CAV渗透率和交通密度下显著提升了安全性、效率、舒适性和适应性。

Conclusion: Trust-MARL为异构交通环境中的协作问题提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems require connected and automated vehicles
(CAVs) to conduct safe and efficient cooperation with human-driven vehicles
(HVs) in complex real-world traffic environments. However, the inherent
unpredictability of human behaviour, especially at bottlenecks such as highway
on-ramp merging areas, often disrupts traffic flow and compromises system
performance. To address the challenge of cooperative on-ramp merging in
heterogeneous traffic environments, this study proposes a trust-based
multi-agent reinforcement learning (Trust-MARL) framework. At the macro level,
Trust-MARL enhances global traffic efficiency by leveraging inter-agent trust
to improve bottleneck throughput and mitigate traffic shockwave through
emergent group-level coordination. At the micro level, a dynamic trust
mechanism is designed to enable CAVs to adjust their cooperative strategies in
response to real-time behaviors and historical interactions with both HVs and
other CAVs. Furthermore, a trust-triggered game-theoretic decision-making
module is integrated to guide each CAV in adapting its cooperation factor and
executing context-aware lane-changing decisions under safety, comfort, and
efficiency constraints. An extensive set of ablation studies and comparative
experiments validates the effectiveness of the proposed Trust-MARL approach,
demonstrating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, comfort, and
adaptability across varying CAV penetration rates and traffic densities.

Abstract: Optimizing urban freight logistics is critical for developing sustainable,
low-carbon cities. Traditional methods often rely on manual coordination of
simulation tools, optimization solvers, and expert-driven workflows, limiting
their efficiency and scalability. This paper presents an agentic system
architecture that leverages the model context protocol (MCP) to orchestrate
multi-agent collaboration among scientific tools for autonomous,
simulation-informed optimization in urban logistics. The system integrates
generative AI agents with domain-specific engines - such as Gurobi for
optimization and AnyLogic for agent-based simulation - forming a generative
digital twin capable of reasoning, planning, and acting across multimodal
freight networks. By incorporating integrated chatbots, retrieval-augmented
generation, and structured memory, the framework enables agents to interpret
user intent from natural language conversations, retrieve relevant datasets and
models, coordinate solvers and simulators, and execute complex workflows. We
demonstrate this approach through a freight decarbonization case study,
showcasing how MCP enables modular, interoperable, and adaptive agent behavior
across diverse toolchains. The results reveal that our system transforms
digital twins from static visualizations into autonomous, decision-capable
systems, advancing the frontiers of urban operations research. By enabling
context-aware, generative agents to operate scientific tools automatically and
collaboratively, this framework supports more intelligent, accessible, and
dynamic decision-making in transportation planning and smart city management.

TL;DR: 研究评估了拼车和共享乘车在德国农村地区通勤中的潜力，以减少CO2排放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德国交通部门占CO2排放的20%，农村地区通勤主要依赖私家车，拼车和共享乘车可能减少排放。

Method: 结合学生家庭地址和校园访问时间数据，构建需求场景，比较拼车、共享乘车与单独驾车的效果。

Result: 拼车能显著减少排放，效果取决于学生参与率和步行意愿；共享乘车的效果取决于车辆能效。

Conclusion: 拼车在农村通勤中具有减排潜力，共享乘车需更高效车辆才能体现优势。

Abstract: The transport sector accounts for about 20% of German CO2 emissions, with
commuter traffic contributing a significant part. Particularly in rural areas,
where public transport is inconvenient to use, private cars are a common choice
for commuting and most commuters travel alone in their cars. Consolidation of
some of these trips has the potential to decrease CO2 emissions and could be
achieved, e.g., by offering ridesharing (commuters with similar
origin-destination pairs share a car) or ridepooling (commuters are picked up
by shuttle services). In this study, we present a framework to assess the
potential of introducing new mobility modes like ridesharing and ridepooling
for commuting towards several locations in close vicinity to each other.
  We test our framework on the case of student mobility to the University of
W\"urzburg, a university with several campus locations and a big and rather
rural catchment area, where existing public transport options are inconvenient
and many students commute by car. We combine data on student home addresses and
campus visitation times to create demand scenarios. In our case study, we
compare the mobility modes of ridesharing and ridepooling to the base case,
where students travel by car on their own. We find that ridesharing has the
potential to greatly reduce emissions, depending on the percentage of students
willing to use the service and their willingness to walk to the departure
location. The benefit of ridepooling is less clear, materializing only if the
shuttle vehicles are more energy efficient than the student cars.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法难以解决复杂且多目标的经济排放调度问题，而现代AI技术因其易实现、高精度和低计算时间成为解决方案。

Method: 使用粒子群优化（PSO）和遗传算法（GA）在IEEE 30总线系统中实现经济排放调度，考虑多种气体排放。

Result: PSO和GA在解决经济排放调度问题时表现出高效性，结果相互比较验证了其准确性。

Conclusion: 现代AI技术（如PSO和GA）是解决复杂经济排放调度问题的有效工具，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The economic dispatch of generators is a major concern in thermal power
plants that governs the share of each generating unit with an objective of
minimizing fuel cost by fulfilling load demand. This problem is not as simple
as it looks because of system constraints that cannot be neglected practically.
Moreover, increased awareness of clean technology imposes another important
limit on the emission of pollutants obtained from burning of fossil fuels.
Classical optimization methods lack the ability of solving such a complex and
multi-objective problem. Hence, various modern artificial intelligence (AI)
techniques based on evolution and social behaviour of organisms are being used
to solve such problems because they are easier to implement, give accurate
results and take less computational time. In this work, a study is done on most
of the contemporary basic AI techniques being used in literature for power
systems in general and combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) in
particular. The dispatch problem is implemented on IEEE 30-bus benchmarked
system in MATLAB for different load demands considering all gases (COX, NOX and
SOX) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) and
their results are compared with each other.

Result: 成功实现整数集的编码与解码，但未考虑实际应用。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新审视自动编码和机器学习的假设，结合生物进化理论提供新思路。

Abstract: We present a handcrafted neural network that, without training, solves the
seemingly difficult problem of encoding an arbitrary set of integers into a
single numerical variable, and then recovering the original elements. While
using only standard neural network operations -- weighted sums with biases and
identity activation -- we make design choices that challenge common notions in
this area around representation, continuity of domains, computation,
learnability and more. For example, our construction is designed, not learned;
it represents multiple values using a single one by simply concatenating digits
without compression, and it relies on hardware-level truncation of rightmost
digits as a bit-manipulation mechanism. This neural net is not intended for
practical application. Instead, we see its resemblance to -- and deviation from
-- standard trained autoencoders as an invitation to examine assumptions that
may unnecessarily constrain the development of systems and models based on
autoencoding and machine learning. Motivated in part by our research on a
theory of biological evolution centered around natural autoencoding of species
characteristics, we conclude by refining the discussion with a biological
perspective.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FPT的并行训练方法，显著降低了SNN的训练时间复杂性，从O(T)降至O(K)，且不影响准确性。


<details>

Motivation: SNN因序列处理T个尖峰而具有高时间复杂性O(T)，导致训练计算成本高。

Method: 采用固定点迭代形式的LIF神经元，将时间复杂性降至O(K)（K为小常数，通常K=3）。

Result: FPT能有效模拟原始LIF神经元的动态，显著减少计算时间且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: FPT是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，尤其适用于长期任务。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) often suffer from high time complexity $O(T)$
due to the sequential processing of $T$ spikes, making training computationally
expensive.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Fixed-point Parallel Training (FPT) method
to accelerate SNN training without modifying the network architecture or
introducing additional assumptions.
  FPT reduces the time complexity to $O(K)$, where $K$ is a small constant
(usually $K=3$), by using a fixed-point iteration form of Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for all $T$ timesteps.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis of FPT and demonstrate that
existing parallel spiking neurons can be viewed as special cases of our
proposed method.
  Experimental results show that FPT effectively simulates the dynamics of
original LIF neurons, significantly reducing computational time without
sacrificing accuracy.
  This makes FPT a scalable and efficient solution for real-world applications,
particularly for long-term tasks.

Result: 在XJTU-SY轴承数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够检测早期故障及其前兆，并通过bagging回归器实现准确的RUL预测。

Conclusion: SFRFs结合了信号处理、生物感知原理和数据驱动的预测方法，为旋转机械的健康监测提供了可解释且高效的工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces Spectral Fault Receptive Fields (SFRFs), a biologically
inspired technique for degradation state assessment in bearing fault diagnosis
and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Drawing on the center-surround
organization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a
frequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of
fault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic
spectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory
surrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under
variable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization
strategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field
parameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing
feature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method
is demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its
suitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring
applications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs,
inspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary
optimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria;
and (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults
and their precursors. Furthermore, we confirm that our diagnosis-informed
spectral representation achieves accurate RUL prediction using a bagging
regressor. The results highlight the interpretability and principled design of
SFRFs, bridging signal processing, biological sensing principles, and
data-driven prognostics in rotating machinery.

Abstract: Active dendrites are the basis for biologically plausible neural networks
possessing many desirable features of the biological brain including
flexibility, dynamic adaptability, and energy efficiency. A formulation for
active dendrites using the notational language of conventional machine learning
is put forward as an alternative to a spiking neuron formulation. Based on this
formulation, neuromorphic dendrites are developed as basic neural building
blocks capable of dynamic online clustering. Features and capabilities of
neuromorphic dendrites are demonstrated via a benchmark drawn from experimental
neuroscience: spike sorting. Spike sorting takes inputs from electrical probes
implanted in neural tissue, detects voltage spikes (action potentials) emitted
by neurons, and attempts to sort the spikes according to the neuron that
emitted them. Many spike sorting methods form clusters based on the shapes of
action potential waveforms, under the assumption that spikes emitted by a given
neuron have similar shapes and will therefore map to the same cluster. Using a
stream of synthetic spike shapes, the accuracy of the proposed dendrite is
compared with the more compute-intensive, offline k-means clustering approach.
Overall, the dendrite outperforms k-means and has the advantage of requiring
only a single pass through the input stream, learning as it goes. The
capabilities of the neuromorphic dendrite are demonstrated for a number of
scenarios including dynamic changes in the input stream, differing neuron spike
rates, and varying neuron counts.

Method: 使用遗传算法（GA）优化反应器参数，结合概率分布函数（PDFs）进行不确定性分析，并通过模拟退火（SA）验证结果。

Result: 微反应器在支持政策下LCOE为48.21-78.32美元/MWh，资本成本对其影响最大，燃料成本影响较小。

Conclusion: 优化后的微反应器具有经济潜力，政策支持可显著降低成本，为决策者提供实用建议。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the cost competitiveness of microreactors in today's
electricity markets, with a focus on uncertainties in reactor costs. A Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize key technical parameters, such as reactor
capacity, fuel enrichment, tail enrichment, refueling interval, and discharge
burnup, to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Base case results are
validated using Simulated Annealing (SA). By incorporating Probability
Distribution Functions (PDFs) for fuel cycle costs, the study identifies
optimal configurations under uncertainty. Methodologically, it introduces a
novel framework combining probabilistic cost modeling with evolutionary
optimization. Results show that microreactors can remain cost-competitive, with
LCOEs ranging from \$48.21/MWh to \$78.32/MWh when supported by the Production
Tax Credit (PTC). High reactor capacity, low fuel enrichment, moderate tail
enrichment and refueling intervals, and high discharge burnup enhance cost
efficiency. Among all factors, overnight capital cost (OCC) has the most
significant impact on LCOE, while O&M and fuel cost uncertainties have lesser
effects. The analysis highlights how energy policies like the PTC can reduce
LCOE by 22-24%, improving viability despite cost variability. Compared to
conventional nuclear, coal, and renewable sources like offshore wind, hydro,
and biomass, optimized microreactors show strong economic potential. This
research defines a realistic design space and key trade-offs, offering
actionable insights for policymakers, reactor designers, and energy planners
aiming to accelerate the deployment of affordable, sustainable microreactors.

TL;DR: 论文通过微调Whisper模型，采用U2结构和CTC解码器，实现了流式自动语音识别（ASR），并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper模型缺乏对流式ASR的原生支持，因此需要改进以适应实时语音识别需求。

Method: 使用WeNet工具包，采用U2结构，引入CTC解码器生成流式部分转录，同时保留Whisper的解码器进行重排序。还提出混合分词器方法，优化数据效率和泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，经过适当微调后，Whisper可以成为高效的流式ASR模型。

Conclusion: 通过引入CTC解码器和混合分词器，Whisper成功适应了流式ASR任务，展现了良好的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: OpenAI Whisper is a family of robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
models trained on 680,000 hours of audio. However, its encoder-decoder
architecture, trained with a sequence-to-sequence objective, lacks native
support for streaming ASR. In this paper, we fine-tune Whisper for streaming
ASR using the WeNet toolkit by adopting a Unified Two-pass (U2) structure. We
introduce an additional Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoder
trained with causal attention masks to generate streaming partial transcripts,
while the original Whisper decoder reranks these partial outputs. Our
experiments on LibriSpeech and an earnings call dataset demonstrate that, with
adequate fine-tuning data, Whisper can be adapted into a capable streaming ASR
model. We also introduce a hybrid tokenizer approach, which uses a smaller
token space for the CTC decoder while retaining Whisper's original token space
for the attention decoder, resulting in improved data efficiency and
generalization.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从无声视频直接生成空间音频的方法，并引入了新数据集和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间音频能增强视听体验，但传统制作复杂且需要专业知识。

Method: 提出ViSAGe框架，利用CLIP视觉特征和自回归神经音频编解码器生成空间音频。

Result: ViSAGe生成的音频质量高，优于两阶段方法，并能适应视角变化。

Conclusion: ViSAGe为无声视频生成空间音频提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial audio is essential for enhancing the immersiveness of audio-visual
experiences, yet its production typically demands complex recording systems and
specialized expertise. In this work, we address a novel problem of generating
first-order ambisonics, a widely used spatial audio format, directly from
silent videos. To support this task, we introduce YT-Ambigen, a dataset
comprising 102K 5-second YouTube video clips paired with corresponding
first-order ambisonics. We also propose new evaluation metrics to assess the
spatial aspect of generated audio based on audio energy maps and saliency
metrics. Furthermore, we present Video-to-Spatial Audio Generation (ViSAGe), an
end-to-end framework that generates first-order ambisonics from silent video
frames by leveraging CLIP visual features, autoregressive neural audio codec
modeling with both directional and visual guidance. Experimental results
demonstrate that ViSAGe produces plausible and coherent first-order ambisonics,
outperforming two-stage approaches consisting of video-to-audio generation and
audio spatialization. Qualitative examples further illustrate that ViSAGe
generates temporally aligned high-quality spatial audio that adapts to
viewpoint changes.

*Tony Alex,Sara Ahmed,Armin Mustafa,Muhammad Awais,Philip JB Jackson*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SSLAM的自监督学习方法，旨在提升模型在复杂多音源音频数据上的表现，同时保持单音源数据上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督音频模型主要在单音源数据上测试，而实际场景多为多音源复杂音频，其泛化能力未被充分验证。

Method: 引入SSLAM方法，通过自监督学习从多音源音频中提取特征，并在单音源和多音源数据集上进行评估。

Result: SSLAM在单音源数据集AudioSet-2M上提升3.9%，在多音源数据集上提升达9.1%，均达到SOTA。

Conclusion: SSLAM显著提升了模型在多音源音频中的性能，同时保持单音源数据的表现，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-trained audio networks have seen widespread adoption in
real-world systems, particularly in multi-modal large language models. These
networks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the
SSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio.
However, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform
in real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex,
involving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are
often benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as
environmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to
generalize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios,
remains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical
robustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap,
we introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel
direction in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the
model's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong
performance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio
SSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a
comprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of
high-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves
model performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds
performance on standard audio SSL benchmarks. Notably, it achieves up to a
3.9\% improvement on the AudioSet-2M (AS-2M), reaching a mean average precision
(mAP) of 50.2. For polyphonic datasets, SSLAM sets new SOTA in both linear
evaluation and fine-tuning regimes with performance improvements of up to 9.1\%
(mAP).

*Wei Wang,Wangyou Zhang,Chenda Li,Jiatong Shi,Shinji Watanabe,Yanmin Qian*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用语音质量评估（SQA）模型指导语音增强（SE）训练的方法，解决了传统SE目标与感知质量不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音增强目标（如SI-SNR）与感知质量不一致且泛化能力差，SQA模型的潜力在SE训练中未充分探索。

Method: 使用SQA模型作为监督信号指导SE训练，该模型预测多个公共SE排行榜的评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，SQA指导的训练在多种质量指标上表现更优，适用于无干净参考的真实数据。

Conclusion: SQA模型能有效指导SE训练，提升性能并解决传统目标的局限性。

Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) aims to predict the perceived quality of
speech signals under a wide range of distortions. It is inherently connected to
speech enhancement (SE), which seeks to improve speech quality by removing
unwanted signal components. While SQA models are widely used to evaluate SE
performance, their potential to guide SE training remains underexplored. In
this work, we investigate a training framework that leverages a SQA model,
trained to predict multiple evaluation metrics from a public SE leaderboard, as
a supervisory signal for SE. This approach addresses a key limitation of
conventional SE objectives, such as SI-SNR, which often fail to align with
perceptual quality and generalize poorly across evaluation metrics. Moreover,
it enables training on real-world data where clean references are unavailable.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world test sets show that SQA-guided
training consistently improves performance across a range of quality metrics.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的图谱扩散网络（GSDNet），用于解决多模态情感识别中的模态缺失问题，通过将高斯噪声映射到图谱空间来恢复缺失数据，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MERC）在实际场景中因模态缺失问题性能受限，现有方法可能破坏图的连通性和局部结构。

Method: 提出GSDNet，将高斯噪声映射到缺失模态的图谱空间，根据原始分布恢复数据，保留全局拓扑信息和重要谱特征。

Result: GSDNet在多种模态缺失场景下实现了最先进的情感识别性能。

Conclusion: GSDNet通过图谱扩散方法有效解决了模态缺失问题，显著提升了MERC的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversations (MERC) aims to infer the
speaker's emotional state by analyzing utterance information from multiple
sources (i.e., video, audio, and text). Compared with unimodality, a more
robust utterance representation can be obtained by fusing complementary
semantic information from different modalities. However, the modality missing
problem severely limits the performance of MERC in practical scenarios. Recent
work has achieved impressive performance on modality completion using graph
neural networks and diffusion models, respectively. This inspires us to combine
these two dimensions through the graph diffusion model to obtain more powerful
modal recovery capabilities. Unfortunately, existing graph diffusion models may
destroy the connectivity and local structure of the graph by directly adding
Gaussian noise to the adjacency matrix, resulting in the generated graph data
being unable to retain the semantic and topological information of the original
graph. To this end, we propose a novel Graph Spectral Diffusion Network
(GSDNet), which maps Gaussian noise to the graph spectral space of missing
modalities and recovers the missing data according to its original
distribution. Compared with previous graph diffusion methods, GSDNet only
affects the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix instead of destroying the
adjacency matrix directly, which can maintain the global topological
information and important spectral features during the diffusion process.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GSDNet achieves state-of-the-art
emotion recognition performance in various modality loss scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当代流行音乐中谐波复合音的多重音高感知现象。

Method: 通过两项听力测试：评估单个谐波音的多重音高感知和手动转录谐波音序列，并分析信号特征与音高感知的关系。

Result: 合成谐波音比声学谐波音传递更多感知音高，且听众间差异显著；多重模糊音高与音调特性（如上部分音和特定自相关特征）相关。

Conclusion: 当代流行音乐中的谐波音通常能传达多个模糊音高，感知音高集取决于听众和聆听条件。

Abstract: Aims. This study suggests that the use of multiple perceived pitches arising
from a single harmonic complex tone is an active and intentional feature of
contemporary popular music. The phenomenon is illustrated through examples
drawn from the work of electronic artist Vitalic and others.
  Methods. Two listening tests were conducted: (1) evaluation of the number of
simultaneous pitches perceived from single harmonic tones, and (2) manual pitch
transcription of sequences of harmonic tones. Relationships between signal
characteristics and pitch perception were then analyzed.
  Results. The synthetic harmonic tones found in the musical sequences under
study were observed to transmit more perceived pitches than their acoustic
counterparts, with significant variation across listeners. Multiple ambiguous
pitches were associated with tone properties such as prominent upper partials
and particular autocorrelation profiles.
  Conclusions. Harmonic tones in a context of contemporary popular music can,
in general, convey several ambiguous pitches. The set of perceived pitches
depends on both the listener and the listening conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive systematic review of literature
on style-based composer identification and authorship attribution in symbolic
music scores. Addressing the critical need for improved reliability and
reproducibility in this field, the review rigorously analyzes 58 peer-reviewed
papers published across various historical periods, with the search adapted to
evolving terminology. The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires,
computational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting
significant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing
research suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on
simple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the
credibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like
Balanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results
is emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the
evolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship
attribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin
Desprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the
opportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve
disputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable
guidelines for future research are proposed. These recommendations are designed
to significantly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and musicological
validity of composer identification and authorship attribution studies,
fostering more robust and interpretable computational stylistic analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式TTS系统多采用多阶段流水线和离散表示，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。

Method: StreamMel通过交错文本标记和声学帧，实现单阶段流式mel频谱建模。

Result: 实验表明，StreamMel在质量和延迟上优于现有流式TTS基线，甚至接近离线系统性能。

Conclusion: StreamMel展示了与实时语音大语言模型集成的广阔前景。

Abstract: Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis have achieved
high-quality speech generation for unseen speakers, but most systems remain
unsuitable for real-time applications because of their offline design. Current
streaming TTS paradigms often rely on multi-stage pipelines and discrete
representations, leading to increased computational cost and suboptimal system
performance. In this work, we propose StreamMel, a pioneering single-stage
streaming TTS framework that models continuous mel-spectrograms. By
interleaving text tokens with acoustic frames, StreamMel enables low-latency,
autoregressive synthesis while preserving high speaker similarity and
naturalness. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that StreamMel outperforms
existing streaming TTS baselines in both quality and latency. It even achieves
performance comparable to offline systems while supporting efficient real-time
generation, showcasing broad prospects for integration with real-time speech
large language models. Audio samples are available at:

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了MusicGen-Medium在分布和配对保真度上的表现，以及主观情绪和类型兼容性。

Conclusion: OSSL数据集和视频适配器为电影音乐生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in music generation systems, their application in
film production remains limited, as they struggle to capture the nuances of
real-world filmmaking, where filmmakers consider multiple factors-such as
visual content, dialogue, and emotional tone-when selecting or composing music
for a scene. This limitation primarily stems from the absence of comprehensive
datasets that integrate these elements. To address this gap, we introduce Open
Screen Sound Library (OSSL), a dataset consisting of movie clips from public
domain films, totaling approximately 36.5 hours, paired with high-quality
soundtracks and human-annotated mood information. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset in improving the performance of pre-trained models
on film music generation tasks, we introduce a new video adapter that enhances
an autoregressive transformer-based text-to-music model by adding video-based
conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach
effectively enhances MusicGen-Medium in terms of both objective measures of
distributional and paired fidelity, and subjective compatibility in mood and
genre. The dataset and code are available at

Motivation: 现有神经网络推理工具无法满足实时音频应用的需求，因此开发了anira。

Method: anira支持ONNX Runtime、LibTorch和TensorFlow Lite作为后端，通过静态线程池解耦推理和音频回调，并内置延迟管理和基准测试功能。

Result: 对于无状态模型，ONNX Runtime运行时间最短；对于有状态模型，LibTorch性能最佳。某些模型-引擎组合的初始推理时间较长。

Conclusion: anira为实时音频应用提供了一种高效的解决方案，不同后端适用于不同类型的模型。

Abstract: Numerous tools for neural network inference are currently available, yet many
do not meet the requirements of real-time audio applications. In response, we
introduce anira, an efficient cross-platform library. To ensure compatibility
with a broad range of neural network architectures and frameworks, anira
supports ONNX Runtime, LibTorch, and TensorFlow Lite as backends. Each
inference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by
decoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The
library incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking
capabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different
neural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to
benchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to
identify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate
that for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For
stateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance. Our results
also indicate that for certain model-engine combinations, the initial
inferences take longer, particularly when these inferences exhibit a higher
incidence of real-time violations.

Motivation: 研究发现SOT在重叠语音处理中存在隐式说话人分离不足的问题，需更明确的说话人信息。

Method: SC-SOT通过引入说话人嵌入和说话人活动信息显式增强解码器，说话人嵌入来自联合训练的端到端说话人日志模型。

Result: 实验证明该方法在重叠语音处理中效果显著。

Conclusion: SC-SOT通过显式说话人条件化有效提升了多说话人语音识别的性能。

Abstract: We propose Speaker-Conditioned Serialized Output Training (SC-SOT), an
enhanced SOT-based training for E2E multi-talker ASR. We first probe how SOT
handles overlapped speech, and we found the decoder performs implicit speaker
separation. We hypothesize this implicit separation is often insufficient due
to ambiguous acoustic cues in overlapping regions. To address this, SC-SOT
explicitly conditions the decoder on speaker information, providing detailed
information about "who spoke when". Specifically, we enhance the decoder by
incorporating: (1) speaker embeddings, which allow the model to focus on the
acoustic characteristics of the target speaker, and (2) speaker activity
information, which guides the model to suppress non-target speakers. The
speaker embeddings are derived from a jointly trained E2E speaker diarization
model, mitigating the need for speaker enrollment. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our conditioning approach on overlapped
speech.

Abstract: Existing work in automatic music generation has primarily focused on
end-to-end systems that produce complete compositions or continuations.
However, because musical composition is typically an iterative process, such
systems make it difficult to engage in the back-and-forth between human and
machine that is essential to computer-assisted creativity. In this study, we
address the task of personalizable, multi-track, long-context, and controllable
symbolic music infilling to enhance the process of computer-assisted
composition. We present MIDI-RWKV, a novel model based on the RWKV-7 linear
architecture, to enable efficient and coherent musical cocreation on edge
devices. We also demonstrate that MIDI-RWKV admits an effective method of
finetuning its initial state for personalization in the very-low-sample regime.
We evaluate MIDI-RWKV and its state tuning on several quantitative and
qualitative metrics, and release model weights and code at

Conclusion: I²S-TFCKD框架有效解决了语音增强任务中复杂度和性能的平衡问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, complexity compression of neural network (NN)-based speech
enhancement (SE) models has gradually attracted the attention of researchers,
especially in scenarios with limited hardware resources or strict latency
requirements. The main difficulties and challenges lie in achieving a balance
between complexity and performance according to the characteristics of the
task. In this paper, we propose an intra-inter set knowledge distillation (KD)
framework with time-frequency calibration (I$^2$S-TFCKD) for SE. Different from
previous distillation strategies for SE, the proposed framework fully utilizes
the time-frequency differential information of speech while promoting global
knowledge flow. Firstly, we propose a multi-layer interactive distillation
based on dual-stream time-frequency cross-calibration, which calculates the
teacher-student similarity calibration weights in the time and frequency
domains respectively and performs cross-weighting, thus enabling refined
allocation of distillation contributions across different layers according to
speech characteristics. Secondly, we construct a collaborative distillation
paradigm for intra-set and inter-set correlations. Within a correlated set,
multi-layer teacher-student features are pairwise matched for calibrated
distillation. Subsequently, we generate representative features from each
correlated set through residual fusion to form the fused feature set that
enables inter-set knowledge interaction. The proposed distillation strategy is
applied to the dual-path dilated convolutional recurrent network (DPDCRN) that
ranked first in the SE track of the L3DAS23 challenge. Objective evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed KD strategy consistently and effectively improves
the performance of the low-complexity student model and outperforms other
distillation schemes.

Result: 发现三种距离定义在一维持久同调中存在包含关系，并通过真实音乐数据验证了这一结果。

Conclusion: 距离定义的选择对持久同调分析有显著影响，研究结果为音乐数据的拓扑分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Persistent homology has been widely used to discover hidden topological
structures in data across various applications, including music data. To apply
persistent homology, a distance or metric must be defined between points in a
point cloud or between nodes in a graph network. These definitions are not
unique and depend on the specific objectives of a given problem. In other
words, selecting different metric definitions allows for multiple topological
inferences. In this work, we focus on applying persistent homology to music
graph with predefined weights. We examine three distinct distance definitions
based on edge-wise pathways and demonstrate how these definitions affect
persistent barcodes, persistence diagrams, and birth/death edges. We found that
there exist inclusion relations in one-dimensional persistent homology
reflected on persistence barcode and diagram among these three distance
definitions. We verified these findings using real music data.

Motivation: 未来GPU和网络交换机需要超高带宽、高密度和能效，共封装光学（CPO）和微环调制器（MRM）因其紧凑性和高效性成为潜在解决方案，但需更高级调制格式（如QAM-16）以实现更高速率。

Method: 利用MRM实现相位恒定幅度调制，构建偏移QAM-16发射器，通过商用硅光子工艺仿真和评估性能，并进行热稳定性分析。

Result: 设计实现了400 Gb/s速率，光学激光功率为9.65 dBm，面积比传统QAM-16 MZI链路小10-100倍，并通过实验验证了25 Gb/s的偏移QAM-4调制。

Conclusion: MRM-based C2PO发射器在高速率和低功耗方面具有潜力，为未来AI硬件提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Co-packaged optics (CPO) has emerged as a promising solution for achieving
the ultra-high bandwidths, shoreline densities, and energy efficiencies
required by future GPUs and network switches for AI. Microring modulators
(MRMs) are well suited for transmitters due to their compact size, high energy
efficiency, and natural compatibility with dense wavelength-division
multiplexing (DWDM). However, extending beyond the recently demonstrated 200
Gb/s will require more advanced modulation formats, such as higher-order
coherent modulation (e.g., QAM-16).
  In this work, we show how microring resonators (MRMs) can be efficiently used
to implement phase-constant amplitude modulators and form the building blocks
of a transmitter for offset QAM-16, which has been shown to simplify
carrier-phase recovery relative to conventional QAM. We simulate and evaluate
the performance of our proposed MRM-based coherent CPO (C2PO) transmitters
using a foundry-provided commercial silicon photonics process, demonstrating an
input-normalized electric field amplitude contrast of 0.64 per dimension.
Through full link-level bit error rate modeling, we show that our design
achieves 400 Gb/s using offset QAM-16 at a total optical laser power of 9.65
dBm-comparable to that required by conventional QAM-16 MZI-based links, despite
using 10-100x less area. We further conduct a thermal simulation to assess the
transmitter's thermal stability at the MRM input optical power required to meet
a target BER at the desired data rates. Finally, as a proof of concept, we
demonstrate 25 Gb/s MRM-based offset QAM-4 modulation with a chip fabricated in
the GlobalFoundries 45 nm monolithic silicon photonics process.

Abstract: 'The cardinal sin in control is to believe that the plant is given' Karl
Astrom. Astrom, a towering figure of control theory and practice and awardee of
the 1993 IEEE Medal of Honor for his work on adaptive control, provides this
assessment of the obstinate part of realizing a feedback controller. And yet we
are exhorted to rely on solely-data-driven methods of control design skipping
the modeling and plant identification phases entirely. What is going on? Whom
should we trust? How do we reconcile the implied ease (or indeed avoidance) of
modeling with the steely focus on robustness of the control and the capacity of
feedback to accommodate uncertainty? This paper seeks to investigate this
subject with the objective of appreciating not whom to trust but what are the
circumstances where the direct paradigm of control design from any lightly
qualified data set provides a sensible way forward. Here is a clue: It depends
on the confidence of your contentions about the plant system, the detailed data
themselves and your appetite for failure.
  The paper attempts to segue repeatedly between the broad philosophical
context and hard engineering examples. To instantiate ideas and add detail to
vagaries, we incorporate a number of examples, each validated by their
demonstrated commercial and industrial viability and each terminating with ein
Blickwinkel or perspective in German. As David Wallace-Wells poses, before
investing hundreds of billions of dollars we really ought to ask what is the
trillion-dollar problem which might potentially be solved. By sticking to
industrially proven technologies, we hope to delineate what works suitably well
in practice or was judged worthy of the risk.

examples, and simulation results are provided.

Conclusion: 策略性链接添加可显著提升影响者社会权力，方法适用于不同网络拓扑。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of leadership development for an external
influencer using the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model, where the
influencer is modeled as a fully stubborn agent and leadership is quantified by
social power. The influencer seeks to maximize her social power by
strategically adding a limited number of links to regular agents. This
optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the absorbing
probability to the influencer in an augmented Markov chain. The resulting
objective function is both monotone and submodular, enabling the use of a
greedy algorithm to compute an approximate solution. To handle large-scale
networks efficiently, a random walk sampling over the Markov chain is employed
to reduce computational complexity. Analytical characterizations of the
solution are provided for both low and high stubbornness of regular agents.
Specific network topologies are also examined: for complete graphs with
rank-one weight matrices, the problem reduces to a hyperbolic 0-1 programmming
problem, which is solvable in polynomial time; for symmetric ring graphs with
circulant weight matrices and uniform agent stubbornness, the optimal strategy
involves selecting agents that are sufficiently dispersed across the network.
Numerical simulations are presented for illustration.

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在松弛度上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应增益调度控制器设计方法有效减少了保守性，并通过数值实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: The synthesis of adaptive gain-scheduling controller is discussed for
continuous-time linear models characterized by polytopic uncertainties. The
proposed approach computes the control law assuming the parameters as uncertain
and adaptively provides an estimate for the gain-scheduling implementation.
Conservativeness is reduced using our recent results on describing uncertainty:
i) a structural relaxation that casts the parameters as outer terms and
introduces slack variables; and ii) a precise topological representation that
describes the mismatch between the uncertainty and its estimate. Numerical
examples illustrate a high degree of relaxation in comparison with the
state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 基于PBNE的策略在对抗环境中更有效，为代理行为设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper investigates how an autonomous agent can transmit information
through its motion in an adversarial setting. We consider scenarios where an
agent must reach its goal while deceiving an intelligent observer about its
destination. We model this interaction as a dynamic Bayesian game between a
mobile Attacker with a privately known goal and a Defender who infers the
Attacker's intent to allocate defensive resources effectively. We use Perfect
Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (PBNE) as our solution concept and propose a
computationally efficient approach to find it. In the resulting equilibrium,
the Defender employs a simple Markovian strategy, while the Attacker
strategically balances deception and goal efficiency by stochastically mixing
shortest and non-shortest paths to manipulate the Defender's beliefs. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the advantages of our PBNE-based strategies over
existing methods based on one-sided optimization.

Result: 在合作导航任务中，该方法在收敛速度和最终协调成功率上优于独立学习基线。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效促进团队行为一致性，同时保留智能体的专业化能力。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) demands principled
mechanisms to align heterogeneous policies while preserving the capacity for
specialized behavior. We introduce a novel consensus framework that defines the
team strategy as the entropic-regularized $p$-Wasserstein barycenter of agents'
joint state--action visitation measures. By augmenting each agent's policy
objective with a soft penalty proportional to its Sinkhorn divergence from this
barycenter, the proposed approach encourages coherent group behavior without
enforcing rigid parameter sharing. We derive an algorithm that alternates
between Sinkhorn-barycenter computation and policy-gradient updates, and we
prove that, under standard Lipschitz and compactness assumptions, the maximal
pairwise policy discrepancy contracts at a geometric rate. Empirical evaluation
on a cooperative navigation case study demonstrates that our OT-barycenter
consensus outperforms an independent learners baseline in convergence speed and
final coordination success.

Conclusion: Constrained Diffusers框架有效解决了扩散模型在约束条件下的安全问题，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in planning and control
tasks due to their ability to represent multimodal distributions over actions
and trajectories. However, ensuring safety under constraints remains a critical
challenge for diffusion models. This paper proposes Constrained Diffusers, a
novel framework that incorporates constraints into pre-trained diffusion models
without retraining or architectural modifications. Inspired by constrained
optimization, we apply a constrained Langevin sampling mechanism for the
reverse diffusion process that jointly optimizes the trajectory and realizes
constraint satisfaction through three iterative algorithms: projected method,
primal-dual method and augmented Lagrangian approaches. In addition, we
incorporate discrete control barrier functions as constraints for constrained
diffusers to guarantee safety in online implementation. Experiments in Maze2D,
locomotion, and pybullet ball running tasks demonstrate that our proposed
methods achieve constraint satisfaction with less computation time, and are
competitive to existing methods in environments with static and time-varying
constraints.

Abstract: Designing controllers for complex industrial electronic systems is
challenging due to nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties, and traditional
methods are often slow and costly. To address this, we propose a novel
autonomous design framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy: an LLM intelligently
explores and iteratively improves the control algorithm's structure, while a
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm efficiently refines the parameters
for any given structure. This method achieves end-to-end automated design.
Validated through a simulation of a DC-DC Boost converter, our framework
successfully evolved a basic controller into a high-performance adaptive
version that met all stringent design specifications for fast response, low
error, and robustness. This work presents a new paradigm for control design
that significantly enhances automation and efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents experimental validation of a time-domain load parameter
determination method for single-phase circuits. The verification is performed
in a state-of-the-art smart grid laboratory equipped with power hardware and
real-time emulators. The proposed method enables the identification of circuit
parameters using only instantaneous voltage and current measurements at the
point of common coupling. The experimental setup includes a range of test cases
covering linear and non-sinusoidal single-phase conditions. Voltage and current
waveforms are acquired, preprocessed, and used to calculate the relevant
circuit parameters. The experimental results demonstrate a high degree of
accuracy and robustness, with minimal percentage errors across all test cases.
The identified parameters show excellent agreement with the theoretical
expectations, confirming the validity and applicability of the proposed method
to identify the load of single-phase systems. This validation highlights the
potential of the method for improved monitoring, control, and protection of
smart grids, paving the way for future extensions to three-phase systems and
real-time implementations.

Result: 平均提升13%吞吐量和25%能效。

Conclusion: ECLIP有效解决了GPU资源分区中的能耗和效率问题。

Abstract: As AI inference becomes mainstream, research has begun to focus on improving
the energy consumption of inference servers. Inference kernels commonly
underutilize a GPU's compute resources and waste power from idling components.
To improve utilization and energy efficiency, multiple models can co-locate and
share the GPU. However, typical GPU spatial partitioning techniques often
experience significant overheads when reconfiguring spatial partitions, which
can waste additional energy through repartitioning overheads or non-optimal
partition configurations. In this paper, we present ECLIP, a framework to
enable low-overhead energy-efficient kernel-wise resource partitioning between
co-located inference kernels. ECLIP minimizes repartitioning overheads by
pre-allocating pools of CU masked streams and assigns optimal CU assignments to
groups of kernels through our resource allocation optimizer. Overall, ECLIP
achieves an average of 13% improvement to throughput and 25% improvement to
energy efficiency.

Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate enough dynamical models are vital for
real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a
computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a
lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we
review state-of-the-art nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a
theoretical comparison of method properties. Additionally, we discuss both
general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for (chemical) process systems
and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As
manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the
construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to
dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight
established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model:
POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode
decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor,
compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate
hyperreduction (reduction of FLOPS). Based on our findings, we discuss
strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.

Abstract: Vehicle state estimation presents a fundamental challenge for autonomous
driving systems, requiring both physical interpretability and the ability to
capture complex nonlinear behaviors across diverse operating conditions.
Traditional methodologies often rely exclusively on either physics-based or
data-driven models, each with complementary strengths and limitations that
become most noticeable during critical scenarios. This paper presents a novel
consensus multi-model Kalman filter framework that integrates heterogeneous
model types to leverage their complementary strengths while minimizing
individual weaknesses. We introduce two distinct methodologies for handling
covariance propagation in data-driven models: a Koopman operator-based
linearization approach enabling analytical covariance propagation, and an
ensemble-based method providing unified uncertainty quantification across model
types without requiring pretraining. Our approach implements an iterative
consensus fusion procedure that dynamically weighs different models based on
their demonstrated reliability in current operating conditions. The
experimental results conducted on an electric all-wheel-drive Equinox vehicle
demonstrate performance improvements over single-model techniques, with
particularly significant advantages during challenging maneuvers and varying
road conditions, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
methodology for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Wind energy significantly contributes to the global shift towards renewable
energy, yet operational challenges, such as Leading-Edge Erosion on wind
turbine blades, notably reduce energy output. This study introduces an
advanced, scalable machine learning framework for condition monitoring of wind
turbines, specifically targeting improved detection of anomalies using
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. The framework effectively
isolates normal turbine behavior through rigorous preprocessing, incorporating
domain-specific rules and anomaly detection filters, including Gaussian Mixture
Models and a predictive power score. The data cleaning and feature selection
process enables identification of deviations indicative of performance
degradation, facilitating estimates of annual energy production losses. The
data preprocessing methods resulted in significant data reduction, retaining on
average 31% of the original SCADA data per wind farm. Notably, 24 out of 35
turbines exhibited clear performance declines. At the same time, seven
improved, and four showed no significant changes when employing the power curve
feature set, which consisted of wind speed and ambient temperature. Models such
as Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN consistently captured subtle but persistent
declines in turbine performance. The developed framework provides a novel
approach to existing condition monitoring methodologies by isolating normal
operational data and estimating annual energy loss, which can be a key part in
reducing maintenance expenditures and mitigating economic impacts from turbine
downtime.

Abstract: Real-time adaptive control of nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics and
time-varying disturbances demands precise modeling and robust parameter
adaptation. While existing neural network-based strategies struggle with
computational inefficiency or inadequate temporal dependencies, this study
proposes a hybrid control framework integrating a Temporal-Gated Radial Basis
Function (TGRBF) network with a nonlinear robust controller. The TGRBF
synergizes radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) and gated recurrent
units (GRUs) through dynamic gating, enabling efficient offline system
identification and online temporal modeling with minimal parameter overhead
(14.5% increase vs. RBFNNs). During control execution, an event-triggered
optimization mechanism activates momentum-explicit gradient descent to refine
network parameters, leveraging historical data to suppress overfitting while
maintaining real-time feasibility. Concurrently, the nonlinear controller
adaptively tunes its gains via Jacobian-driven rules derived from the TGRBF
model, ensuring rapid error convergence and disturbance rejection.
Lyapunov-based analysis rigorously guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of
both tracking errors and adaptive parameters. Simulations on a nonlinear
benchmark system demonstrate the framework's superiority: compared to PID and
fixed-gain robust controllers, the proposed method reduces settling time by
14.2%, limits overshoot to 10%, and achieves 48.4% lower integral time-weighted
absolute error under dynamic disturbances. By unifying data-driven adaptability
with stability-guaranteed control, this work advances real-time performance in
partially observable, time-varying industrial systems.

Abstract: The efficient operation of greenhouses is essential for enhancing crop yield
while minimizing energy costs. This paper investigates a control strategy that
integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to
optimize economic benefits in autonomous greenhouses. Previous research has
explored the use of RL and MPC for greenhouse control individually, or by using
MPC as the function approximator for the RL agent. This study introduces the
RL-Guided MPC framework, where a RL policy is trained and then used to
construct a terminal cost and terminal region constraint for the MPC
optimization problem. This approach leverages the ability to handle
uncertainties of RL with MPC's online optimization to improve overall control
performance. The RL-Guided MPC framework is compared with both MPC and RL via
numerical simulations. Two scenarios are considered: a deterministic
environment and an uncertain environment. Simulation results demonstrate that,
in both environments, RL-Guided MPC outperforms both RL and MPC with shorter
prediction horizons.

Motivation: 分布式能源资源（DERs）的集成为辅助服务（如频率和电压支持、拥塞管理）提供了新的灵活性机会，但需要确保控制器的稳定性和可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种分层控制架构，重点关注在可行运行区域（FOR）内系统状态的安全过渡，并通过仿真分析参数调优的影响。

Result: 研究表明，控制器的稳定性对参数调优（如增益和灵敏度近似）敏感，不当调优可能导致振荡或不稳定行为。

Conclusion: 为确保在全灵活性范围内的可靠运行，需要系统性地选择控制器参数。

Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into sub-transmission
systems has enabled new opportunities for flexibility provision in ancillary
services such as frequency and voltage support, as well as congestion
management. This paper investigates the stability and performance of Online
Feedback Optimization (OFO) controllers in ensuring reliable flexibility
provision. A hierarchical control architecture is proposed, emphasizing safe
transitions between system states within the Feasible Operating Region (FOR).
We evaluate the controller's stability and performance through simulations of
transitions to the vertices of the FOR, analyzing the impact of tuning
parameters. The study demonstrates that controller stability is sensitive to
parameter tuning, particularly gain and sensitivity approximations. Results
demonstrate that improper tuning can lead to oscillatory or unstable behavior,
highlighting the need for systematic parameter selection to ensure reliable
operation across the full flexibility range.

Motivation: 电网级频率调节需求与逆变器资源（IBRs）的多样化需求之间存在冲突，需要一种高效的方法来协调和优化这些需求。

Method: 通过参数化建模量化电网需求，定义可行参数区域，并基于此建立多目标优化模型；采用纳什议价博弈方法在VPP内分配调节需求。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能有效提升频率稳定性并改善IBRs间的协调性。

Conclusion: 所提出的多目标优化方法在电网频率调节中表现出高效性和协调性，为IBRs的聚合提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach for
grid-level frequency regulation by aggregating inverter-based resources (IBRs).
Virtual power plants (VPPs), acting as aggregators, can efficiently respond to
dynamic response requirements from the grid. Through parametric modeling,
grid-level frequency regulation requirements are accurately quantified and
translated into a feasible parameter region defined by device-level parameters.
Based on this feasible region, an MOO model is developed to address the
conflicting demands of IBRs during frequency response. A Nash bargaining
game-based approach is then employed to optimally allocate regulation
requirements within the VPP, balancing the various demands of the IBRs.
Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
enhancing frequency stability and improving coordination among IBRs.

Result: 发现无功负载设定点和电流控制器前馈增益对GFL逆变器系统稳定性影响最大，而电压控制器前馈增益对GFM逆变器起主导作用。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来逆变器主导的电力系统提供了简化的分析和控制方法，减少了参数空间和模型复杂度。

Abstract: This paper investigates voltage stability in inverter-based power systems
concerning fold and saddle-node bifurcations. An analytical expression is
derived for the sensitivity of the stability margin using the normal vector to
the bifurcation hypersurface. Such information enables efficient identification
of effective control parameters in mitigating voltage instability.
Comprehensive analysis reveals that reactive loading setpoint and current
controller's feedforward gain are the most influential parameters for enhancing
voltage stability in a grid-following (GFL) inverter system, while the voltage
controller's feedforward gain plays a dominant role in a grid-forming (GFM)
inverter. Notably, both theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that
transmission line dynamics have no impact on fold/saddle-node bifurcations in
these systems. Results in this paper provide insights for efficient analysis
and control in future inverter-dominated power systems through reductions in
parameter space and model complexity.

Result: 在11种故障场景中实现100%检测成功率，无漏报或误报，且计算和内存需求极低。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于电池管理系统的实时部署，具有高效和轻量化的优势。

Abstract: This letter proposes a lightweight, model-free online diagnostic framework
for detecting internal short circuits (ISC) in single lithium-ion cells under
dynamic operating conditions. The core of the method lies in computing the
first-order difference of pseudo open-circuit voltage
($\boldsymbol{\mathrm{OCV}_{\text{pseudo}}}$) to extract high-frequency
deviations caused by ISC events from low-frequency polarization variations. The
method relies solely on terminal voltage, current measurements, and an offline
$R_0$--SOC look-up table, thereby eliminating the need for electrochemical or
equivalent-circuit observers. Validated on ten real and one false fault
scenarios, the proposed approach achieves a 100\% detection success rate with
no missed or false alarms. In addition, the proposed method exhibits extremely
low computational and memory requirements, making it highly suitable for
real-time deployment in battery management systems (BMS).

Abstract: We consider trajectory tracking for minimum-phase nonlinear systems in
Byrnes-Isidori form using the model-following control (MFC) architecture. The
tracking problem is motivated by a hierarchical control concept where a
higher-level instance provides the reference trajectory at run-time. We present
a computational efficient implementation of the feedback linearisation MFC
design, and apply high-gain feedback in the process control loop (PCL) to
achieve practical tracking in presence of Lipschitz perturbations. Our main
results establish ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and give a
constructive bound for the high-gain scaling parameter to achieve arbitrary
tracking precision. Further we establish that the peaking phenomenon can be
attenuated using MFC. We demonstrate the results via an automotive case study
considering advanced engine-based cruise control.

Abstract: Reachability analysis for hybrid nonaffine systems remains computationally
challenging, as existing set representations--including constrained,
polynomial, and hybrid zonotopes--either lose tightness under high-order
nonaffine maps or suffer exponential blow-up after discrete jumps. This paper
introduces Hybrid Polynomial Zonotope (HPZ), a novel set representation that
combines the mode-dependent generator structure of hybrid zonotopes with the
algebraic expressiveness of polynomial zonotopes. HPZs compactly encode
non-convex reachable states across modes by attaching polynomial exponents to
each hybrid generator, enabling precise capture of high-order state-input
couplings without vertex enumeration. We develop a comprehensive library of HPZ
operations, including Minkowski sum, linear transformation, and intersection.
Theoretical analysis and computational experiments demonstrate that HPZs
achieve superior tightness preservation and computational efficiency compared
to existing approaches for hybrid system reachability analysis.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are the enabling power source for transportation
electrification. However, in real-world applications, they remain vulnerable to
internal short circuits (ISCs) and the consequential risk of thermal runaway
(TR). Toward addressing the challenge of ISCs and TR, we undertake a systematic
study that extends from dynamic modeling to fault detection in this paper.
First, we develop {\em BattBee}, the first equivalent circuit model to
specifically describe the onset of ISCs and the evolution of subsequently
induced TR. Drawing upon electrochemical modeling, the model can simulate ISCs
at different severity levels and predict their impact on the initiation and
progression of TR events. With the physics-inspired design, this model offers
strong physical interpretability and predictive accuracy, while maintaining
structural simplicity to allow fast computation. Then, building upon the
BattBee model, we develop fault detection observers and derive detection
criteria together with decision-making logics to identify the occurrence and
emergence of ISC and TR events. This detection approach is principled in design
and fast in computation, lending itself to practical applications. Validation
based on simulations and experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of
both the BattBee model and the ISC/TR detection approach. The research outcomes
underscore this study's potential for real-world battery safety risk
management.
