### [1] [Can ChatGPT Perform Image Splicing Detection? A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05358)
*Souradip Nath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4V在图像取证领域展示了强大的零样本能力，尤其在检测图像拼接操作时表现优异，准确率超过85%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GPT-4V在图像取证任务中的零样本能力，探索其在检测图像拼接操作时的潜力。

Method: 使用三种提示策略（零样本、少样本和思维链）在CASIA v2.0数据集上评估GPT-4V的性能。

Result: GPT-4V在零样本设置下表现优异，思维链提示在真实和拼接图像间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-4V不及专用模型，但其通用性、可解释性和百科全书式推理能力使其成为图像取证领域的灵活工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

*Taminul Islam,Toqi Tahamid Sarker,Mohamed G Embaby,Khaled R Ahmed,Amer AbuGhazaleh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CarboNeXT是一个用于光学气体成像（OGI）的语义分割框架，用于检测和量化CO₂排放，在低流量场景中表现优异，并支持实时监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CO₂排放是环境和工业过程的重要指标，尤其是在畜牧业管理中。开发高效工具以精确监测和分析CO₂排放具有重要意义。

Method: 结合多尺度上下文聚合网络、UPerHead和辅助FCN组件，构建CarboNeXT框架，并提出了两个新数据集（CCR和RTA）。

Result: CarboNeXT在CCR和RTA数据集上的mIoU分别达到88.46%和92.95%，实时性能为60.95 FPS。轻量级变体CarboFormer在资源受限平台上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为CO₂排放分析提供了高效工具，特别适用于畜牧业管理，并推动了环境传感技术的发展。

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on
livestock applications.

### [3] [Scalable Generation of Spatial Transcriptomics from Histology Images via Whole-Slide Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05361)
*Tinglin Huang,Tianyu Liu,Mehrtash Babadi,Wengong Jin,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STFlow是一种基于流匹配的生成模型，通过建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布来考虑细胞间相互作用，解决了现有方法在内存和独立性预测上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）技术受限于低通量和实验设施需求，现有预测方法未能有效建模细胞间相互作用且面临内存问题。

Method: 提出STFlow模型，采用流匹配生成方法建模基因表达联合分布，并设计高效的切片级编码器与局部空间注意力机制。

Result: 在HEST-1k和STImage-1K4M基准测试中，STFlow显著优于现有方法，相对病理基础模型提升18%以上。

Conclusion: STFlow通过改进建模和编码效率，为空间转录组学数据分析提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

### [4] [Seed Selection for Human-Oriented Image Reconstruction via Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05363)
*Yui Tatsumi,Ziyue Zeng,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于种子选择的方法，通过多候选种子优化图像质量，无需增加比特率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要额外信息实现可扩展性，而现有扩散方法虽无需额外比特率，但单随机种子可能导致图像质量不佳。

Method: 从多个候选种子中选择最优种子，基于反向扩散过程的早期中间输出以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多项指标上优于基线。

Conclusion: 种子选择方法显著提升图像质量且不增加比特率。

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

### [5] [Text2Stereo: Repurposing Stable Diffusion for Stereo Generation with Consistency Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05367)
*Aakash Garg,Libing Zeng,Andrii Tsarov,Nima Khademi Kalantari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的文本到立体图像生成方法，利用Stable Diffusion的预训练模型，并通过微调和奖励函数优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大基线立体图像数据集稀缺，从头训练扩散模型不可行，因此利用现有模型的强先验知识。

Method: 微调Stable Diffusion模型，结合提示对齐和立体一致性奖励函数优化生成结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样场景中生成高质量立体图像，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了立体图像生成问题，并显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

### [6] [Speaking images. A novel framework for the automated self-description of artworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05368)
*Valentine Bernasconi,Gustavo Marfia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用生成式AI技术自动生成自解释文化艺术品视频的新框架，结合开源大语言模型、人脸检测等技术，探讨了数字图像的可塑性及其教育潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的突破为艺术与文化遗产领域提供了新视角，需创新方法以提升数字藏品的可访问性与内容展示。

Method: 基于自主图像概念，结合开源大语言模型、人脸检测、文本转语音和音频转动画技术，从数字化艺术品自动生成解释性视频。

Result: 实现了从艺术品到自解释视频的自动化生成，同时探讨了大语言模型的文化偏见、数字图像的教育潜力及艺术史领域的担忧。

Conclusion: 该框架为文化遗产的数字创新提供了新思路，但也需关注技术应用中的文化偏见与伦理问题。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

### [8] [SAVVY: Spatial Awareness via Audio-Visual LLMs through Seeing and Hearing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05414)
*Mingfei Chen,Zijun Cui,Xiulong Liu,Jinlin Xiang,Caleb Zheng,Jingyuan Li,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAVVY-Bench是首个针对动态场景中3D空间推理的基准测试，结合了同步空间音频。SAVVY是一种无需训练的两阶段推理方法，显著提升了AV-LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AV-LLMs和基准测试主要关注静态或2D场景，而动态3D空间推理尚未充分探索。

Method: SAVVY分为两阶段：1) 利用AV-LLMs和其他方法跟踪关键对象轨迹；2) 构建动态全局地图并通过坐标转换回答问题。

Result: SAVVY显著提升了现有AV-LLMs的性能，为动态3D空间推理设定了新标准。

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench和SAVVY方法填补了动态3D空间推理的空白，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Abstract: Violence Detection (VD) has become an increasingly vital area of research.
Existing automated VD efforts are hindered by the limited availability of
diverse, well-annotated databases. Existing databases suffer from coarse
video-level annotations, limited scale and diversity, and lack of metadata,
restricting the generalization of models. To address these challenges, we
introduce DVD, a large-scale (500 videos, 2.7M frames), frame-level annotated
VD database with diverse environments, varying lighting conditions, multiple
camera sources, complex social interactions, and rich metadata. DVD is designed
to capture the complexities of real-world violent events.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能实时准确估计和控制，无需真实状态。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了状态估计问题，并提供了评估学习状态准确性的定量方法。

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic
systems. However, obtaining true system states is often impractical or
infeasible, complicating the policy learning process. This paper introduces a
novel neural architecture that integrates spatial feature extraction using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporal modeling through gated
recurrent units (GRUs), enabling effective state representation from sequences
of images and corresponding actions. These learned state representations are
used to train a reinforcement learning agent with a Deep Q-Network (DQN).
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables real-time,
accurate estimation and control without direct access to ground-truth states.
Additionally, we provide a quantitative evaluation methodology for assessing
the accuracy of the learned states, highlighting their impact on policy
performance and control stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于InceptionResNetV2的判别网络，用于检测GAN生成的虚假图像和视频，旨在应对网络平台上虚假内容的泛滥问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假图像和视频的快速传播已成为严重问题，现有检测方法难以应对不断演变的伪造技术。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（基于InceptionResNetV2）构建独立判别网络，并开发了一个检测平台。

Result: 该方法能有效识别GAN生成的虚假内容，为法医领域提供技术支持。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于打击网络犯罪，识别隐藏的犯罪证据。

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the
forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence
towards the identification of criminal activities.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了ViT和ResNet在生物特征人脸认证中的公平性和泛化能力，提出了一种新的少样本原型网络，并在多个人口统计数据集上验证了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物特征人脸认证在不同人口统计群体中的公平性和泛化性问题。

Method: 结合ViT和ResNet的全局特征，设计少样本原型网络，并在自定义数据集上训练和测试。

Result: 微软的Swin Transformer表现最佳，性能随支持集大小增加而提升。

Conclusion: ViT和ResNet结合的方法在公平性和泛化性上表现良好，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and
data are available at: https://github.com/Sufianlab/FairVitBio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的两阶段训练框架，结合冷启动和强化学习微调，以同时优化视觉质量评估的评分准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和推理描述作为独立任务，导致评分准确性和可解释性之间的权衡，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动阶段通过专家设计的提示从教师模型蒸馏数据，强化学习阶段引入新奖励机制（GRPO）联合优化评分和推理一致性。

Result: Q-Ponder在质量评分回归基准上达到SOTA性能，跨域数据集SRCC提升6.5%，且在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于基于描述的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了评分与推理的权衡问题，展示了在多任务中的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriPSS是一种新型的三模态框架，通过融合颜色特征、深度结构嵌入和语义上下文，实现了高效的视频关键帧提取，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频关键帧提取在视频摘要和检索中至关重要，但现有方法难以全面捕捉视频内容的丰富性。

Method: TriPSS结合CIELAB空间颜色特征、ResNet-50的深度嵌入和Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct生成的语义上下文，通过PCA和多模态嵌入实现自适应视频分割。

Result: 在TVSum20和SumMe数据集上，TriPSS表现优于传统单模态和多模态方法，达到最新性能。

Conclusion: TriPSS通过多模态融合显著提升了视频内容理解的性能，为大规模检索场景设定了新标准。

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

Result: 在BIG、ThinObject5K和DIS5K三个基准测试中，Talk2SAM比SAM-HQ提升了5.9%的IoU和8.3%的边界IoU。

Conclusion: 自然语言引导为复杂物体的精确分割提供了灵活有效的方法，尤其在传统提示方法失败的情况下。

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive
reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image
captioning.

Motivation: 现有基于概念的神经网络解释存在概念不一致问题，且缺乏用户反馈机制，影响解释的可理解性。

Method: 提出YoursProtoP，通过用户监督调整和拆分视觉概念，使其更符合用户偏好和理解。

Result: 在FunnyBirds、CUB、CARS和PETS数据集上验证了YoursProtoP在保持模型准确性的同时实现概念一致性。

Conclusion: YoursProtoP有效解决了概念不一致问题，并通过用户交互提升了模型解释的可理解性。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

Result: 在Waymo和CODA数据集及真实车辆上测试，延迟最多降低57.58%，目标检测准确率最高提升44%。

Conclusion: AD-EE显著提升了VLMs在自动驾驶中的效率和准确性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual
information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify
process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and
an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment
workflows.

TL;DR: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏改进视觉预训练，解决了图像级自蒸馏在多对象场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉预训练方法假设每张图像仅含单一对象，限制了在复杂场景数据集上的扩展性。

Method: ODIS采用对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力，将自蒸馏粒度从图像级细化到对象级。

Result: ODIS在ViT-Large上实现了82.6%的ImageNet1k k-NN准确率。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏提升了视觉表示能力，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

TL;DR: 研究评估了111个视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视线推断任务中的表现，发现大多数模型表现不佳，而人类表现接近完美。少数表现较好的模型行为显示其可能依赖启发式方法而非随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视线推断是人类自然交互的关键能力，研究旨在评估VLMs是否具备类似能力以支持人机自然交互。

Method: 通过控制实验比较111个VLMs和65名人类参与者在不同难度和变异性照片中的表现，使用混合效应模型分析行为。

Result: 94个VLMs表现不如随机猜测，人类表现接近完美。少数表现较好的模型行为显示其可能依赖启发式方法，但受任务难度影响。

Conclusion: VLMs目前缺乏视线推断能力，但仍有潜力发展为支持自然交互的技术。

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

Motivation: CAD数据通常以STEP格式存储，需要昂贵的CAD内核处理，限制了其在机器学习中的大规模应用。

Method: 开发了基于HDF5的开放格式和配套Python库，支持数据查询和处理，并提供了标准功能（如采样、法线计算）。

Result: 成功转换了Fusion 360和ABC数据集，并通过四个标准用例验证了数据的完整性和兼容性。

Conclusion: 新格式和工具显著提升了CAD数据在机器学习中的可用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360
dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal
estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/unigary/SPD.

Result: 在GAPart数据集上验证了姿态估计能力，并在真实环境中实现了200Hz的实时反馈。

Conclusion: YOEO方法高效且实用，适用于实时机器人操作任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Result: 在DeepMind Control和Robosuite的复杂背景测试中，Dr. G分别比现有方法性能提升117%和14%。

Conclusion: Dr. G显著提升了MBRL在视觉干扰下的泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器数据的时间不同步（staleness）会导致物体状态估计不一致，严重影响轨迹预测的准确性，从而威胁自动驾驶的安全性。

Method: 方法包括：（1）为LiDAR和雷达数据引入相对于相机的时间戳偏移特征，实现细粒度的时间对齐；（2）通过数据增强模拟实际部署中的传感器staleness模式。

Result: 实验表明，传统方法在传感器数据不同步时性能显著下降，而新方法在同步和不同步条件下均能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法具有模型无关性，能有效解决传感器staleness问题，提升自动驾驶感知系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Conclusion: 模型高效轻量，性能优于现有方法，自监督学习增强了泛化能力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习（空间和时间）协同识别视频敏感区域，生成细微扰动。

Result: 在Lp指标和平均查询次数上优于现有方法，支持自定义失真类型。

Conclusion: 方法在HMDB-51和UCF-101数据集上验证了4种流行模型的鲁棒性评估效果。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Method: 使用三种基于CLIP的视觉语言模型，通过自注意力消融实验验证假设。

Result: CLIP视觉表示能提供语义信息，语言解码器可补偿其不足。

Conclusion: 未来架构可考虑将更多视觉处理任务分配给语言解码器。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Method: 引入结构化数据集NuScenes-S和轻量级模型FastDrive（0.9B参数），替代传统大模型（如LLaVA-1.5）。

Result: FastDrive在结构化数据集上性能提升20%，推理速度提升10倍。

Conclusion: 结构化数据和轻量模型显著提升自动驾驶决策效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote

learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在图像编辑中的广泛应用，识别真实图像中的篡改区域变得尤为重要，但现有方法难以应对新型扩散工具。

Method: RADAR结合多模态特征，引入辅助对比损失以隔离篡改区域，并在BBC-PAIR基准上测试。

Result: 实验表明，RADAR在检测和定位图像编辑方面优于现有方法，对已知和未知扩散模型均有效。

Conclusion: RADAR为图像篡改检测提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,
data and models will be publicly available at alex-costanzino.github.io/radar.

Motivation: 现有3D占用预测方法依赖密集表示，速度慢且缺乏灵活性，无法有效捕捉动态场景。

Method: 使用紧凑的3D查询集动态传播，解码为语义高斯，并结合去噪渲染目标优化查询。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI基准测试中，S2GO性能优于GaussianWorld，IoU提升1.5，推理速度快5.9倍。

Conclusion: 稀疏查询表示在3D场景预测中具有高效性和灵活性，优于传统密集表示方法。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and
diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image
Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing
5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the
dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory.
Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We
designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention.
This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and
feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and
attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human
cognition using neural network models.

Result: VR-INR在未见过的尺度和噪声条件下保持高质量重建，在清晰度、细节保留和去噪效果上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VR-INR展示了隐式神经表示在视频恢复中的强大泛化能力和灵活性。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Result: 在三个公开测试数据集上表现出色，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: F2T2-HiT架构在SIRR任务中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为复杂反射问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

Result: 该方法显著优于2D基线，证明了3D技术即使在动态场景中也能增强2D分析。

Conclusion: 3D技术可以通过结合2D分析和优化方法，有效处理动态现象，拓展其应用范围。

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在视觉模糊或非语义文本上容易产生语义幻觉，即生成看似合理但视觉错误的答案。

Method: 提出ZoomText（粗到细的文本区域识别）和Grounded Layer Correction（利用不易产生幻觉的层表示指导解码）。

Result: 方法有效减少语义幻觉，并在公开场景文本识别和理解基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架无需训练即可显著改善语义幻觉问题，同时保持对有意义样本的语义理解。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

Motivation: 现有方法在极端视角下存在几何不一致和边界遮挡问题，导致视觉质量下降。

Method: 采用深度水密网格表示建模可见和遮挡区域，提出模拟掩码策略生成训练数据，并使用LoRA适配器合成视频。

Result: 实验表明，EX-4D在物理一致性和极端视角质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EX-4D实现了实用的4D视频生成。

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如3DGS和SLAM在计算时间和处理大场景时存在局限性，需要一种能实时处理密集和宽基线拍摄的方法。

Method: 结合快速初始位姿估计（基于学习特征和GPU友好的小束调整）和直接采样高斯基元位置与形状，增量生成基元，并通过渐进聚类和锚点存储处理大场景。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证，能够实时处理目标场景，且在速度、图像质量或两者上与其他方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了实时位姿估计和3DGS训练，适用于大场景和宽基线拍摄，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

Conclusion: VoxelSplat能无缝集成到现有模型中，提升性能且不增加推理时间。

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

TL;DR: PartCrafter是一个结构化3D生成模型，能够从单张RGB图像联合生成多个语义明确且几何上独立的3D网格。它采用统一的组合生成架构，无需预分割输入，并通过分层注意力机制实现全局一致性和局部细节保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么生成单一3D形状，要么采用两阶段流程（先分割图像再重建每个部分），无法实现端到端的部分感知生成。PartCrafter旨在解决这一问题，通过联合生成多个3D部分，提升3D理解和合成的能力。

Method: PartCrafter基于预训练的3D网格扩散变换器（DiT），引入组合潜在空间和分层注意力机制。每个3D部分由解耦的潜在令牌表示，并通过注意力机制实现部分内和部分间的信息流动。

Result: 实验表明，PartCrafter在生成可分解3D网格方面优于现有方法，包括生成输入图像中不可见的部分。

Conclusion: PartCrafter展示了部分感知生成先验在3D理解和合成中的优势，代码和训练数据将公开。

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

Motivation: 真实世界图像恢复面临多种退化问题，现有方法难以泛化到野外数据。本文聚焦于复杂退化（多种已知退化的混合），提出了一种灵活的解决方案。

Method: 提出UniRes框架，结合多个专用模型在扩散采样步骤中，利用孤立训练数据实现复杂退化恢复，支持灵活扩展和调整保真度-质量权衡。

Result: 在复杂退化和单一退化数据集上均表现优异，尤其在复杂退化图像上性能提升显著。

Conclusion: UniRes为复杂退化图像恢复提供了有效且灵活的解决方案，支持未来扩展。

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在所有退化任务中均表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法通过协调任务定义、不平衡量化和数据再平衡，显著提升了真实图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

Motivation: 固定谓词集的视觉关系检测模型难以泛化到新交互关系，且无法视觉接地外部知识假设的语义合理关系。

Method: 采用期望最大化（EM）启发的方法，交替使用LLM生成候选场景图（期望步骤）和训练视觉模型对齐感知证据（最大化步骤）。

Result: 在Visual Genome的新基准测试中，模型在seen、unseen和mixed三种设置下的平均召回率（mR@50）分别为15.9、13.1和11.7，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的视觉接地框架为开放世界视觉理解提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最先进性能，且计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: ADR-MVS有效解决了航拍图像的多视角立体视觉问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical

subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level

these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without

with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent
reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is
vital for robust progress in the field.

Result: 实验表明，显式的道德监督提升了单模态和多模态对道德内容的理解能力。

Conclusion: MoralCLIP为构建具有道德意识的AI系统奠定了基础，能够识别并与人类道德价值观对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

### [61] [Investigating the Relationship between Weighted Figure of Merit and Rosin's Measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05749)
*Bimal Kumar Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了加权图形优度与Rosin度量之间的关系，发现两者理论无关，实验和统计分析支持这一结论，表明不能互相替代。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多边形近似评估中Rosin度量计算耗时的问题，探索加权图形优度是否可作为替代。

Method: 通过理论分析、实验验证和统计方法（如Pearson相关系数）研究两种度量的关系。

Result: 理论证明和实验数据均表明加权图形优度与Rosin度量无关，无法互相替代。

Conclusion: 加权图形优度不能替代Rosin度量，两者评估结果不一致。

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

Abstract: We present a method for 3D ball trajectory estimation from a 2D tracking
sequence. To overcome the ambiguity in 3D from 2D estimation, we design an
LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is
independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of
intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection
consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets
and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite
training solely on simulated data, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and can generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple
trajectories, opening up a range of applications in sport analysis and virtual
replay. Please visit our page: https://where-is-the-ball.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否像人类一样容易受到视觉错觉的影响，并引入了一个新的视觉问答数据集（VQA）来区分真实和虚假错觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类容易受到光学错觉的影响，这为研究感知和认知过程提供了工具。研究旨在探索机器（如LVLMs）是否表现出类似的错觉敏感性。

Method: 通过构建一个包含真实和虚假错觉的VQA数据集，评估LVLMs对两种错觉的识别能力。

Result: LVLMs虽然能正确回答关于两种错觉的问题，但对真实和虚假错觉的回答相同，表明其可能依赖先验知识而非真实视觉理解。

Conclusion: LVLMs的错觉识别可能基于先验知识而非视觉理解，数据集为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ)
Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's
perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that

cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which
leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language
queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining
strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to
augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing
localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves
R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

Result: 在四个3D血管分割数据集上的实验表明，DeformCL在效果和性能上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: DeformCL不仅提升了血管提取的准确性，还具有临床意义，代码已开源。

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统UNet的跳跃连接存在两个主要问题：不同尺度特征间缺乏有效交互，以及简单的拼接或加法操作限制了信息整合。

Method: 将解码过程建模为初始值问题，利用线性多步方法提出自适应常微分方程方法，实现多尺度特征融合。

Result: 在多个医学图像分割数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提高了特征利用率并减少了网络参数，同时保持了高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法独立于编码器和解码器架构，适用于各种UNet类网络，为医学图像分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

Result: DIF滤波器在1280x720分辨率下吞吐量达403.39 MEPS，640x480分辨率下为428.45 MEPS，AUROC指数为0.844-0.999，性能优于现有方案。

Conclusion: DIF滤波器在高效去噪和高吞吐量方面表现优异，适用于多种噪声水平。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

Motivation: 现有方法对预设字体外的适配计算成本高，难以实时定制，FontAdapter旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习：先提取字体属性，再整合到自然背景中，并构建合成数据集支持训练。

Result: FontAdapter无需额外微调即可高质量适配未见字体，支持多种字体定制任务。

Conclusion: FontAdapter是一个高效、多功能的字体定制框架。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence

the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object

Method: ChronoTailor采用区域感知空间引导和注意力驱动的时序特征融合机制，结合多尺度服装特征和姿态对齐，确保时空连续性和细节保留。

Result: 实验表明，ChronoTailor在时空连续性和服装细节保留方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChronoTailor通过创新的框架设计，有效解决了视频虚拟试穿中的连续性和细节问题，并提供了新的数据集支持研究。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Method: 使用SPAT设备的32张图像，结合神经网络分割和算法检测，手动标注10,416个风团。

Result: 在217名患者的验证集上，多光照图像比单光照图像显著提高了检测准确性。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出Domain-RAG框架，通过检索引导的合成图像生成解决跨域少样本目标检测问题，无需额外训练即可生成高质量样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域少样本目标检测（CD-FSOD）需要从新域中检测少量样本，现有数据增强和生成方法因视觉真实性和域对齐问题效果不佳。

Method: Domain-RAG框架包含三阶段：域感知背景检索、域引导背景生成、前景-背景合成，生成高质量域对齐样本。

Result: 实验表明Domain-RAG在CD-FSOD等任务中优于基线方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: Domain-RAG为跨域少样本目标检测提供了一种无需训练的生成高质量样本的有效方法。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow

five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025

Motivation: 现有方法在探索局部内容的细粒度一致性方面表现不足，导致对篡改细节的感知不充分和结果不可靠。

Method: 建立了图像和文本模态的两个分支，每个分支包含两个级联解码器（CCD和SCD），分别捕捉模态内上下文一致性和跨模态语义一致性。

Result: 在DGM4数据集上的实验表明，CSCL取得了最先进的性能，尤其是在定位篡改内容方面。

Conclusion: CSCL通过细粒度一致性学习显著提升了多模态篡改检测的性能。

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床应用中至关重要，但传统方法对小器官分割效果不佳，且Transformer模型训练成本高。

Method: 结合Mask2Former与可变形注意力，提出偏移调整策略和辅助头，利用第4特征图提供器官粗定位。

Result: 在HaNSeg和SegRap2023数据集上达到SOTA性能，尤其在小器官分割上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了小器官分割问题，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标RSS，用于综合衡量半监督语义分割模型的准确性、可靠性和鲁棒性，填补了当前评估协议的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督分割模型的评估仅关注准确性，忽略了可靠性和鲁棒性，而这两者对安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）至关重要。

Method: 引入Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS)，通过调和平均值结合预测准确性、校准性和不确定性质量，全面评估模型。

Result: 实验表明，半监督方法（如UniMatchV2）在准确性上表现良好，但在可靠性和鲁棒性上仍有不足。

Conclusion: 呼吁采用更全面的评估指标（如RSS），以更好地满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

Motivation: 现有图像扩散模型难以处理视频动态编辑，而视频扩散模型虽能生成高质量结果，但直接应用图像编辑技术计算成本高。

Method: 通过分析视频模型中的注意力模式，提出频率感知分解策略优化组件角色，并结合频谱引导调制细化采样轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，FADE能生成高质量、真实且时间一致的编辑结果。

Conclusion: FADE是一种高效、通用的视频编辑方法，无需额外训练即可实现高质量编辑。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

Conclusion: MOGO在高效实时运动生成方面具有显著优势，为文本到运动生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF或3D高斯点云的SLAM方法在动态环境中表现不佳，且多数依赖RGB-D输入，缺乏纯RGB输入的解决方案。

Method: 提出Dy3DGS-SLAM，融合光流和深度掩码生成动态掩码，设计运动损失约束位姿估计，利用渲染损失消除动态干扰。

Result: 实验表明Dy3DGS-SLAM在动态环境中跟踪与渲染性能优于或匹配现有RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM为动态场景SLAM提供了高效的单目RGB解决方案，性能优越。

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

Motivation: 现有CAPTCHA方案缺乏统一的大规模多模态基准测试，无法全面评估其安全性。

Method: 通过共享的视觉-语言模型骨干，为每种CAPTCHA类别微调专门的破解代理，实现跨模态评估。

Result: MCA-Bench有效映射了现代CAPTCHA设计的漏洞谱，并首次定量分析了挑战复杂性、交互深度和模型可解性的关系。

Conclusion: 提出了三项可操作的设计原则和关键开放挑战，为CAPTCHA加固、公平基准测试和社区合作奠定了基础。

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

Result: 最佳模型在Aurora-Bench上的动作中心图像编辑任务中表现优异，优于现有模型15%，并在人类评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 动态模型可以有效地引导世界模型，提升模型在现实任务中的表现。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

Conclusion: 研究表明，在扩散净化方法中为不同样本分配不同的噪声水平是必要的，SSNI框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: HAVIR是一种通过结合AutoKL和CLIP适配器的方法，从fMRI数据中重建复杂视觉刺激的图像，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从fMRI数据中准确重建复杂视觉刺激的挑战，包括元素密度、多样性和语义信息。

Method: HAVIR包含两个适配器：AutoKL适配器（捕捉拓扑结构）和CLIP适配器（提取语义信息），通过Versatile Diffusion融合生成图像。

Result: 实验表明HAVIR能有效重建复杂场景中的结构特征和语义信息，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR通过结合拓扑和语义信息，成功解决了复杂视觉刺激的重建问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于“角树”数学工具的新型张量到张量层（FIS层），其计算成本与输入大小呈线性关系，适用于图像和高阶张量数据处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习应用中，图像和高阶张量数据的高维度特性需要次二次方的处理层，而现有方法难以满足这一需求。

Method: 利用“角树”数学工具，提出了一种线性成本的张量到张量层，并将其应用于图像处理任务中。

Result: 在分类和异常检测任务中，FIS层表现优异，替换部分ResNet层后，性能接近更大模型（准确率仅差0.1%），同时减少了参数和计算量。异常检测模型在MVTec AD数据集上平均AUROC达97.3%。

Conclusion: FIS层是一种高效且通用的张量处理工具，能够显著降低计算成本并保持高性能。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法忽视浅层与深层特征的异质性，导致多级特征协作不足，影响检测性能和计算效率。

Method: 采用双分支架构分别建模结构特征和语义特征，并引入自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征相关性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持低计算复杂性和高推理效率。

Conclusion: SDS-Net在红外小目标检测中展现出优越性能和广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中表现出强大的判别能力，但其可靠性问题尚未得到充分研究。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 研究采用分割一致性预测（SCP）框架，并提出全适应一致性框架和SS-Text方法，通过少量样本适应集进行联合适应和一致性调整。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在保持相同覆盖保证的同时，将集合效率提高了27%。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中的可靠性和效率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小麦管理依赖人工专家检查，成本高且难以扩展，而现有视觉语言模型因缺乏领域知识导致性能不佳。

Method: 设计WisWheat数据集，包含预训练、定量测量和指令微调三层数据，用于微调开源视觉语言模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在小麦压力和生长阶段任务中分别达到79.2%和84.6%的准确率，显著优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: WisWheat数据集有效提升了视觉语言模型在小麦管理任务中的性能，为农业智能化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）擅长分析短视频，但在长视频理解上表现不佳，主要因为缺乏对镜头结构的深入理解。

Method: 提出 VideoChat-A1，采用链式镜头推理范式，逐步选择相关镜头并进行粗到细的分区多模态推理。

Result: 在主流长视频 QA 基准测试中表现优异，如 VideoMME（77.0）和 EgoSchema（70.1），显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1 通过模仿人类思维过程，在长视频理解中实现了高效且准确的性能。

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

Motivation: 传统帧相机在极低光条件下因动态范围和时间分辨率限制导致图像细节丢失和运动模糊，现有事件相机方法忽视全局低频噪声和局部结构不连续性问题。

Method: 提出BiLIE框架，包含基于频率高通滤波的事件特征增强（EFE）模块和双向交叉注意力融合（BCAF）机制，同时引入新数据集RELIE。

Result: BiLIE在PSNR和LPIPS指标上分别优于现有方法0.96dB和0.03。

Conclusion: BiLIE有效解决了低光图像增强中的噪声和结构问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

Result: CCLSTM在占用流指标上达到SOTA性能，并在2024 Waymo挑战赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: CCLSTM是一种高效且实用的解决方案，适用于自动驾驶中的未来状态预测任务。

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy

Method: 提出CLaMR，联合编码视频帧、语音、屏幕文本和元数据，并引入MultiVENT 2.0++数据集和模态感知损失函数进行训练。

Result: 在MultiVENT 2.0++和MSRVTT测试集上，CLaMR显著优于基线方法，nDCG@10提升25.6（单模态）和35.4（多模态）。

Conclusion: CLaMR在多模态视频检索中表现优异，下游任务（如长视频QA）中也有显著提升。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: 该方法为细粒度作物分类和高光谱图像处理提供了重要基准，并展示了高光谱数据的持续优势。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time

previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online

(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large

HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that

for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios

multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GenIR的生成式多轮检索方法，用于解决心理图像检索（MIR）任务，通过扩散模型生成视觉反馈，显著提升了交互式检索的效果。

Result: 实验表明，GenIR在多轮MIR任务中显著优于现有交互式方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为心理图像检索任务提供了新的数据集和生成式检索方法，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在内窥镜手术任务中的能力，填补传统计算机视觉模型在该领域的不足。

Method: 使用多种先进VLMs、多个手术数据集和人工标注，评估其在基础感知和高级场景理解任务中的表现。

Result: VLMs在基础任务（如目标计数和定位）上表现良好，但在医学知识任务中表现不佳；专业医学VLMs表现不如通用模型。

Conclusion: 需进一步优化VLMs以适应手术环境的复杂性，为下一代内窥镜AI系统提供方向。

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Motivation: 在PB级地球观测数据上训练深度学习模型时，标准PyTorch数据加载器无法充分利用现代GPU，导致效率低下。

Method: 通过系统测试不同加载配置和数据参数，使用贝叶斯优化找到最优设置，重点关注瓦片对齐读取和线程池。

Result: 优化后的配置使远程数据加载速度提升20倍，本地速度提升4倍，模型训练精度与本地训练相当，GPU利用率显著提高。

Conclusion: 优化数据加载配置可显著提升地球观测数据训练效率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization
versus 0-30% with standard configurations. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在视觉概念推理（如识别和推理同一概念的不同视觉形式）上的能力不足问题。

Method: 提出VGA数据集，包含六种基于图的任务，测试AI系统在不同视觉布局下的推理能力。

Result: 实验显示人类表现近乎完美，而AI模型在部分任务上完全失败，行为异常表明其依赖模式匹配而非真正理解。

Conclusion: VGA为提升AI视觉模型的类人概念化能力提供了框架，揭示了当前模型的根本局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

Conclusion: BecomingLit在重照明和动画控制方面表现出色，为高质量虚拟形象提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable,
high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at
interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture
setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we
collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous
subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By
leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar
representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a
parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a
new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our
avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars
can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our
approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a
significant margin.

<details>

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在长视频内容理解方面存在挑战，现有基准测试要么关注细节，要么依赖半自动生成的问题，未能反映真实理解。

Method: MF$^2$包含50多部开放许可的全长电影，每部电影配对手工构建的真假声明对，共850多对，评估模型对核心叙事元素的理解。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在识别真假声明对的任务上远低于人类表现，突显了当前VLMs在叙事信息理解和推理能力上的不足。

Conclusion: MF$^2$为评估模型对长视频内容的深度理解提供了新基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Motivation: 解决归一化流在高分辨率图像合成中的可扩展性和性能问题，结合归一化流的表达能力和Transformer的结构化建模能力。

Method: 提出TARFlow，结合归一化流和自回归Transformer；采用深度-浅层设计、潜在空间建模和新型引导算法。

Result: 在类条件和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，接近扩散模型的样本质量。

Conclusion: STARFlow首次证明归一化流在大规模高分辨率图像生成中的有效性。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities
in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct
requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed
candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level
understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art
VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert
performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only
44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human

Result: 在七个基准测试中表现优于传统LVLM架构，包括长上下文理解、多图像推理和视觉问答。

Conclusion: CoMemo和RoPE-DHR有效解决了视觉信息忽略和2D空间关系维护问题，提升了多模态处理性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench
and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Motivation: 解决野外活动（尤其是体育领域）数据不足的问题，现有合成数据方法因依赖固定资产库和手工渲染流程而缺乏多样性。

Method: Gen4D整合了专家驱动的运动编码、扩散基高斯泼溅的提示引导虚拟人生成和人类感知背景合成，自动化生成多样化4D动画。

Conclusion: Gen4D和SportPAL为无需手工建模的场景提供了高效、多样化的合成数据解决方案。

Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low
performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is
particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where
real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets
offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from
limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to
their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines.
To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating
diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven
motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian
splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and
lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale
synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer.
Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing
synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no
need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve realistic outcomes across a wide range of generative
tasks, but their high computational cost remains a major barrier to deployment.
Model pruning has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce inference cost and
enable lightweight diffusion models. While effective, pruned diffusion models
are proned to quality reduction due to limited capacity. A key limitation of
current pruning approaches is that pruned models are finetuned using the same
objective as the dense model, typically denoising score matching (DSM). Since
the dense model is accessible during finetuning, it warrants a more effective
approach for knowledge transfer from the dense to the pruned model. Motivated
by this aim, we revisit the finetuning stage and propose IGSM
(\textbf{I}mproved \textbf{G}eometric and \textbf{S}ensitivity
\textbf{M}atching), a general-purpose finetuning framework that introduces a
second-order Jacobian projection loss inspired by Finite-Time Lyapunov
Exponents (FTLE). IGSM efficiently captures and aligns the geometric and the
temporal dynamics of pruned models with their dense teachers using scalable
second-order projections. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and applies to
both U-Net- and Transformer-based diffusion models. Experiments on CIFAR-10,
CelebA, LSUN-Church, and LSUN-Bedroom show that IGSM consistently narrows the
performance gap between pruned and dense models, substantially improving sample
quality. Code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/FATE4869/IGSM-Official

models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for
assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into
their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the current landscape and serve as a foundation for future
research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced
generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high
computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like
cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the
quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation
metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation.

*Daniel Wang,Patrick Rim,Tian Tian,Alex Wong,Ganesh Sundaramoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ODE-GS结合3D高斯泼溅与潜在神经ODE，预测动态3D场景，超越训练时间范围，实现高质量外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染系统（如NeRF或3DGS）在时间外推时表现不佳，ODE-GS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 冻结时间条件变形模型，用Transformer编码器总结高斯轨迹，通过神经ODE控制潜在状态演化，实现未来时刻查询。

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准测试中，PSNR提升10 dB，LPIPS减半，达到SOTA外推性能。

Conclusion: 连续时间潜在动力学是实现复杂3D场景真实预测的有效途径。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

Motivation: 解决多光源直接光照在实时渲染中的挑战。

Method: 采用多层感知机（MLP）和多分辨率哈希网格编码实现神经缓存，支持在线训练和高效推理。

Result: 方法可无缝集成现有渲染框架，并与其他实时技术（如ReSTIR）结合使用。

Conclusion: 神经缓存为实时渲染中的多光源光照问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of
physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time
scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility
between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir
sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a
fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid
encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in
real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing
rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time
techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SurGSplat是一种通过几何约束逐步优化3D高斯泼溅的新方法，用于解决内窥镜场景中稀疏特征和光照不一致导致的3D重建问题，显著提升了手术导航的精度和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜手术场景中的稀疏特征和不一致光照使现有基于运动恢复结构（SfM）的方法难以实现精确3D重建，亟需一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出SurGSplat，通过逐步优化3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）并结合几何约束，实现对血管结构等关键特征的详细重建。

Result: 实验表明，SurGSplat在新视角合成（NVS）和姿态估计精度上表现优异，为手术场景提供了高保真且高效的3D重建方案。

Conclusion: SurGSplat为内窥镜手术导航提供了一种高精度、高可靠性的3D重建方法，显著提升了手术决策的精确性。

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to
ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic
scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent
lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods
inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints,
we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By
enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view
synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a
high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More

Motivation: 现有方法在高动态范围块压缩格式下效果有限，作者希望证明低动态范围格式仍可行，并优化性能。

Method: 结合块压缩方法和硬件纹理过滤，存储神经表示的PBR纹理集，采用基于瓦片的渲染架构利用硬件矩阵乘法引擎。

Result: 在Intel B580上，以28MB VRAM和0.55ms渲染4k纹理集（9通道），支持各向异性过滤。

Conclusion: 低动态范围块压缩格式在神经纹理压缩中可行，且能显著提升压缩比或质量，同时优化运行时性能。

Abstract: In this work, we present an extension to the neural texture compression
method of Weinreich and colleagues [2024]. Like them, we leverage existing
block compression methods which permit to use hardware texture filtering to
store a neural representation of physically-based rendering (PBR) texture sets
(including albedo, normal maps, roughness, etc.). However, we show that low
dynamic range block compression formats still make the solution viable. Thanks
to this, we show that we can achieve higher compression ratio or higher quality
at fixed compression ratio. We improve performance at runtime using a tile
based rendering architecture that leverage hardware matrix multiplication
engine. Thanks to all this, we render 4k textures sets (9 channels per asset)
with anisotropic filtering at 1080p using only 28MB of VRAM per texture set at
0.55ms on an Intel B580.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交媒体平台中算法如何通过设定曝光和奖励规则影响内容创作者的行为，尤其是合作与冲突策略。

Method: 采用Stackelberg博弈模型，算法为领导者，创作者为跟随者，间接建模观众偏好。

Result: 模型显示不同算法优先级会改变创作者策略，揭示了社交媒体影响力的均衡动态。

Conclusion: 博弈模型为理解算法与创作者互动提供了理论框架，揭示了策略选择的经济动机。

Abstract: Social media platforms are ecosystems in which many decisions are constantly
made for the benefit of the creators in order to maximize engagement, which
leads to a maximization of income. The decisions, ranging from collaboration to
public conflict or ``beefing,'' are heavily influenced by social media
algorithms, viewer preferences, and sponsor risk. This paper models this
interaction as a Stackelberg game in which the algorithm is the leader, setting
exposure and reward rules, and the content creators are the followers, who
optimize their content to maximize engagement. It focuses on two influencer
strategies of collaborating and beefing. Viewer preferences are modeled
indirectly through the algorithm's utility function, which rewards engagement
metrics like click-through rate and watch time. Our simplified game-theoretic
model demonstrates how different algorithmic priorities can shift creator
strategies and provides insight into the equilibrium dynamics of social media
influence.

<details>

Motivation: 现有数据采购方法依赖不可验证的信任或忽略提供者成本异质性，无法满足法律、隐私和战略约束下的高质量数据需求。

Method: 提出Q-MIA拍卖机制，基于数据质量和学习效用排名提供者，并使用Myerson支付确保激励兼容和预算平衡；引入MUT代币支持长期激励；最终结合为Mixed-MIA混合机制。

Result: 理论和实验表明，这些机制在预算约束下能激发更高质量数据，且对误报和共谋具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为未来大语言模型的数据市场建立了可持续且公平的原则性基础。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality
data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints.
Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore
heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for
truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive
compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while
rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model
where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises
solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we
propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks
providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure
DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or
long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which
allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in
Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards.
All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation.
Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based
baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while
remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled
foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.

Motivation: 研究子加性代理的公平分配问题，填补现有研究中子加性代理的边界不足。

Conclusion: 新方法对子加性估值有独立意义，未来可应用于其他研究。

Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of indivisible goods for subadditive
agents. While constant-\textsf{MMS} bounds have been given for additive and
fractionally subadditive agents, the best existential bound for the case of
subadditive agents is $1/O(\log n \log \log n)$. In this work, we improve this
bound to a $1/O((\log \log n)^2)$-\textsf{MMS} guarantee. To this end, we
introduce new matching techniques and rounding methods for subadditive

applications in future work.

Result: 对XOS函数，提出常数近似最优解的多项式时间算法，并开发了针对子加性函数的近似需求查询方法。

Conclusion: 为更复杂的组合合同设计问题提供了理论基础和算法支持。

Abstract: We study a new class of contract design problems where a principal delegates
the execution of multiple projects to a set of agents. The principal's expected
reward from each project is a combinatorial function of the agents working on
it. Each agent has limited capacity and can work on at most one project, and
the agents are heterogeneous, with different costs and contributions for
participating in different projects. The main challenge of the principal is to
decide how to allocate the agents to projects when the number of projects grows
in scale.
  We analyze this problem under different assumptions on the structure of the
expected reward functions. As our main result, for XOS functions we show how to
derive a constant approximation to the optimal multi-project contract in
polynomial time, given access to value and demand oracles. Along the way (and
of possible independent interest), we develop approximate demand queries for
\emph{capped} subadditive functions, by reducing to demand queries for the
original functions. Our work paves the way to combinatorial contract design in
richer settings.

Conclusion: 讨价还价视角为长期说服提供了高效且公平的解决方案，扩展了传统贝叶斯说服的应用范围。

Abstract: Bayesian persuasion, an extension of cheap-talk communication, involves an
informed sender committing to a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's
actions. Compared to cheap talk, this sender's commitment enables the receiver
to verify the incentive compatibility of signals beforehand, facilitating
cooperation. While effective in one-shot scenarios, Bayesian persuasion faces
computational complexity (NP-hardness) when extended to long-term interactions,
where the receiver may adopt dynamic strategies conditional on past outcomes
and future expectations. To address this complexity, we introduce the
bargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and
well-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable
properties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction
between two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational
advantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the
standard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the
game structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities,
thereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information
bargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage
validation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and
DeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We
then apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with
what our information-bargaining framework suggests. All code, results, and
terminal logs are publicly available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法为能源市场的高效管理提供了可行方案，通过微电网联盟优化平衡供需动态。

Abstract: With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution
networks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy
market has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may
face imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability
at the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal
coalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or
supply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient
management of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that
identify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of
the energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the
optimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a
strategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An
individual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of
population of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and
mutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total
value generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when
the energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the
energy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the
profit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during
periods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy
on the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the
trading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members,
according to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to
the formation of collective value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的匹配市场通常规模庞大，代理难以提供完整的偏好列表，因此需要研究不完整列表对匹配结果的影响。

Method: 采用序列独裁机制模型，假设学生偏好列表长度为d，随机从n所学校中均匀采样，每所学校有一个席位。

Result: 当学生更关心是否被匹配而非具体排名时，较长的偏好列表对所有学生和学校更有利。

Conclusion: 在需求不超过供给的市场中，应设计尽可能长的偏好列表以优化匹配结果。

Abstract: Many centralized mechanisms for two-sided matching markets that enjoy strong
theoretical properties assume that the planner solicits full information on the
preferences of each participating agent. In particular, they expect that
participants compile and communicate their complete preference lists over
agents from the other side of the market. However, real-world markets are often
very large and agents cannot always be expected to even produce a ranking of
all options on the other side. It is therefore important to understand the
impact of incomplete or truncated lists on the quality of the resultant
matching.
  In this paper, we focus on the Serial Dictatorship mechanism in a model where
each agent of the proposing side (students) has a random preference list of
length $d$, sampled independently and uniformly at random from $n$ schools,
each of which has one seat. Our main result shows that if the students
primarily care about being matched to any school of their list (as opposed to
ending up unmatched), then all students in position $i\leq n$ will prefer
markets with longer lists, when $n$ is large enough. Schools on the other hand
will always prefer longer lists in our model. We moreover investigate the
impact of $d$ on the rank of the school that a student gets matched to.
  Our main result suggests that markets that are well-approximated by our
hypothesis and where the demand of schools does not exceed supply should be
designed with preference lists as long as reasonable, since longer lists would
favor all agents.

Result: 证明了归约的正确性，并在二进制编码下验证了其多项式时间复杂度，支持了SPG的NP∩coNP复杂性。

Conclusion: 该研究为随机博弈中奇偶目标与可达目标的关系提供了新的理解。

Abstract: Significant progress has been recently achieved in developing efficient
solutions for simple stochastic games (SSGs), focusing on reachability
objectives. While reductions from stochastic parity games (SPGs) to SSGs have
been presented in the literature through the use of multiple intermediate game
models, a direct and simple reduction has been notably absent. This paper
introduces a novel and direct polynomial-time reduction from quantitative SPGs
to quantitative SSGs. By leveraging a gadget-based transformation that
effectively removes the priority function, we construct an SSG that simulates
the behavior of a given SPG. We formally establish the correctness of our
direct reduction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under binary encoding this
reduction is polynomial, thereby directly corroborating the known
$\textbf{NP}\,\mathbf{\cap}\,\textbf{coNP}$ complexity of SPGs and providing
new understanding in the relationship between parity and reachability
objectives in turn-based stochastic games.

Result: 深度神经网络模型在理解学生反馈的情感背景方面表现出更高的效能。

Conclusion: 通过情感分析技术，研究为在线教育中的师生沟通提供了新的解决方案，有望提升教育质量。

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,
and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding,
LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This model is compared against a logistic
regression baseline to evaluate its efficacy in understanding student feedback.
The study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students
in online learning environments, offering insights into the emotional context
of student feedback and ultimately improving the quality of online education.

Abstract: Scenario building is an established method to anticipate the future of
emerging technologies. Its primary goal is to use narratives to map future
trajectories of technology development and sociotechnical adoption. Following
this process, risks and benefits can be identified early on, and strategies can
be developed that strive for desirable futures. In recent years, computer
science has adopted this method and applied it to various technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because computing technologies play
such an important role in shaping modern societies, it is worth exploring how
scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field -- and what
possible traditional uses of scenarios are not yet covered but have the
potential to enrich the field. We address this gap by conducting a systematic
literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science
over the last decade (n = 59). We guide the review along two main questions.
First, we aim to uncover how scenarios are used in computing literature,
focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used. Second, in
following the potential of scenario building to enhance inclusivity in
research, we dive deeper into the participatory element of the existing
scenario building literature in computer science.

Abstract: We present a customizable soft haptic system that integrates modular hardware
with an information-theoretic algorithm to personalize feedback for different
users and tasks. Our platform features modular, multi-degree-of-freedom
pneumatic displays, where different signal types, such as pressure, frequency,
and contact area, can be activated or combined using fluidic logic circuits.
These circuits simplify control by reducing reliance on specialized electronics
and enabling coordinated actuation of multiple haptic elements through a
compact set of inputs. Our approach allows rapid reconfiguration of haptic
signal rendering through hardware-level logic switching without rewriting code.
Personalization of the haptic interface is achieved through the combination of
modular hardware and software-driven signal selection. To determine which
display configurations will be most effective, we model haptic communication as
a signal transmission problem, where an agent must convey latent information to
the user. We formulate the optimization problem to identify the haptic hardware
setup that maximizes the information transfer between the intended message and
the user's interpretation, accounting for individual differences in
sensitivity, preferences, and perceptual salience. We evaluate this framework
through user studies where participants interact with reconfigurable displays
under different signal combinations. Our findings support the role of
modularity and personalization in creating multimodal haptic interfaces and
advance the development of reconfigurable systems that adapt with users in
dynamic human-machine interaction contexts.

Method: 采用用户中心迭代设计方法，从低技术灯光盒到数字屏幕，分三个阶段与MCI老年人及其护理伙伴合作。

Result: 研究总结了三种关键情境（常规、实时和特定情境），并提出了针对性的辅助设计策略。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发个性化、情境感知的备餐辅助技术提供了实用指导，同时强调尊重老年人与护理伙伴的合作关系。

Abstract: Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often face challenges
during meal preparation, such as forgetting ingredients, skipping steps, or
leaving appliances on, which can compromise their safety and independence. Our
study explores the design of context-aware assistive technologies for meal
preparation using a user-centered iterative design process. Through three
iterative phases of design and feedback, evolving from low-tech lightbox to a
digital screen, we gained insights into managing diverse contexts and
personalizing assistance through collaboration with older adults with MCI and
their care partners. We concluded our findings in three key
contexts--routine-based, real-time, and situational--that informed strategies
for designing context-aware meal prep assistance tailored to users' needs. Our
results provide actionable insights for creating technologies to assist meal
preparation that are personalized for the unique lifestyles of older adults
with MCI, situated in the complex and dynamic homebound context, and respecting
the collaboration between older adults and their care partners.

### [134] [What Comes After Harm? Mapping Reparative Actions in AI through Justice Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05687)
*Sijia Xiao,Haodi Zou,Alice Qian Zhang,Deepak Kumar,Hong Shen,Jason Hong,Motahhare Eslami*

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI系统对社会造成的危害及其修复问题，提出了一个基于现实事件的AI危害修复分类法，并分析了现有修复措施的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在社会中的广泛应用，其带来的危害日益受到关注，但关于危害发生后的修复措施研究较少。

Method: 通过主题分析现实事件，构建了AI危害修复的分类法，并将其应用于1,060起AI相关事件的数据库。

Result: 研究发现修复措施主要集中在象征性阶段，缺乏问责或结构性改革。

Conclusion: 现有修复措施未能提供实质性补救，为推进更负责任的AI修复方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are integrated into more aspects of
society, they offer new capabilities but also cause a range of harms that are
drawing increasing scrutiny. A large body of work in the Responsible AI
community has focused on identifying and auditing these harms. However, much
less is understood about what happens after harm occurs: what constitutes
reparation, who initiates it, and how effective these reparations are. In this
paper, we develop a taxonomy of AI harm reparation based on a thematic analysis
of real-world incidents. The taxonomy organizes reparative actions into four
overarching goals: acknowledging harm, attributing responsibility, providing
remedies, and enabling systemic change. We apply this framework to a dataset of
1,060 AI-related incidents, analyzing the prevalence of each action and the
distribution of stakeholder involvement. Our findings show that reparation
efforts are concentrated in early, symbolic stages, with limited actions toward
accountability or structural reform. Drawing on theories of justice, we argue
that existing responses fall short of delivering meaningful redress. This work
contributes a foundation for advancing more accountable and reparative
approaches to Responsible AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耳戴设备正从音频配件发展为多功能系统，研究兴趣激增，需全面梳理最新进展。

Method: 分析100多项近期研究，评估研究趋势、资源及进展。

Result: 发现新型传感原理、应用提升，资源丰富，但仍存挑战。

Conclusion: 耳戴技术是普适计算的前沿，未来需解决开放挑战并探索新方向。

Abstract: Earable devices, wearables positioned in or around the ear, are undergoing a
rapid transformation from audio-centric accessories into multifunctional
systems for interaction, contextual awareness, and health monitoring. This
evolution is driven by commercial trends emphasizing sensor integration and by
a surge of academic interest exploring novel sensing capabilities. Building on
the foundation established by earlier surveys, this work presents a timely and
comprehensive review of earable research published since 2022. We analyze over
one hundred recent studies to characterize this shifting research landscape,
identify emerging applications and sensing modalities, and assess progress
relative to prior efforts. In doing so, we address three core questions: how
has earable research evolved in recent years, what enabling resources are now
available, and what opportunities remain for future exploration. Through this
survey, we aim to provide both a retrospective and forward-looking view of
earable technology as a rapidly expanding frontier in ubiquitous computing. In
particular, this review reveals that over the past three years, researchers
have discovered a variety of novel sensing principles, developed many new
earable sensing applications, enhanced the accuracy of existing sensing tasks,
and created substantial new resources to advance research in the field. Based
on this, we further discuss open challenges and propose future directions for
the next phase of earable research.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）模拟语言病理学家（SLPs）的推理过程，以支持对日常亲子互动中联合注意力的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合注意力是早期社交沟通发展的关键指标，但家长难以在没有专家指导的情况下评估。研究旨在通过MLLMs模拟SLPs的评估过程，提供支持。

Method: 通过访谈和视频标注研究，提取SLPs评估联合注意力的三个核心行为线索（注视、动作、发声），并开发了一个两阶段的MLLM系统：行为描述提取和专家对齐的联合注意力评估。

Result: 在26段亲子互动视频中，MLLMs在行为线索提取上达到85%的准确率，在模拟专家评估上平均精度超过75%。

Conclusion: 研究提供了基于SLPs专业知识的结构化行为线索，验证了MLLMs模拟SLPs评估的可行性，并提出了设计指南，支持亲子互动分析系统的开发。

Abstract: Joint attention is a critical marker of early social-communicative
development, yet remains difficult for caregivers to assess without expert
guidance. In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
can be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists
(SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We
conducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three
experienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three
core behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we
developed a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained
behavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention
quality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child
interaction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in
perceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert
judgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based
behaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the
structuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries
grounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses
based on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This
work provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise,
demonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using
MLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to
support parent-child interaction analysis.

TL;DR: QualitEye是一种验证图像视线数据质量的方法，通过语义表示和隐私保护协议实现高效验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视线数据收集面临数据质量和隐私问题，需要一种可靠且隐私保护的验证方法。

Method: QualitEye使用语义表示和隐私保护协议（如私有集合交集）进行数据验证，适用于公开和隐私保护场景。

Result: 在MPIIFaceGaze和GazeCapture数据集上验证性能高，隐私保护版本运行时开销小。

Conclusion: QualitEye为机器学习、人机交互和密码学交叉领域的视线分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Result: 研究发现伦理是设计活动中动态、情境化的部分，可通过协作培养。

Conclusion: HCI因其实践导向研究经验，适合引导设计伦理领域发展，并提出六个未来方向。

Abstract: As emerging technologies continue to shape society, there is a growing
emphasis on the need to engage with design ethics as it unfolds in practice to
better capture the complexities of ethical considerations embedded in
day-to-day work. Positioned within the broader "turn to practice" in HCI, the
review characterizes this body of work in terms of its motivations, conceptual
frameworks, methodologies, and contributions across a range of design
disciplines and academic databases. The findings reveal a shift away from
static and abstract ethical frameworks toward an understanding of ethics as an
evolving, situated, and inherent aspect of design activities, one that can be
cultivated and fostered collaboratively. This review proposes six future
directions for establishing common research priorities and fostering the
field's growth. While the review promotes cross-disciplinary dialogue, we argue
that HCI research, given its cumulative experience with practice-oriented
research, is well-equipped to guide this emerging strand of work on design
ethics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合语音输入、手势识别和多代理大语言模型（LLM）的混合现实（MR）界面，用于支持直观的参数化建模，解决了现有MR工具在精度和控制上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MR工具在参数化建模中缺乏精确控制和表达能力，尤其对非编程背景的设计师不友好。

Method: 引入了一种新型的MR界面，结合语音、手势和LLM系统，动态管理参数状态，通过对话和上下文提示解决模糊命令，并支持实时模型操作。

Result: 该系统降低了早期设计任务中的认知和操作障碍，帮助用户更直观地探索和优化设计空间。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了MR在生成设计平台中的作用，通过自然交互支持设计任务中的程序化思维。

Abstract: Mixed reality (MR) environments offer embodied spatial interaction, providing
intuitive 3D manipulation capabilities that enhance the conceptual design
process. Parametric modeling, a powerful and advanced architectural design
method, enables the generation of complex, optimized geometries. However, its
integration into MR environments remains limited due to precision constraints
and unsuitable input modalities. Existing MR tools prioritize spatial
interaction but lack the control and expressiveness required for parametric
workflows, particularly for designers without formal programming backgrounds.
We address this gap by introducing a novel conversational MR interface that
combines speech input, gesture recognition, and a multi-agent large language
model (LLM) system to support intuitive parametric modeling. Our system
dynamically manages parameter states, resolves ambiguous commands through
conversation and contextual prompting, and enables real-time model manipulation
within immersive environments. We demonstrate how this approach reduces
cognitive and operational barriers in early-stage design tasks, allowing users
to refine and explore their design space. This work expands the role of MR to a
generative design platform, supporting programmatic thinking in design tasks
through natural, embodied interaction.

Motivation: 大数据时代下，传统定性分析方法难以应对大规模数据集，且计算方法的可信度是研究者的主要关切。

Method: 提出了一种'人机协同'的计算扎根理论（CGT）框架，结合ML和NLP工具，同时保留研究者对分析过程的控制。

Result: 通过Reddit数据集测试，验证了CGT框架在分析大规模定性数据时的有效性和可信度。

Conclusion: CGT框架为大规模定性数据分析提供了一种可信且高效的方法，同时保持了传统扎根理论的严谨性。

Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities
and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social
science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major
challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are
often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this
issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability
limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness
of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the
credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop'
methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the
analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this
in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded
Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while
maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To
illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a
dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors'
experiences in the gig economy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: sQRy技术允许在QR码中嵌入可运行程序，但字符串占用空间限制了程序长度，影响了其广泛应用。

Method: 提出了一种简单有效的策略来减少字符串的空间占用。

Result: 通过减少字符串占用空间，扩展了sQRy的适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为sQRy技术的更广泛应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Executable QR codes, or sQRy, is a technology dated 2022 that permits to
include a runnable program inside a QR code, enabling interaction with the user
even in the absence of an Internet connection. sQRy are enablers for different
practical applications, including network equipment configuration, diagnostics,
and enhanced smart manuals in industrial contexts. Many other
non-industry-related fields can also benefit from this technology. Regardless
of where sQRy are used, text strings are among the most commonly embedded data.
However, due to strict limitations on the available payload, the occupancy of
strings limits the length of the programs that can be embedded. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective strategy that can reduce the space taken by
strings, hence broadening sQRy applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性伤口在老年人群中日益普遍，传统护理资源密集且效率低，亟需远程解决方案。

Method: 开发了WoundAIssist应用，结合患者数据和AI模型，支持远程监测和视频咨询，并通过用户中心设计优化体验。

Result: 可用性研究表明应用易用性强，AI识别功能获好评。

Conclusion: WoundAIssist填补了患者与医疗人员间的远程护理空白，并为类似数字健康工具提供了设计参考。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,
presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,
elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is
resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present
WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to
support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly
document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians
remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video
consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep
learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with
patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing
progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving
both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly
design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with
patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and
favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution
is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an
easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap
between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for
remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of
interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital
health tools across clinical domains.

Method: 采用混合方法研究，通过Likert量表和PLS-SEM分析56名高中生的数据，并结合定性分析。

Result: 学生对AI角色的信任影响其社交存在感，进而提升感知有效性。材料可信度和学习目标一致性是信任的关键因素。

Conclusion: AI生成角色在SBA中具有潜力，信任和社交存在感是其成功应用的关键。

Abstract: While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical
approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between
in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment
practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated
characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment
(SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of
competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents
to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the
assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability
of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as
text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated
characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI
characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the
context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the
Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence,
and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and
their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our
findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence
with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis
further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and
alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence
in creating a collaborative context.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI的普及，老年人等弱势群体需要了解其益处和风险，但他们对新技术的接受度较低，需定制化的教育支持。

Method: 采用混合方法，通过聊天机器人Litti向老年人提供GenAI素养教育，并评估其对AI知识、安全和伦理使用的影响。

Result: 定量数据显示AI素养有提升趋势但不显著；定性访谈显示老年人学习意愿强，但Litti未显著提升其对GenAI的信任或安全感。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了为老年人设计AI素养教育的挑战与机遇，需进一步探索更有效的教育方式。

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICRL面临状态-动作-奖励数据的多模态性和任务多样性的挑战，需要一种更高效的框架来适应不同任务。

Method: T2MIR用token-wise和task-wise MoE层替代传统前馈层，并通过对比学习优化任务路由。

Result: 实验表明T2MIR显著优于基线方法，提升了上下文学习能力。

Conclusion: T2MIR为ICRL提供了一种简单且可扩展的架构改进，推动了其在语言和视觉领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise
\textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that
introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into
transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with
two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input
tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse
tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with
alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a
contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the
task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of
task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated
and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR
significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various
types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering
a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer
toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available

Conclusion: MTPNet通过条件深度学习内化相互作用模式，实现活性悬崖的统一预测，加速化合物优化与设计。

Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material
design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding
targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this
paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to
incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their
target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff
prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)
guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet
dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein
semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the
receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical
interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff
datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,
achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream
GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through
conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs,
helping to accelerate compound optimization and design. Codes are available at:

progression. We propose MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes
clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data,
achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance.
First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising
network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up
sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven
"linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling:
generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a
fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers,
guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns.
Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

TL;DR: 论文提出PCDVQ框架，通过极坐标解耦和分布对齐码本构建，显著提升2-bit量化的LLMs零样本准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法在方向量化时误差较大，且欧氏距离更关注幅度误差，与方向敏感性的发现相矛盾。

Method: 提出PCDVQ框架，包括极坐标解耦（PCD）和分布对齐码本构建（DACC），独立量化方向与幅度。

Result: PCDVQ在2-bit量化下比基线方法至少提升1.5%的零样本准确率。

Conclusion: PCDVQ为高压缩LLMs提供了一种新范式，显著提升量化精度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

Conclusion: Agentomics-ML缩小了全自主系统与专家构建模型的性能差距，展示了在计算生物学中的潜力。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods has
revolutionized molecular medicine by driving breakthroughs in genomics,
transcriptomics, drug discovery, and biological systems modeling. The
increasing quantity, multimodality, and heterogeneity of biological datasets
demand automated methods that can produce generalizable predictive models.
Recent developments in large language model-based agents have shown promise for
automating end-to-end ML experimentation on structured benchmarks. However,
when applied to heterogeneous computational biology datasets, these methods
struggle with generalization and success rates. Here, we introduce
Agentomics-ML, a fully autonomous agent-based system designed to produce a
classification model and the necessary files for reproducible training and
inference. Our method follows predefined steps of an ML experimentation
process, repeatedly interacting with the file system through Bash to complete
individual steps. Once an ML model is produced, training and validation metrics
provide scalar feedback to a reflection step to identify issues such as
overfitting. This step then creates verbal feedback for future iterations,
suggesting adjustments to steps such as data representation, model
architecture, and hyperparameter choices. We have evaluated Agentomics-ML on
several established genomic and transcriptomic benchmark datasets and show that
it outperforms existing state-of-the-art agent-based methods in both
generalization and success rates. While state-of-the-art models built by domain
experts still lead in absolute performance on the majority of the computational
biology datasets used in this work, Agentomics-ML narrows the gap for fully
autonomous systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on one of the used
benchmark datasets. The code is available at

TL;DR: Prefix Grouper是一种高效的GRPO训练算法，通过共享前缀计算减少冗余，提升长上下文学习场景下的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在处理长共享前缀时存在计算冗余问题，成为扩展性的瓶颈。

Method: 提出Shared-Prefix Forward策略，将自注意力分为两部分，共享前缀仅编码一次，保持端到端训练兼容性。

Result: 理论和实验证明Prefix Grouper与标准GRPO训练等效，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: Prefix Grouper可无缝集成现有GRPO架构，提升任务复杂性和模型规模的扩展性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by
computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that
share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces
substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which
must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a
major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose
Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant
prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by
restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared
prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and
compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO:
it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the
optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged.
Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent
results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training,
particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully
plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can
be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in
replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to
input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of
larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the
scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models. Code is now

Motivation: 传统QD算法依赖手工设计的行为描述符，限制了探索的多样性。AutoQD旨在自动生成行为描述符，以支持更开放的探索。

Method: 利用随机傅里叶特征近似策略占用度量的最大均值差异（MMD），生成反映行为差异的嵌入，并将其投影为低维描述符。

Result: 实验证明AutoQD能在连续控制任务中发现多样化策略，无需预定义描述符，且嵌入距离随样本和维度增加收敛于真实MMD。

Conclusion: AutoQD为无监督强化学习和QD优化提供了新思路，支持无需领域知识的开放学习和行为发现。

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in
discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on
hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined
notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy
measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically
generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies
in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier
features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy
occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful
behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that
captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as
behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our
embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the
number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through
experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's
ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral
descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in
unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new
possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in
sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific
knowledge.

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on
autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making.
Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of
tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth,
asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common
objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task
similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are
challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and
beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular
Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm
that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also
identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without
coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three
mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine
similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and
(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL
benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated
learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds
solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The
collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the
emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings
support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve
better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and
collective levels.

Result: lip-rcp在ImageNet等大规模场景中，预测集大小和计算效率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: lip-rcp不仅提升了鲁棒性，还保持了高效性，为对抗攻击下的CP提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for
improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets
with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical
conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the
field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to
provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but,
for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are
too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to
precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a
1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms
state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and
computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.
Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new
worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously
for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second
approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

Conclusion: 方法有效实现包装状态监测，兼顾性能和资源效率。

Abstract: Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with
significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological
sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded
system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a
Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a
lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages.
Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing
wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and
evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time
series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify
accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation
techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling
approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a
small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a
precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while
compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained
model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption
of 316 mW during inference.

Result: 在两个轴承生命周期数据集上验证，该方法优于对比方法，动态HI在预测任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的动态HI构建方法有效捕捉退化过程的动态内容，提升了退化趋势建模和预测能力。

Abstract: Health indicator (HI) plays a key role in degradation assessment and
prognostics of rolling bearings. Although various HI construction methods have
been investigated, most of them rely on expert knowledge for feature extraction
and overlook capturing dynamic information hidden in sequential degradation
processes, which limits the ability of the constructed HI for degradation trend
representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI
that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an
unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module
composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a
representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract
essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.
Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner
HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal
dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled
explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic
contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation
tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on
two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction
method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is
superior for prognostic tasks.

Conclusion: UniPTMs框架突破了单类型预测范式，平衡了模型复杂性与性能，为PTM预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher
dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep
learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and
architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified
framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes
a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path
dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,
structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated
Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature
discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features
using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale
Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and
a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level
feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic
Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal
features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for
feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance
improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art
models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction
Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have
also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

Result: 在连续控制任务中，DoSAC在混淆环境下优于基线方法，表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DoSAC通过因果干预有效解决了隐藏混淆问题，为RL策略学习提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy
learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or
non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning
policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical
associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft
Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC
algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention
estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$
using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or
causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor
that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current
state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is
integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the
interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control
benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings,
with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

Result: 模型规模扩大能降低损失减速的起点，并改善减速后的损失改进速率。

Conclusion: 损失减速和ZSL为语言模型训练动态提供了新见解，可能直接优化模型性能。

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,
specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models
undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of
loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in
log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing
the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of
loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type
of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,
per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive
interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one
subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss
deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying
language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to
improve language models independent of scale. We make our code and artefacts
available at: https://github.com/mirandrom/zsl

Method: 使用标准两点估计器的零阶优化方法，分析其对Hessian矩阵迹较小的解的偏好，并理论证明其在凸且充分光滑函数上的收敛速率。

Result: 理论和实验表明，零阶优化倾向于选择平坦极小值（Hessian迹最小），在二元分类和语言模型微调任务中得到验证。

Conclusion: 零阶优化具有隐式正则化特性，偏好平坦极小值，为相关应用提供了理论依据和实用指导。

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications
where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box
attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing
optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point,
but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained
characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show
that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors
solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to
distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates
of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and
sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers
that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions.
Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language
model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

Metrical Task Systems (MTS), where each might be tailored to a different type
of input instances. While processing an input instance received online, we are
allowed to query the action of only one of the heuristics at each time step.
Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to the best of the given
heuristics. The main difficulty of our setting comes from the fact that the
cost paid by a heuristic at time $t$ cannot be estimated unless the same
heuristic was also queried at time $t-1$. This is related to Bandit Learning
against memory bounded adversaries (Arora et al., 2012). We show how to achieve
regret of $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ and prove a tight lower bound based on the
construction of Dekel et al. (2013).

Conclusion: 为6G系统中的GAI驱动语义传输提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging
the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation
is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which
elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a
closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion
parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution
mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a
mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust
performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.
Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model
(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is
employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a
universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free
at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale
pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and
mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines,
particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby
establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission
in future 6G systems.

TL;DR: 论文比较了两种将初始模型知识嵌入神经网络的方法（预训练和去归一化）在FWI中的效果，发现去归一化更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何更有效地将初始模型知识嵌入神经网络，以提升FWI的稳定性和准确性。

Method: 对比预训练和去归一化两种方法，分析其对神经网络参数更新和FWI效果的影响。

Result: 去归一化简化流程、加速收敛并提高反演精度，优于预训练。

Conclusion: 去归一化是更优的初始模型嵌入方法，适用于神经网络参数化的FWI。

Abstract: Subsurface property neural network reparameterized full waveform inversion
(FWI) has emerged as an effective unsupervised learning framework, which can
invert stably with an inaccurate starting model. It updates the trainable
neural network parameters instead of fine-tuning on the subsurface model
directly. There are primarily two ways to embed the prior knowledge of the
initial model into neural networks, that is, pretraining and denormalization.
Pretraining first regulates the neural networks' parameters by fitting the
initial velocity model; Denormalization directly adds the outputs of the
network into the initial models without pretraining. In this letter, we
systematically investigate the influence of the two ways of initial model
incorporation for the neural network reparameterized FWI. We demonstrate that
pretraining requires inverting the model perturbation based on a constant
velocity value (mean) with a two-stage implementation. It leads to a complex
workflow and inconsistency of objective functions in the two-stage process,
causing the network parameters to become inactive and lose plasticity.
Experimental results demonstrate that denormalization can simplify workflows,
accelerate convergence, and enhance inversion accuracy compared with
pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型（如大语言模型）在高风险应用中需要可靠的不确定性量化方法，而传统方法依赖于结构化输出，无法直接适用于黑盒模型。

Method: 提出了CPQ框架，基于统计中的缺失质量问题，设计最优查询策略和映射方法，并使用Good Turing估计器进行缺失质量估计。

Result: 实验表明，CPQ在三种开放任务和两种大语言模型上显著优于现有方法，提供了更信息丰富的预测集。

Conclusion: CPQ为黑盒生成模型的不确定性量化提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for safe deployment of
generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs), especially in high
stakes applications. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty
quantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and
classification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that
presuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a
query only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from
finite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off
between coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce
Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the
optimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is
built on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the
other defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.
Remarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in
statistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of
decay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel
estimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,
which we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to
implementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,
and often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open
ended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and
highlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,
and (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets
than existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多指标模型中有效，适用于深度神经网络等复杂场景。

Abstract: In this work we consider generic Gaussian Multi-index models, in which the
labels only depend on the (Gaussian) $d$-dimensional inputs through their
projection onto a low-dimensional $r = O_d(1)$ subspace, and we study efficient
agnostic estimation procedures for this hidden subspace. We introduce the
\emph{generative leap} exponent $k^\star$, a natural extension of the
generative exponent from [Damian et al.'24] to the multi-index setting. We
first show that a sample complexity of $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee \k/2})$ is necessary
in the class of algorithms captured by the Low-Degree-Polynomial framework. We
then establish that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by giving an
agnostic sequential estimation procedure (that is, requiring no prior knowledge
of the multi-index model) based on a spectral U-statistic over appropriate
Hermite tensors. We further compute the generative leap exponent for several
examples including piecewise linear functions (deep ReLU networks with bias),
and general deep neural networks (with $r$-dimensional first hidden layer).

Conclusion: 对称性和物理约束的结合显著提升了PDE代理模型的准确性和泛化能力，尤其在复杂任务和现实应用中表现突出。

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical
solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate
errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in
closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these
inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in
computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers
that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the
first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and
in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two
challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and
decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries
and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks,
architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network
sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates
with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or
pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick.
Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and
durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict
real-world ocean currents.

Method: 通过基于代理的LLM模拟和真实GPT使用数据，形式化并测试假设。

Result: 分析显示新GPT版本发布后多样性突然且持续下降，与假设一致。

Conclusion: 人类-AI反馈循环可能导致信念固化和多样性丧失，需引起关注。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和图像生成任务中显著提升了流模型的性能。

Conclusion: 大规模Sinkhorn耦合和低熵正则化参数是优化流模型训练的有效策略。

Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto
another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent
velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target
points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training
flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing
exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much
harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points
independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to
train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would
greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal
transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a
highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In
practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and
$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.
These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered
OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the
Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.
Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits
of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully
on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn
algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to
report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across
multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic
and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large
Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.

Motivation: 现有评估SGNNs表达能力的框架（如k-WL测试）与图谱不匹配，导致对SGNNs表达能力的理解有限。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出基于最大特征值多重性的表达层次结构，并引入旋转等变神经网络来提升SGNNs的表达能力。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，该方法能有效提升SGNNs在简单谱图上的表达能力。

Conclusion: 论文为SGNNs的表达能力提供了新的理论框架，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among
non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian
eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The
expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated
via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet,
these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight
into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of
classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an
expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete
even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt
rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a
method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We
empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification
experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on
graphs from ZINC.

Conclusion: SocialDF和LLM多因素检测方法为解决社交媒体上的深度伪造挑战提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep generative models has significantly improved
the realism of synthetic media, presenting both opportunities and security
challenges. While deepfake technology has valuable applications in
entertainment and accessibility, it has emerged as a potent vector for
misinformation campaigns, particularly on social media. Existing detection
frameworks struggle to distinguish between benign and adversarially generated
deepfakes engineered to manipulate public perception. To address this
challenge, we introduce SocialDF, a curated dataset reflecting real-world
deepfake challenges on social media platforms. This dataset encompasses
high-fidelity deepfakes sourced from various online ecosystems, ensuring broad
coverage of manipulative techniques. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-factor
detection approach that combines facial recognition, automated speech
transcription, and a multi-agent LLM pipeline to cross-verify audio-visual
cues. Our methodology emphasizes robust, multi-modal verification techniques
that incorporate linguistic, behavioral, and contextual analysis to effectively
discern synthetic media from authentic content.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）尚未充分利用边缘设备数据，联邦学习（FL）提供了一种无需将私有数据传输到云端的协作微调范式。然而，现有的LoRA方法在FL中因数据和计算异构性导致精度下降。

Method: 提出Ravan方法，将权重更新重新参数化为多个LoRA头部的加权和（s_iB_iH_iA_i），仅训练核心矩阵H_i和轻量级缩放因子s_i，优化聚焦于最有用的头部。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，Ravan比现有参数高效基线提高了2-8%的测试准确率。

Conclusion: Ravan是一种鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案，适用于LLMs的联邦微调，平衡了参数效率和模型表达能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not yet effectively leveraged the vast
amounts of edge-device data, and federated learning (FL) offers a promising
paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge
data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication
constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs
proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient
methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL
settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across
clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that
balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the
weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads
$s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices
$\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These
trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads,
recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing
the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$
directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
\textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient
baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning
of LLMs.

Conclusion: 任务多样性是ICL能力泛化的关键因素，模型深度和问题维度也会影响过渡行为。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained
transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only
a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the
pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize
\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct
tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of
task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear
functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a
transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the
pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of
distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the
solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and
observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a
phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with
the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as
the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem
influence the transition.

Conclusion: EqCollide能够泛化到更多碰撞物体和更长时间范围，并对群作用变换的输入保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is a fundamental yet challenging
task due to the complexity of modeling solid mechanics and multi-body
interactions. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of
equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and
limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end
equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their
collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and
velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural
Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions
among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct
velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features,
enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental
results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations
across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82%
lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model.
Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended
temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了子群偏移下的保形预测问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning
models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees.
However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution
shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or
calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts,
where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of
subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that
provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage
without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms
scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine
learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and
language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods
reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard
conformal prediction fails.

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online
reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete
actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman
optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model
Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms
for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,
which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the
effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into
actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling
optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To
address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from
the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating
learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC,
significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and
manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to
hyperparameters related to optimality.

Abstract: Leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) capability of Large Language Models

training-free adaptability across diverse datasets. Recent advancements, like
TabPFN, excel in small-scale tabular datasets but struggle to scale for large

TabPFN for larger datasets by incorporating linear attention mechanisms as a
scalable alternative to complexity-quadratic self-attention. Our model,
TabFlex, efficiently handles tabular datasets with thousands of features and
hundreds of classes, scaling seamlessly to millions of samples. For instance,
TabFlex processes the poker-hand dataset with over a million samples in just 5
seconds. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TabFlex can achieve over a
2x speedup compared to TabPFN and a 1.5x speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25

Furthermore, TabFlex remains highly effective on large-scale datasets,
delivering strong performance with significantly reduced computational costs,
especially when combined with data-efficient techniques such as dimensionality

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime,
achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively
steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However,
in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical
assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among
isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of
Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot
learning. DMPEL progressively learn a low-rank expert library and employs a
lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy,
facilitating flexible behavior during lifelong adaptation. Moreover, by
leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce
coefficient replay to guide the router in accurately retrieving frozen experts
for previously encountered tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
This method is significantly more storage- and computationally-efficient than
applying demonstration replay to the entire policy. Extensive experiments on
the lifelong manipulation benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates across
continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

Conclusion: CoFrNet兼具强大表示能力和可解释性，为可解释神经网络提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research on local
post hoc explanations for neural networks. However, work on building
interpretable neural architectures has been relatively sparse. In this paper,
we present a novel neural architecture, CoFrNet, inspired by the form of
continued fractions which are known to have many attractive properties in
number theory, such as fast convergence of approximations to real numbers. We
show that CoFrNets can be efficiently trained as well as interpreted leveraging
their particular functional form. Moreover, we prove that such architectures
are universal approximators based on a proof strategy that is different than
the typical strategy used to prove universal approximation results for neural
networks based on infinite width (or depth), which is likely to be of
independent interest. We experiment on nonlinear synthetic functions and are
able to accurately model as well as estimate feature attributions and even
higher order terms in some cases, which is a testament to the representational
power as well as interpretability of such architectures. To further showcase
the power of CoFrNets, we experiment on seven real datasets spanning tabular,
text and image modalities, and show that they are either comparable or
significantly better than other interpretable models and multilayer
perceptrons, sometimes approaching the accuracies of state-of-the-art models.

Result: 实证研究表明，通过简单方法可以显著提升零-shot性能。

Conclusion: 本文为逆折叠模型的自由能基础提供了更清晰的理解，并展示了改进零-shot稳定性预测的潜力。

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

TL;DR: FaCTR是一种轻量级时空Transformer，通过动态对称跨通道交互和低秩因子分解机解决时间序列数据的信息密度低和复杂依赖问题，性能优越且参数少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在时间序列预测中因架构复杂和过参数化导致性能下降，而时间序列数据具有低信息密度和复杂依赖特性，需要结构化设计。

Method: FaCTR采用动态对称跨通道交互（低秩因子分解机）和可学习门控机制，结合静态和动态协变量进行多变量条件建模。

Result: 在11个公共预测基准测试中，FaCTR性能最优，最大变体仅需40万参数，比基线模型小50倍，且支持可解释性和自监督预训练。

Conclusion: FaCTR是一种紧凑且通用的时间序列基础模型，适用于实际决策和下游任务。

Abstract: While Transformers excel in language and vision-where inputs are semantically
rich and exhibit univariate dependency structures-their architectural
complexity leads to diminishing returns in time series forecasting. Time series
data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex
dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on
structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and
overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal
Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic,
symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization
Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable
gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for
multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning
both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to
only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal
transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables
interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential
requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports
self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile
foundation for downstream time series tasks.

Motivation: 研究MaxEnt RL在性能关键控制问题中的表现，分析其稳健性与最优性的权衡。

Method: 通过实验分析MaxEnt RL在多种控制问题中的表现，探讨熵最大化对策略优化的影响。

Result: 实验表明，熵最大化可能误导策略优化，导致在需要精确策略的任务中失败。

Conclusion: 研究为在复杂控制问题中平衡奖励设计与熵最大化提供了更好的理解。

Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) framework is a leading
approach for achieving efficient learning and robust performance across many RL
tasks. However, MaxEnt methods have also been shown to struggle with
performance-critical control problems in practice, where non-MaxEnt algorithms
can successfully learn. In this work, we analyze how the trade-off between
robustness and optimality affects the performance of MaxEnt algorithms in
complex control tasks: while entropy maximization enhances exploration and
robustness, it can also mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in
tasks that require precise, low-entropy policies. Through experiments on a
variety of control problems, we concretely demonstrate this misleading effect.
Our analysis leads to better understanding of how to balance reward design and
entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

Result: 理论分析和数值实验验证了该方法的效率和可扩展性，适用于高维卷积映射的奇异值计算。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算高维卷积映射的奇异值提供了实用解决方案，并支持奇异向量的计算。

Abstract: The singular values of convolutional mappings encode interesting spectral
properties, which can be used, e.g., to improve generalization and robustness
of convolutional neural networks as well as to facilitate model compression.
However, the computation of singular values is typically very
resource-intensive. The naive approach involves unrolling the convolutional
mapping along the input and channel dimensions into a large and sparse
two-dimensional matrix, making the exact calculation of all singular values
infeasible due to hardware limitations. In particular, this is true for
matrices that represent convolutional mappings with large inputs and a high
number of channels. Existing efficient methods leverage the Fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) to transform convolutional mappings into the frequency
domain, enabling the computation of singular values for matrices representing
convolutions with larger input and channel dimensions. For a constant number of
channels in a given convolution, an FFT can compute N singular values in O(N
log N) complexity. In this work, we propose an approach of complexity O(N)
based on local Fourier analysis, which additionally exploits the shift
invariance of convolutional operators. We provide a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm's runtime and validate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is scalable and offers a
practical solution to calculate the entire set of singular values - along with
the corresponding singular vectors if needed - for high-dimensional
convolutional mappings.

Abstract: Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a
form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources
into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to
simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast,
hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly
connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning
often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the fine-grained semantic
modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to
better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world
knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling
n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first
dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e.,
translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural
network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based
models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of
entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less,
position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing
datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire
future research.

Conclusion: 该方法为理解和引导CLM生成机制提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target
molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery,
chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient
training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with
a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular
similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual
representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular
similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy
of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the
distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to
encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the
method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,
GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which
enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the
contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further
integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard
molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular
rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,
GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing
training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings
in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative
mechanisms of CLMs.

Conclusion: 新方法在概率分布耦合及其应用中表现出色，为推测采样和分布式压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions --
a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared
if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other
distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends
the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for
coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower
bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We
next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism
for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves
performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a
range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter
invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing
schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level
acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed
lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is
compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side
information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our
generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant
gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image
dataset.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning often involve making predictions based on
both model outputs and the opinions of human experts. In this context, we
investigate the problem of querying experts for class label predictions, using
as few human queries as possible, and leveraging the class probability
estimates of pre-trained classifiers. We develop a general Bayesian framework
for this problem, modeling expert correlation via a joint latent
representation, enabling simulation-based inference about the utility of
additional expert queries, as well as inference of posterior distributions over
unobserved expert labels. We apply our approach to two real-world medical
classification problems, as well as to CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H,
demonstrating substantial reductions relative to baselines in the cost of
querying human experts while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过建模参数重要性权重，显著提升了生成模型中的数据归因效果。

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Conclusion: BAQ通过优化位宽分配显著提升量化效果，理论分析支持其性能优势。

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

*Haoyang Jiang,Jindong Wang,Xingquan Zhu,Yi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，结合显式差异矩阵和隐式物理约束，使GNN能捕捉有向图中的高频信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在处理有向图时难以保留节点信号的高频成分，导致无法区分正向和反向拓扑结构。

Method: 结合显式差异矩阵（建模方向梯度）和隐式物理约束（确保消息传递符合自然规律）。

Result: 在真实世界的有向图数据（水通量网络和城市交通流网络）上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了GNN对高频信号的敏感性，从而更好地捕捉拓扑差异。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle in preserving high-frequency
components of nodal signals when dealing with directed graphs. Such components
are crucial for modeling flow dynamics, without which a traditional GNN tends
to treat a graph with forward and reverse topologies equal.To make GNNs
sensitive to those high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture
detailed topological differences, this paper proposes a novel framework that
combines 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and
2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to
be consistent with natural laws. Evaluations on two real-world directed graph
data, namely, water flux network and urban traffic flow network, demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposal.

TL;DR: 提出了一种合成基准框架，用于评估不同序列模型捕捉不同时间结构的能力，通过生成具有明确时间依赖性的合成目标，系统分析了模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前序列建模架构的多样性使得系统评估其优缺点成为挑战，因此需要一种可控的方法来量化模型对不同时间结构的捕捉能力。

Method: 设计了合成基准框架，生成具有不同记忆功能和时间依赖强度的目标，构建连续任务集以分析模型行为。

Result: 实验验证了现有理论，并揭示了新发现，表明该方法能有效提升理论理解。

Conclusion: 使用具有明确结构的可控目标对评估序列建模架构至关重要，该方法为理论研究和模型设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: The evolution of sequence modeling architectures, from recurrent neural
networks and convolutional models to Transformers and structured state-space
models, reflects ongoing efforts to address the diverse temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. Despite this progress, systematically
characterizing the strengths and limitations of these architectures remains a
fundamental challenge.In this work, we propose a synthetic benchmarking
framework to evaluate how effectively different sequence models capture
distinct temporal structures. The core of this approach is to generate
synthetic targets, each characterized by a memory function and a parameter that
determines the strength of temporal dependence. This setup allows us to produce
a continuum of tasks that vary in temporal complexity, enabling fine-grained
analysis of model behavior concerning specific memory properties. We focus on
four representative memory functions, each corresponding to a distinct class of
temporal structures.Experiments on several sequence modeling architectures
confirm existing theoretical insights and reveal new findings.These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in advancing theoretical
understandingand highlight the importance of using controllable targets with
clearly defined structures for evaluating sequence modeling architectures.

TL;DR: ManGO是一种基于扩散的框架，通过学习设计-评分流形，统一前向预测和后向生成，实现超出训练数据的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统的优化是科学和工程中的基本挑战，传统方法在训练数据外表现不佳。

Method: ManGO采用扩散模型，结合无导数引导和自适应推理时间缩放，动态优化去噪路径。

Result: ManGO在多个领域（如机器人控制、材料设计等）优于24种单目标和10种多目标优化方法。

Conclusion: ManGO通过统一设计-评分空间，显著提升了离线优化的泛化能力。

Abstract: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world
engineering optimization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态多任务联邦基础模型（FedFMs）的扩展现实（XR）系统架构，旨在通过结合基础模型的表示能力和联邦学习的隐私保护训练原则，解决XR系统中的关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XR系统需要处理多模态、多任务和隐私保护的需求，而现有的方法难以兼顾这些方面。因此，论文提出FedFMs作为解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种模块化的FedFMs架构，包括模型训练和聚合的协调范式，并定义了SHIFT维度（传感器多样性、硬件异构性、交互性、任务可变性和时间性）以解决XR挑战。

Result: 论文展示了FedFMs在XR应用中的潜力，并提出了评估指标、数据集需求和设计权衡，以支持资源感知的FedFMs开发。

Conclusion: 该研究为下一代XR系统中的上下文感知隐私保护智能技术奠定了技术和概念基础。

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR),
augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative
interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated
foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems
through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models
(FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated
learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails
different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central
to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the
implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality
diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3)
Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated
applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset
requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of
resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and
conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the
next generation of XR systems.

*Pavel Dolin,Weizhi Li,Gautam Dasarathy,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文主张临床AI的部署后监测不足，提出基于统计有效性和标签效率的测试框架，以提升可靠性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床AI工具中仅9%包含部署后监测计划，且方法多为手动、零散和被动，无法适应动态环境。

Method: 提出将数据变化和模型性能退化问题转化为统计假设检验问题，采用标签高效和统计有效的方法。

Result: 通过统计严谨性确保监测的科学性和可重复性，为临床AI系统提供可靠基础。

Conclusion: 统计有效的监测框架不仅满足监管需求，还为技术社区开辟了新研究方向。

Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is
underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing
frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in
real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered
AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing
monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them
ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We
contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient
and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative
to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods
that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable
formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support
reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.
Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model
performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis
testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a
reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of
clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the
technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically
principled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model
failures in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的持续学习问题（CL-DC），即动态能力下的持续学习，并提出了一个基于动作表示空间的框架（AACL）来解决策略泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法假设代理能力静态，而现实中能力动态变化，因此需要解决动态能力下的策略泛化问题。

Method: 提出AACL框架，通过构建动作表示空间解耦策略与具体动作空间，并自适应微调编码器-解码器以平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Result: 实验结果表明，AACL框架在跨动作空间的策略泛化上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AACL框架为动态能力下的持续学习提供了一种有效解决方案，并通过基准测试验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a
sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for
problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often
assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,
which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically
change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning
with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL
agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be
achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive
Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework
decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an
action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of
action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between
stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three
environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by
generalizing the policy across action spaces.

TL;DR: CoTo是一种渐进式训练策略，通过随机停用适配器来优化LoRA的微调效果，提升模型泛化能力和下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调大模型时容易陷入次优解，影响泛化和下游操作（如适配器合并和剪枝）。

Method: 提出CoTo策略，逐步增加适配器的激活概率，通过随机停用适配器促进更平衡的优化和损失空间的探索。

Result: 实验表明，CoTo提升了单任务性能、多任务合并准确性、剪枝鲁棒性，并减少了训练开销。

Conclusion: CoTo是一种兼容性强且高效的LoRA优化方法，适用于多种变体。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading parameter-efficient
fine-tuning technique for adapting large foundation models, yet it often locks
adapters into suboptimal minima near their initialization. This hampers model
generalization and limits downstream operators such as adapter merging and
pruning. Here, we propose CoTo, a progressive training strategy that gradually
increases adapters' activation probability over the course of fine-tuning. By
stochastically deactivating adapters, CoTo encourages more balanced
optimization and broader exploration of the loss landscape. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that CoTo promotes layer-wise dropout stability
and linear mode connectivity, and we adopt a cooperative-game approach to
quantify each adapter's marginal contribution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoTo consistently boosts single-task performance, enhances
multi-task merging accuracy, improves pruning robustness, and reduces training
overhead, all while remaining compatible with diverse LoRA variants. Code is

TL;DR: EEDQN结合集成与弹性步长更新，解决了DQN中的高估偏差和样本效率问题，在MinAtar基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习中高估偏差和样本效率的挑战。

Method: 提出EEDQN算法，结合集成与弹性步长更新。

Result: 在MinAtar环境中表现稳健，优于基线DQN并匹配或超越先进集成DQN。

Conclusion: 系统整合算法改进可带来显著收益，集成与多步方法结合潜力大。

Abstract: While many algorithmic extensions to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been
proposed, there remains limited understanding of how different improvements
interact. In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown
promise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency
and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called
Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step
updates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two
major challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample
efficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants
across the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral
learning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that
EEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,
outperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art
ensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These
findings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic
improvements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when
carefully integrated, can yield substantial gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过正则化（显式或隐式）诱导神经网络在梯度优化中的延迟泛化现象（grokking），并分析了不同正则化方法的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究grokking现象的成因，尤其是正则化在其中的作用，以及如何通过不同方式（如深度增加或数据选择）调控这一现象。

Method: 通过实验和理论分析，展示了小规模正则化（如ℓ₁或核范数）如何诱导grokking，并探讨了过参数化和数据选择的影响。

Result: 发现正则化可以诱导grokking，且ℓ₂范数在非权重衰减情况下不能可靠反映泛化能力；深度增加和数据选择能进一步调控grokking。

Conclusion: 正则化是grokking的关键因素，而模型结构和数据选择也能显著影响这一现象，为理解神经网络泛化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when
optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either
explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model
with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the
problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization
of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.
This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces
grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding
depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using
regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the
$\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is
regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many
cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also
show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any
other hyperparameter fixed.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进多标签分类（MLC）损失函数的方法，通过引入“任意类存在似然”来优化负数据对学习的影响，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多标签分类任务中，大量未标记的负数据会干扰学习过程，影响正实例的准确分类。传统方法为负数据分配单独类别会增加冗余，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 重新设计标准MLC损失函数，通过归一化加权几何平均预测类概率计算任意类存在似然，并引入正则化参数控制负类概率的贡献。

Result: 在SewerML、COCO和ChestX-ray14数据集上的实验表明，新损失函数显著提升了F1、F2和平均精度，最高提升6.01、8.06和3.11个百分点。

Conclusion: 提出的损失函数在不增加参数或计算复杂度的情况下，有效提升了多标签分类性能，尤其适用于负数据较多的场景。

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据流具有非平稳性，现有方法忽视了标签空间和分布的协同演化，导致在有限监督和持续不确定性下的适应能力不足。

Method: CSFA框架包括训练无关的原型校准机制和基于可靠代理间隙锐度感知的无源适应算法（RSGS），用于动态融合新类别原型和优化分布对齐。

Result: 实验证明CSFA在开放世界流场景中优于现有方法，能够稳定适应语义和分布的演化。

Conclusion: CSFA为开放环境流数据中的概念漂移问题提供了统一的解决方案，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Real-world data streams exhibit inherent non-stationarity characterized by
concept drift, posing significant challenges for adaptive learning systems.
While existing methods address isolated distribution shifts, they overlook the
critical co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited
supervision and persistent uncertainty. To address this, we formalize
Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD), characterizing
the joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in open-environment
streaming contexts, and propose a novel framework called Calibrated Source-Free
Adaptation (CSFA). First, CSFA introduces a training-free prototype calibration
mechanism that dynamically fuses emerging prototypes with base representations,
enabling stable new-class identification without optimization overhead. Second,
we design a novel source-free adaptation algorithm, i.e., Reliable Surrogate
Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization. It integrates sharpness-aware
perturbation loss optimization with surrogate gap minimization, while employing
entropy-based uncertainty filtering to discard unreliable samples. This
mechanism ensures robust distribution alignment and mitigates generalization
degradation caused by uncertainties. Therefore, CSFA establishes a unified
framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in
open-world streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the superior
performance and effectiveness of CSFA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 通过冻结的7B LLM、一行JSON规则和rank-16 LoRA适配器，替代传统重型奖励模型，实现高效RLHF，性能超越更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决奖励模型训练成本高、参数庞大的问题，提出轻量级替代方案。

Method: 使用冻结的7B LLM，结合JSON规则和LoRA适配器，无需离线调优。

Result: 在RewardBench上达到96.2%准确率，超越27B-70B模型；7B模型在GSM-8K上超越70B DPO基线。

Conclusion: 轻量级方法高效、透明且可调，实现RLHF的新突破。

Abstract: Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning
Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters
and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen,
instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a
rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling
it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight
evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on
RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B
parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO
baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K
utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context
demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements
(+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity,
particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed
model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic
HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated
justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains
approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot
judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of
prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and
easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving
new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行凸显了准确预测住院需求的重要性，但现有模型在变异株高峰期表现不佳。

Method: 采用LSTM框架，引入时空特征SPH，并结合多时间范围集成策略。

Result: 在Delta和Omicron高峰期，模型表现优于基准，预测误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 研究不仅改进了住院预测，还证明了时空特征在传染病建模中的重要性。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate,
timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning.
However, most forecasting models struggled, especially during variant surges,
when they were needed most. This study introduces a novel Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) framework for forecasting daily state-level incident
hospitalizations in the United States. We present a spatiotemporal feature,
Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate
population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization
forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features,
such as SPH, in refining predictive performance in modeling the complex
dynamics of infectious disease spread.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于流匹配模型的模仿学习框架flowOE，用于优化金融市场的执行策略，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最优执行策略（如静态Almgren-Chriss模型）在动态金融市场中表现不佳，需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: flowOE通过模仿学习从多种专家策略中学习，并结合精炼损失函数改进专家行为，适应不同市场条件。

Result: 实验表明，flowOE在多种市场条件下均显著优于传统基准，实现了更高的利润和更低的风险。

Conclusion: flowOE展示了在自适应最优执行中的实际应用潜力，为金融市场的执行策略提供了新思路。

Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically
transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible
outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or
volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static
Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets.
This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow
matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set
of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable
expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the
incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process,
enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert
actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow
matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical
evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE
significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and
other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These
results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to
enhance adaptive optimal execution.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双向轨迹扩散（BiTrajDiff）方法，通过同时建模未来和历史轨迹来增强离线强化学习的数据多样性，解决了现有数据增强技术仅关注未来轨迹的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中静态数据集存在分布偏差，限制了泛化能力。现有数据增强技术仅重构未来轨迹，忽略了历史过渡的探索。

Method: BiTrajDiff通过两个独立的扩散过程分别生成未来和历史的轨迹，利用关键状态作为锚点扩展状态空间。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，BiTrajDiff优于其他先进数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 双向轨迹扩散显著提升了离线强化学习的性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that
effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on
pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit
distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this
limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which
leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising
results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future
trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history
transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders
the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to
critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we
introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework
for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any
intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task
into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating
forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating
backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can
efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially
valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating
dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite
demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other
advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在加密货币价格预测中，经过数据预处理和特征工程后，简单模型的性能可以媲美甚至超越复杂神经网络，同时提供更快的推理速度和更强的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在加密货币限价订单簿（LOB）数据中，增加神经网络复杂性是否真正提升短期价格预测能力，还是主要依赖于数据预处理和特征工程。

Method: 比较了从可解释基线（如逻辑回归、XGBoost）到深度架构（如DeepLOB、Conv1D+LSTM）的多种模型，使用Bybit的BTC/USDT LOB数据，并引入两种数据过滤管道（Kalman、Savitzky Golay）和两种标签方案（二元和三元）。

Result: 结果显示，经过数据预处理和超参数调优后，简单模型的性能与复杂网络相当甚至更优，同时具有更快的推理速度和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在加密货币价格预测中，数据预处理和特征工程比模型复杂性更重要，简单模型在性能和效率上更具优势。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply
demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of
LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has
demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive
performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat
model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine
whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural
networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are
primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We
benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic
regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT
LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly
available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,
Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)
labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,
latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing
and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the
performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater
interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对齐和聚合框架，用于在结构不确定性下实现准确的虚拟筛选，显著提升了在apo结构上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟筛选方法依赖于已知配体结合口袋的holo结构，而在早期药物发现中常见的apo或预测结构（如AlphaFold2生成的结构）上性能显著下降。

Method: 方法包括：（1）三模态对比学习模块，对齐配体、holo口袋和检测到的空腔表示；（2）基于交叉注意力的适配器，动态聚合候选结合位点。

Result: 在apo结构基准测试中，EF1%从11.75提升至37.19，同时在holo结构上保持强性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏实验解析的蛋白质-配体复合物场景下，有望推动首创药物发现。

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet
most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are
developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.
Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted
structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of
real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often
missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to
enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method
comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that
aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected
from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and
(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate
binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without
precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated
benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment
factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong
performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our
approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios
lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

Result: 许多常用指标未能通过健全性测试，作者提出可靠的评估指标和未来指南。

Conclusion: 论文为评估神经网络解释提供了理论支持和实用指南。

Abstract: Understanding the function of individual units in a neural network is an
important building block for mechanistic interpretability. This is often done
by generating a simple text explanation of the behavior of individual neurons
or units. For these explanations to be useful, we must understand how reliable
and truthful they are. In this work we unify many existing explanation
evaluation methods under one mathematical framework. This allows us to compare
existing evaluation metrics, understand the evaluation pipeline with increased
clarity and apply existing statistical methods on the evaluation. In addition,
we propose two simple sanity checks on the evaluation metrics and show that
many commonly used metrics fail these tests and do not change their score after
massive changes to the concept labels. Based on our experimental and
theoretical results, we propose guidelines that future evaluations should
follow and identify a set of reliable evaluation metrics.

Result: SPDO在通信和计算复杂度上优于现有方法，实验验证其显著性能提升。

Conclusion: SPDO在PDO框架内实现了最优的通信和计算效率，为分布式优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reducing communication complexity is critical for efficient decentralized
optimization. The proximal decentralized optimization (PDO) framework is
particularly appealing, as methods within this framework can exploit functional
similarity among nodes to reduce communication rounds. Specifically, when local
functions at different nodes are similar, these methods achieve faster
convergence with fewer communication steps. However, existing PDO methods often
require highly accurate solutions to subproblems associated with the proximal
operator, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we
propose the Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO) method, which
achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities within
the PDO framework. Additionally, we refine the analysis of existing PDO methods
by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional
similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPDO significantly
outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is characterized by flexibility, high precision, and
refined structure. As a critical component within computational finance, option
pricing with machine learning requires both high predictive accuracy and
reduced structural complexity-features that align well with the inherent
advantages of ensemble learning. This paper investigates the application of
ensemble learning to option pricing, and conducts a comparative analysis with
classical machine learning models to assess their performance in terms of
accuracy, local feature extraction, and robustness to noise. A novel
experimental strategy is introduced, leveraging parameter transfer across
experiments to improve robustness and realism in financial simulations.Building
upon this strategy, an evaluation mechanism is developed that incorporates a
scoring strategy and a weighted evaluation strategy explicitly emphasizing the
foundational role of financial theory. This mechanism embodies an orderly
integration of theoretical finance and computational methods. In addition, the
study examines the interaction between sliding window technique and noise,
revealing nuanced patterns that suggest a potential connection relevant to
ongoing research in machine learning and data science.

Result: 证明了ONC的三个特性，并通过实验验证了这些特性。

Conclusion: ONC现象在序数回归任务中存在，且其几何特性可用于改进OR方法。

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks,
in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an
extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable
attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how
deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been
proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work
that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for
practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar
phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the
cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal
Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following
three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to
their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class
means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a
one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to
logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the
class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly
local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables
and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM
framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a
variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,
highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.

Motivation: 解决GNNs因局部归纳偏差而无法充分利用结构信息（如连通性和循环）的问题。

Method: 通过理论分析比较PE和PH的表达能力，设计了一种结合两者优势的新方法PiPE。

Result: PiPE在分子性质预测、图分类和分布外泛化等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PiPE是一种更强大的图表示学习方法，为图神经网络提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

Abstract: Backward compatible representation learning enables updated models to
integrate seamlessly with existing ones, avoiding to reprocess stored data.
Despite recent advances, existing compatibility approaches in Euclidean space
neglect the uncertainty in the old embedding model and force the new model to
reconstruct outdated representations regardless of their quality, thereby
hindering the learning process of the new model. In this paper, we propose to
switch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural
axis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings
into hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the
entailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across
models while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further
enhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that
dynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old
embeddings. Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in
achieving compatibility, paving the way for more resilient and adaptable
machine learning systems.

Motivation: 非平稳时间序列的统计特性随时间变化，导致深度学习模型泛化能力差。现有方法忽略了时间序列的多组分特性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，WDAN显著提高了预测准确性。

Conclusion: WDAN是一种模型无关的框架，能有效应对时间序列的非平稳性问题。

Abstract: Forecasting non-stationary time series is a challenging task because their
statistical properties often change over time, making it hard for deep models
to generalize well. Instance-level normalization techniques can help address
shifts in temporal distribution. However, most existing methods overlook the
multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit
distinct non-stationary behaviors. In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based
Disentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed
to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete
wavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and
high-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies
to each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we
apply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting
normalization parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various
backbone model. Code is available at this repository:

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Abstract: Clustering ensemble has emerged as an important research topic in the field
of machine learning. Although numerous methods have been proposed to improve
clustering quality, most existing approaches overlook the need for
interpretability in high-stakes applications. In domains such as medical
diagnosis and financial risk assessment, algorithms must not only be accurate
but also interpretable to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making.
Therefore, to fill the gap of lack of interpretable algorithms in the field of
clustering ensemble, we propose the first interpretable clustering ensemble
algorithm in the literature. By treating base partitions as categorical
variables, our method constructs a decision tree in the original feature space
and use the statistical association test to guide the tree building process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves comparable
performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering ensemble methods while
maintaining an additional feature of interpretability. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first interpretable algorithm specifically designed for
clustering ensemble, offering a new perspective for future research in
interpretable clustering.

Abstract: We present a feasibility-seeking approach to neural network training. This
mathematical optimization framework is distinct from conventional
gradient-based loss minimization and uses projection operators and iterative
projection algorithms. We reformulate training as a large-scale feasibility
problem: finding network parameters and states that satisfy local constraints
derived from its elementary operations. Training then involves projecting onto
these constraints, a local operation that can be parallelized across the
network. We introduce PJAX, a JAX-based software framework that enables this
paradigm. PJAX composes projection operators for elementary operations,
automatically deriving the solution operators for the feasibility problems
(akin to autodiff for derivatives). It inherently supports GPU/TPU
acceleration, provides a familiar NumPy-like API, and is extensible. We train
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) on standard benchmarks using PJAX,
demonstrating its functionality and generality. Our results show that this
approach is as a compelling alternative to gradient-based training, with clear
advantages in parallelism and the ability to handle non-differentiable
operations.

Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total
power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity
suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback
on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates
have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly
consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a
household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power
for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM
are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire
household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world
smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each
segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper
introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new
subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the
distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only
on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world
datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.
Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's
(Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed
insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power
consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

Abstract: Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against
climate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is
a significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of
smart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the
main electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces
valuable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;
nevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different
appliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to
apprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of
estimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of
individual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods
proposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning
approach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of
individual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and
extremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in
households to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a
weakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only
requires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be
trained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an
explainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.
Our experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates
that CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and
that current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more
labels to reach CamAL performances. The source of our experiments is available

Conclusion: 该框架为跟车建模提供了更全面的解决方案，能够同时捕捉驾驶行为的离散和连续特征。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in car-following modeling lies in accurately
representing the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, particularly the
intra-driver heterogeneity where a single driver's actions fluctuate
dynamically under varying conditions. While existing models, both conventional
and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often
emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions,
limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver
under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel
data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving
regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular
motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the
proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for
discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for
continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes
and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and
intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up
segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust
characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios.
Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces
prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%),
speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such
as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.

Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart
meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These
meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce
valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint.
However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand
these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a
significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the
aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels
(which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive
to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope,
an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by
detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time
period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance
Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization
that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a
household to be trained. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

Conclusion: Over-PINNs框架在解决多种PDE问题时表现出强通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone of
mathematical physics. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have significantly reduced the dependence on large datasets by embedding
physical laws directly into the training of neural networks. However, when
dealing with complex problems, the accuracy of PINNs still has room for
improvement. To address this issue, we introduce the Over-PINNs framework,
which leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to generate higher-order
auxiliary equations that impose additional physical constraints. These
equations are incorporated as extra loss terms in the training process,
effectively enhancing the model's ability to capture physical information
through an "overdetermined" approach. Numerical results illustrate that this
method exhibits strong versatility in solving various types of PDEs. It
achieves a significant improvement in solution accuracy without incurring
substantial additional computational costs.

Result: XGBoost在MAPE和Pinball损失上表现最优，显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法可显著降低大规模交通分配问题的计算负担。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the impact of road maintenance schedules on traffic
conditions is important because maintenance operations can substantially worsen
congestion if not carefully planned. Reliable estimates allow planners to avoid
excessive delays during periods of roadwork. Since the exact increase in
congestion is difficult to predict analytically, traffic simulations are
commonly used to assess the redistribution of the flow of traffic. However,
when applied to long-term maintenance planning involving many overlapping
projects and scheduling alternatives, these simulations must be run thousands
of times, resulting in a significant computational burden. This paper
investigates the use of machine learning-based surrogate models to predict
network-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. We frame the
problem as a supervised learning task, using one-hot encodings, engineered
traffic features, and heuristic approximations. A range of linear,
ensemble-based, probabilistic, and neural regression models is evaluated under
an online learning framework in which data progressively becomes available. The
experimental results show that the Costliest Subset Heuristic provides a
reasonable approximation when limited training data is available, and that most
regression models fail to outperform it, with the exception of XGBoost, which
achieves substantially better accuracy. In overall performance, XGBoost
significantly outperforms alternatives in a range of metrics, most strikingly
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Pinball loss, where it achieves a
MAPE of 11% and outperforms the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively.
This modeling approach has the potential to reduce the computational burden of
large-scale traffic assignment problems in maintenance planning.

Method: C-EDL通过生成多样化的任务保留变换，量化表示分歧，动态校准不确定性估计。

Result: C-EDL显著优于现有EDL变体和基线方法，OOD和对抗性数据覆盖率分别降低55%和90%。

Conclusion: C-EDL在不重新训练的情况下，有效提升了对抗性和OOD鲁棒性，同时保持高精度和低计算开销。

Abstract: Reliability of deep learning models is critical for deployment in high-stakes
applications, where out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs may lead to
detrimental outcomes. Evidential Deep Learning, an efficient paradigm for
uncertainty quantification, models predictions as Dirichlet distributions of a
single forward pass. However, EDL is particularly vulnerable to adversarially
perturbed inputs, making overconfident errors. Conflict-aware Evidential Deep
Learning (C-EDL) is a lightweight post-hoc uncertainty quantification approach
that mitigates these issues, enhancing adversarial and OOD robustness without
retraining. C-EDL generates diverse, task-preserving transformations per input
and quantifies representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates
when needed. C-EDL's conflict-aware prediction adjustment improves detection of
OOD and adversarial inputs, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy and low
computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation shows that C-EDL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EDL variants and competitive
baselines, achieving substantial reductions in coverage for OOD data (up to
55%) and adversarial data (up to 90%), across a range of datasets, attack
types, and uncertainty metrics.

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in
generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite
its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a
variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply
VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce
Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents
heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We
hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching,
enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and
discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow
matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences.
Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 研究为零售环境中的模型选择提供了实用指导，并强调了数据预处理对提升预测性能的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting is key for all business planning. When estimated sales
are too high, brick-and-mortar retailers may incur higher costs due to unsold
inventories, higher labor and storage space costs, etc. On the other hand, when
forecasts underestimate the level of sales, firms experience lost sales,
shortages, and impact on the reputation of the retailer in their relevant
market. Accurate forecasting presents a competitive advantage for companies. It
facilitates the achievement of revenue and profit goals and execution of
pricing strategy and tactics. In this study, we provide an exhaustive
assessment of the forecasting models applied to a high-resolution
brick-and-mortar retail dataset. Our forecasting framework addresses the
problems found in retail environments, including intermittent demand, missing
values, and frequent product turnover. We compare tree-based ensembles (such as
XGBoost and LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures
(including N-BEATS, NHITS, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer) across various
experimental settings. Our results show that localized modeling strategies
especially those using tree-based models on individual groups with non-imputed
data, consistently deliver superior forecasting accuracy and computational
efficiency. In contrast, neural models benefit from advanced imputation
methods, yet still fall short in handling the irregularities typical of
physical retail data. These results further practical understanding for model
selection in retail environment and highlight the significance of data
preprocessing to improve forecast performance.

Abstract: One-dimensional signal decomposition is a well-established and widely used
technique across various scientific fields. It serves as a highly valuable

applying the latest deep learning models to this problem presents an exciting,

the additive decomposition of one-dimensional signals. We leverage the
Transformer architecture to decompose signals into their constituent
components: piece-wise constant, smooth (low-frequency oscillatory), textured
(high-frequency oscillatory), and a noise component. Our model, trained on
synthetic data, achieves excellent accuracy in modeling and decomposing input
signals from the same distribution, as demonstrated by the experimental
results.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses sequential decision-making
problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected
return while meeting domain-specific constraints. In this setting, policy-based
methods are widely used thanks to their advantages when dealing with
continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an
action-based or a parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether
they learn the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic
hyperpolicy. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which
enjoys global last-iterate convergence guarantees under gradient domination
assumptions. Furthermore, under specific noise models where the (hyper)policy
is expressed as a stochastic perturbation of the actions or of the parameters
of an underlying deterministic policy, we additionally establish global
last-iterate convergence guarantees of C-PG to the optimal deterministic
policy. This holds when learning a stochastic (hyper)policy and subsequently
switching off the stochasticity at the end of training, thereby deploying a
deterministic policy. Finally, we empirically validate both the action-based
(C-PGAE) and parameter-based (C-PGPE) variants of C-PG on constrained control
tasks, and compare them against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their
effectiveness, in particular when deploying deterministic policies after
training.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance
degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering
their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed
various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge,
with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an
invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue
that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging
and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong
correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first
pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD
generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, \mine{} retains the invariant
subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization.
Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges:
1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2)
$\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious
edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that
PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods significantly. Codes are available at:

Method: 采用基于码本的加法向量量化方法对扩散模型进行压缩，并开发了高效的推理内核以实现FLOPs节省。

Abstract: Significant investments have been made towards the commodification of
diffusion models for generation of diverse media. Their mass-market adoption is
however still hobbled by the intense hardware resource requirements of
diffusion model inference. Model quantization strategies tailored specifically
towards diffusion models have been useful in easing this burden, yet have
generally explored the Uniform Scalar Quantization (USQ) family of quantization
methods. In contrast, Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, which operate on groups
of multiple related weights as the basic unit of compression, have seen
substantial success in Large Language Model (LLM) quantization. In this work,
we apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to the problem of
diffusion model compression. Our resulting approach achieves a new Pareto
frontier for the extremely low-bit weight quantization on the standard
class-conditional benchmark of LDM-4 on ImageNet at 20 inference time steps.
Notably, we report sFID 1.92 points lower than the full-precision model at W4A8
and the best-reported results for FID, sFID and ISC at W2A8. We are also able
to demonstrate FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware via an efficient inference
kernel, as opposed to savings resulting from small integer operations which may
lack broad hardware support.

Abstract: Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant
nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world
benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular
for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,
this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical
underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is
required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph
tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with
synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used
tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,
long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the
long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of
new datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in
environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy.
Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill
diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously
optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new
method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill
Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill
diversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify
and define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of
exploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining
phase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives
of exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance
on heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a
skill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream
tasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves
performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and
diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and
generalizable skill learning. Project Page: https://geonwoo.me/amped/

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于磁控共溅射的自驱动实验室（SDL）方法，用于快速生成多元素组合薄膜的成分分布图，避免了传统耗时且易出错的离线分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在薄膜科学中，现有的SDL主要局限于溶液合成方法，无法覆盖无机材料的广泛化学空间。本文旨在通过磁控溅射技术扩展SDL的应用范围。

Method: 利用石英晶体微天平传感器进行原位测量，结合高斯过程（GPs）和主动学习，预测多元素组合薄膜的成分分布。通过几何模型插值沉积速率，并使用贝叶斯主动学习方法（BALM）优化学习效率。

Conclusion: 该框架避免了繁琐的校准和表征，展示了机器学习引导的SDL在加速材料探索中的潜力。

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to
accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of
new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to
solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access
the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL
based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,
obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded
thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to
systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven
approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and
sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition
distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ
measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter
chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of
the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using
Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of
the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of
the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We
investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully
Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best
performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10
experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions
was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by
avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus
demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials
exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器在精度和效率之间存在固有权衡，而现有深度学习模型未考虑特定问题属性，难以准确处理复杂弹性-塑性固体变形。

Method: 将涉及细长固体的分区区域编码为令牌序列，设计两阶段Transformer模块预测变形。

Result: LaDEEP比有限元方法快五个数量级，精度相当，并比其他深度学习基线平均提升20.47%。

Conclusion: LaDEEP在实际工业生产中表现出色，为弹性-塑性固体大变形问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific computing for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids is
critical for numerous real-world applications. Classical numerical solvers rely
primarily on local discrete linear approximation and are constrained by an
inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Recently, deep learning
models have achieved impressive progress in solving the continuum mechanism.
While previous models have explored various architectures and constructed
coefficient-solution mappings, they are designed for general instances without
considering specific problem properties and hard to accurately handle with
complex elastic-plastic solids involving contact, loading and unloading. In
this work, we take stretch bending, a popular metal fabrication technique, as
our case study and introduce LaDEEP, a deep learning-based surrogate model for
\textbf{La}rge \textbf{De}formation of \textbf{E}lastic-\textbf{P}lastic
Solids. We encode the partitioned regions of the involved slender solids into a
token sequence to maintain their essential order property. To characterize the
physical process of the solid deformation, a two-stage Transformer-based module
is designed to predict the deformation with the sequence of tokens as input.
Empirically, LaDEEP achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element
methods with a comparable accuracy, and gains 20.47\% relative improvement on
average compared to other deep learning baselines. We have also deployed our
model into a real-world industrial production system, and it has shown
remarkable performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

Result: 投毒攻击能显著降低现有测试性能，甚至低于随机水平。

Conclusion: 成员推断测试在放宽定义后仍不可靠，需进一步研究其安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Membership inference tests aim to determine whether a particular data point
was included in a language model's training set. However, recent works have
shown that such tests often fail under the strict definition of membership
based on exact matching, and have suggested relaxing this definition to include
semantic neighbors as members as well. In this work, we show that membership
inference tests are still unreliable under this relaxation - it is possible to
poison the training dataset in a way that causes the test to produce incorrect
predictions for a target point. We theoretically reveal a trade-off between a
test's accuracy and its robustness to poisoning. We also present a concrete
instantiation of this poisoning attack and empirically validate its
effectiveness. Our results show that it can degrade the performance of existing
tests to well below random.

Abstract: Existing works on general time series forecasting build foundation models
with heavy model parameters through large-scale multi-source pre-training.
These models achieve superior generalization ability across various datasets at
the cost of significant computational burdens and limitations in
resource-constrained scenarios. This paper introduces LightGTS, a lightweight
general time series forecasting model designed from the perspective of
consistent periodical modeling. To handle diverse scales and intrinsic periods
in multi-source pre-training, we introduce Periodical Tokenization, which
extracts consistent periodic patterns across different datasets with varying
scales. To better utilize the periodicity in the decoding process, we further
introduce Periodical Parallel Decoding, which leverages historical tokens to
improve forecasting. Based on the two techniques above which fully leverage the
inductive bias of periods inherent in time series, LightGTS uses a lightweight
model to achieve outstanding performance on general time series forecasting. It
achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in
both zero-shot and full-shot settings with much better efficiency compared with
existing time series foundation models.

Conclusion: 显式建模更适合多固体系统，能避免信息混淆并提升性能。

Abstract: Multi-solid systems are foundational to a wide range of real-world
applications, yet modeling their complex interactions remains challenging.
Existing deep learning methods predominantly rely on implicit modeling, where
the factors influencing solid deformation are not explicitly represented but
are instead indirectly learned. However, as the number of solids increases,
these methods struggle to accurately capture intricate physical interactions.
In this paper, we introduce a novel explicit modeling paradigm that
incorporates factors influencing solid deformation through structured modules.
Specifically, we present Unisoma, a unified and flexible Transformer-based
model capable of handling variable numbers of solids. Unisoma directly captures
physical interactions using contact modules and adaptive interaction allocation
mechanism, and learns the deformation through a triplet relationship. Compared
to implicit modeling techniques, explicit modeling is more well-suited for
multi-solid systems with diverse coupling patterns, as it enables detailed
treatment of each solid while preventing information blending and confusion.
Experimentally, Unisoma achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across
seven well-established datasets and two complex multi-solid tasks. Code is

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需真实因果图即可准确估计因果效应，且在不同因果特征的数据集上具有可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PFNs在因果效应估计中表现出潜力，为无需强假设的因果推断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Estimation of causal effects is critical to a range of scientific
disciplines. Existing methods for this task either require interventional data,
knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions such as
unconfoundedness, restricting their applicability in real-world settings. In
the domain of tabular machine learning, Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have
achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, having been pre-trained on
synthetic data to solve tabular prediction problems via in-context learning. To
assess whether this can be transferred to the harder problem of causal effect
estimation, we pre-train PFNs on synthetic data drawn from a wide variety of
causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes
given observational data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic case
studies, we show that our approach allows for the accurate estimation of causal
effects without knowledge of the underlying causal graph. We also perform
ablation studies that elucidate Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across
datasets with a variety of causal characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基学习模拟器在捕捉全局现象（如弯曲或长程相关性）和长期误差累积上表现不佳，主要依赖局部消息传递和直接下一步预测。

Method: ROBIN结合了Rolling Diffusion（一种并行化推断方案）和基于代数多重网格粗化的层次图神经网络，实现了多尺度消息传递。

Result: 在2D和3D固体力学基准测试中，ROBIN在所有任务上达到最先进精度，显著优于现有学习模拟器，并将推断时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: ROBIN通过创新设计有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在精度和效率上均表现出色。

Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for
simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and
generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with
capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and
suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on
local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these
limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network
(ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i)
Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of
diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising
steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built
on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across
different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via
Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local
dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending
or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid
mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.
ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially
outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference
time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.

Motivation: 传统不确定性估计方法（如dropout）难以清晰区分可靠与不可靠预测，主要因分类器权重噪声影响细粒度统计信息。

Method: 提出一种测试时优化方法，考虑噪声影响以生成更可靠的置信度估计，定义单调子集选择函数。

Result: 在AUSE和AURC等风险指标中表现优异，能有效识别训练与测试分布差异及区分分布内外样本。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升置信度估计质量，并揭示了CNN与ViT分类器在视觉数据集中的关键差异。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Result: 理论分析了删除容量、准确性、内存和计算时间之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 系统感知遗忘定义更现实，算法高效且安全，适用于实际系统。

Abstract: Machine unlearning addresses the problem of updating a machine learning
model/system trained on a dataset $S$ so that the influence of a set of
deletion requests $U \subseteq S$ on the unlearned model is minimized. The gold
standard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after
deletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This
definition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only
the unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \setminus
U$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning
algorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In
this work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to
provide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain
access to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and
not all of $S\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple
intuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning
updates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a
system-aware attacker. Towards that end, we present an exact system-aware
unlearning algorithm for linear classification using a selective sampling-based
approach, and we generalize the method for classification with general function
classes. We theoretically analyze the tradeoffs between deletion capacity,
accuracy, memory, and computation time.

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful
understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating
Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.
Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.
However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse
Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of
mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address
the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates
optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion
on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the
multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and
determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The
experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF
achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end
inference.

Abstract: While Foundation Models provide a general tool for rapid content creation,
they regularly require task-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise
involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the
underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt
foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy
training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting
Large Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description
of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a
single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained
LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA
instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the
corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA
instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach
provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of
foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute
requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/text-to-lora

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of
machine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models
without full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)
are widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing
methods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via
online attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding
retraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to
capture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these
challenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a
framework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies
sample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's
generalization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong
performance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation
for approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow
model. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains
performance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning
algorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and
under-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate
unlearning systems. The code is available at

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection is critical for improving clustering

$k$-means++, a novel initialisation strategy for the Minkowski Weighted
$k$-means. Our initialisation selects centroids probabilistically using feature
relevance estimates derived from the data itself. Building on this, we propose
two new feature selection algorithms, FS-MWK++, which aggregates feature
weights across a range of Minkowski exponents to identify stable and
informative features, and SFS-MWK++, a scalable variant based on subsampling.
We support our approach with a theoretical guarantee under mild assumptions and
extensive experiments showing that our methods consistently outperform existing
alternatives.

to three primary user groups: tech pioneers aiming for cost-effective,
fault-tolerant large-scale training, developers requiring flexible control over
training workflows, and researchers seeking agile experimentation. ROLL is
built upon several key modules to serve these user groups effectively. First, a
single-controller architecture combined with an abstraction of the parallel
worker simplifies the development of the training pipeline. Second, the
parallel strategy and data transfer modules enable efficient and scalable
training. Third, the rollout scheduler offers fine-grained management of each
sample's lifecycle during the rollout stage. Fourth, the environment worker and
reward worker support rapid and flexible experimentation with agentic RL
algorithms and reward designs. Finally, AutoDeviceMapping allows users to
assign resources to different models flexibly across various stages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN未考虑流图数据中的守恒定律（如电力网络中的电流守恒），导致性能下降。

Method: 提出流注意力机制，改进现有图注意力机制以满足基尔霍夫第一定律。

Result: 实验表明，流注意力在电路和电网数据集上提升了图分类和回归任务的性能。

Conclusion: 流注意力机制有效解决了流图数据中的守恒问题，提升了模型表现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation
law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as
electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which
can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow
attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy
Kirchhoff\'s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification
influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can
be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through
extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power
grids), we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of
attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SAM-GS的新型梯度手术方法，通过梯度幅度相似性度量优化多任务深度学习中的梯度冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务深度学习（MTDL）中，任务梯度可能因幅度或方向不同而产生冲突，影响模型收敛。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SAM-GS方法，基于梯度幅度相似性度量，结合梯度均衡和一阶动量调制，优化梯度聚合。

Result: 实验证明SAM-GS在合成问题和MTL基准测试中有效，梯度幅度相似性对优化学习过程至关重要。

Conclusion: SAM-GS为MTDL中的梯度冲突问题提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

TL;DR: 论文提出Table-r1方法，通过程序化推理（P-TR）提升小语言模型（SLMs）在表格推理任务中的表现，解决了布局异构性和推理不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格推理（TR）对小语言模型（SLMs）具有挑战性，因其能力有限，尤其在数值推理方面。程序化推理（P-TR）可以弥补这一差距，但SLMs在应用P-TR时面临布局异构性和代码生成能力不足的问题。

Method: Table-r1采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过自监督学习任务（布局转换推理）提升表格布局泛化能力；第二阶段采用混合范式的Group Relative Policy Optimization，增强推理一致性并支持动态回退到文本推理（T-TR）。

Result: 在四个TR基准测试中，Table-r1显著优于其他SLM方法，准确率比基础模型（LLaMA-8B）提升至少15%，且性能接近大语言模型（LLMs）。

Conclusion: Table-r1通过创新的两阶段设计，有效提升了SLMs在表格推理任务中的表现，缩小了与LLMs的差距。

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Conclusion: CARPS是HPO评估标准化的重要进展，支持未来高效比较。

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is crucial to develop well-performing
machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO
methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated
Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark
tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important
types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and
multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark
collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to
library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies
on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and
benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the
evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of
tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.
To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the
star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a
result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task
type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become
available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of
baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps
(https://www.github.com/automl/CARP-S), we make an important step in the
standardization of HPO evaluation.

Result: ENMA能够泛化到新的PDE体系，并支持一次性替代建模。

Conclusion: ENMA提供了一个鲁棒且适应性强的框架，适用于时间依赖参数PDE的建模。

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a fundamental challenge for neural solvers, particularly when
generalizing across a wide range of physical parameters and dynamics. When data
is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn
to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed
to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA
predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked
autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise
generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform
latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through
a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context
learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target
trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result
is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and
supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These
methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient
ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy
gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.
Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve
efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as
previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received
substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of
$O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored
from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous
theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can
significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean
correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG
(Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new
trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under
established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We
further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with
state-of-the-art rates.

Conclusion: 自注意力在广泛领域中作为互交互学习器有效，新模块为多实体交互提供了更强大的建模工具。

Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural
architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper,
we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from
agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences,
and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent,
learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including
out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as
a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of
interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide
variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical
insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns
interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce
HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn
couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities.
Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond
pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way,
four-way, or general n-way interactions.

Result: 发现初始噪声的对称性，成功提升图像多样性和不确定性量化效果。

Conclusion: 提出了一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，显著提升了扩散模型的应用效果。

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion
models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets,
text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we
find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields
strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine
experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the
learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up
to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this
negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity
in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening
uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when
estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the
two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further
improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic,
and adds no runtime overhead.

Result: PINC模型准确模拟流动力学，支持实时控制，无需迭代求解器。

Conclusion: PINC为流体流动监测和优化提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: The modeling and control of single-phase flow systems governed by Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) present challenges, especially under transient
conditions. In this work, we extend the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for
Control (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to
the PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible
flows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC
model for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which
learns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a
transient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary
conditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality
of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the
efficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the
derivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We
validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the
PINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without
labeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control
applications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently
approximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a
promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering
applications.

Motivation: 患者分层对个性化医疗至关重要，ICU的EHR数据提供了丰富的时序信息，但缺乏标准化评估方法。

Method: 提出ICU-TSB基准，使用三种公开ICU数据集，结合统计方法和循环神经网络（如LSTM、GRU）生成患者表示并进行聚类。

Result: 时序表示学习能发现临床相关患者群体，但挑战仍存（v-measure最高0.46，最低0.40）。

Conclusion: ICU-TSB为患者分层提供了可复现的评估框架，并探索了聚类标签的可解释性。

Abstract: Patient stratification identifying clinically meaningful subgroups is
essential for advancing personalized medicine through improved diagnostics and
treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from
intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be
leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal
Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using
three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark
is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to
measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease
groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and
several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to
generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient
trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can
rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a
challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of
the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the
practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for
assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and
benchmark are fully reproducible and available at

Result: 发现现代架构的守恒定律可通过孤立分析构建块来表征，并在离散优化（如SGD）中仍适用。

Conclusion: 现代架构的守恒定律与浅层网络类似，且可通过构建块分析简化研究。

Abstract: While conservation laws in gradient flow training dynamics are well
understood for (mostly shallow) ReLU and linear networks, their study remains
largely unexplored for more practical architectures. This paper bridges this
gap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with
a focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first
show that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with
or without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more
than the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also
completely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks
have the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We
then introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of
parameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual
block, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of
such laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in
isolation. Finally, we examine how these newly discovered conservation
principles, initially established in the continuous gradient flow regime,
persist under discrete optimization dynamics, particularly in the context of
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Result: 模型在低保真稳态模拟中，训练步骤减少10倍，能量生产提升14%。

Conclusion: 这是首个能在时变风况下有效泛化的深度强化学习尾流转向控制器。

Abstract: Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce
overall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed
to mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering,
for example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the
wind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust
wake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning
approaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms.
This work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a
wake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces
a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head
self-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy.
The resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy
production in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on
steady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires
approximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural
network and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization
baseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering
controller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in
a low-fidelity, steady-state numerical simulation setting.

Conclusion: MGCL通过将生成模型融入图对比学习，显著提升了性能，证明了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{MGCL}$, a model-driven graph contrastive learning (GCL)
framework that leverages graphons (probabilistic generative models for graphs)
to guide contrastive learning by accounting for the data's underlying
generative process. GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated
labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented
views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various
downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing
methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation
strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and
operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs
generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first
estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a
graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled
augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset
and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared
semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.

Motivation: 自回归语言模型因其固定的从左到右的标记生成方式会累积错误，需要一种方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: RPT方法通过迭代重新访问和替换先前生成的文本来减少错误累积，同时保持模型的预测质量和速度。

Result: 在8B参数模型上仅用100B数据进行微调后，RPT在推理和编码基准测试中相比标准采样方法实现了约10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: RPT是一种有效的采样方法，能够显著减少自回归模型中的错误累积，提升性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Motivation: 深入了解抑郁症的神经认知基础，尤其是情绪和自我参照处理的核心功能如何受影响。

Method: 使用表面EEG测量健康与抑郁个体对自我参照情感句子的神经反应，并训练深度学习模型分析数据。

Result: 抑郁组在句子观看时神经活动显著不同，深度学习模型区分健康与抑郁的AUC为0.707，区分抑郁亚组的AUC为0.624。

Conclusion: 抑郁存在稳定的神经特征，可能为未来诊断工具提供依据。

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health
condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is
essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and
self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters
the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to
self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)
in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant
group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting
disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in
depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy
from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups
with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior
electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key
contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures
of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.

TL;DR: GLEP扩展了EP算法，使其适用于时变输入，并展示了不同边界条件下的学习算法。HEL是GLEP的特例，继承了EP的硬件友好特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EP算法在时变输入中的扩展问题，并探索其实际应用。

Method: 提出GLEP，通过变分描述扩展到系统轨迹，分析不同边界条件。

Result: GLEP生成多种学习算法，HEL是唯一具备硬件友好特性的特例。

Conclusion: GLEP为时变输入提供理论框架，HEL是实际可行的硬件实现方案。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm for training
Energy-based Models (EBMs) on static inputs which leverages the variational
description of their fixed points. Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a
challenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire
system trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of
boundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized
Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational
formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields
different learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the
system, many of which are impractical for implementation. We then show that
Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) -- which includes the recently proposed
Recurrent HEL (RHEL) and the earlier known Hamiltonian Echo Backpropagation
(HEB) algorithms -- can be derived as a special case of GLEP. Notably, HEL is
the only instance of GLEP we found that inherits the properties that make EP a
desirable alternative to backpropagation for hardware implementations: it
operates in a "forward-only" manner (i.e. using the same system for both
inference and learning), it scales efficiently (requiring only two or more
passes through the system regardless of model size), and enables local
learning.

TL;DR: 当前LLM的遗忘方法不够鲁棒，容易被微调恢复。研究发现蒸馏可以增强遗忘的鲁棒性，并提出了一种新方法UNDO，通过蒸馏部分噪声化的模型实现高效遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法容易被微调恢复，输出微调无法实现鲁棒遗忘。

Method: 提出UNDO方法，通过蒸馏部分噪声化的模型实现鲁棒遗忘，平衡计算成本和鲁棒性。

Result: UNDO在合成任务中匹配从头训练的鲁棒性，计算成本降低20-40%，仅需0.01%的标注数据。在WMDP基准测试中也表现良好。

Conclusion: 蒸馏结合遗忘步骤为实际应用提供了一种鲁棒的能力移除路径。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily
with a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning
method of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to
unwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient
to achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a
randomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired
behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,
distillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose
Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an
unlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a
tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto
frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,
UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data
filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of
the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies
unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)
benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an
unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability
removal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重矩阵的长宽比会影响重尾性度量的准确性，导致模型诊断和层间超参数分配不准确。

Method: 提出FARMS方法，通过固定长宽比的子矩阵采样，测量子矩阵的平均谱密度来消除长宽比偏差。

Result: FARMS在多种应用领域（如CV、SciML、LLM）中提升了谱分析的准确性，并在LLM剪枝实验中显著降低困惑度。

Conclusion: FARMS是一种简单有效的方法，能够消除长宽比偏差，提升模型诊断和超参数分配的准确性。

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) through the eigenspectrum of weight
matrices has been an active area of research in recent years. At a high level,
eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the
empirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into
how well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better
layer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge
associated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of
weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that
matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias
in estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose
FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the
weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead
of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD
of these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of
these submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the
aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization
techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of
weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,
scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model
(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly
improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of
the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model
by 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种辅助多智能体系统组织工程方法（AOMEA），通过结合多智能体强化学习（MARL）和组织模型，简化复杂环境下的MAS设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）在复杂分布式问题中表现优异，但其设计效率高度依赖部署环境的知识。复杂或低可读性的环境使得传统方法成本高或存在安全隐患。

Method: 提出AOMEA方法，结合MARL和组织模型，为MAS工程提供相关组织规范建议。

Result: AOMEA能够有效简化MAS组织设计，解决复杂环境下的成本和安全性问题。

Conclusion: AOMEA为复杂环境下的MAS设计提供了一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been successfully applied in industry for
their ability to address complex, distributed problems, especially in IoT-based
systems. Their efficiency in achieving given objectives and meeting design
requirements is strongly dependent on the MAS organization during the
engineering process of an application-specific MAS. To design a MAS that can
achieve given goals, available methods rely on the designer's knowledge of the
deployment environment. However, high complexity and low readability in some
deployment environments make the application of these methods to be costly or
raise safety concerns. In order to ease the MAS organization design regarding
those concerns, we introduce an original Assisted MAS Organization Engineering
Approach (AOMEA). AOMEA relies on combining a Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) process with an organizational model to suggest relevant
organizational specifications to help in MAS engineering.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的集中式方法（MAT-NAHT），用于解决N-agent ad hoc teamwork（NAHT）问题，优于现有独立学习方法（POAM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（POAM）仅采用独立学习，无法充分捕捉多智能体协作中的动态交互，而Transformer能有效处理变长序列，适用于多智能体协作问题。

Method: 提出集中式Transformer方法（MAT-NAHT），利用所有受控智能体的历史观察和动作，以应对部分可观测环境中未知队友的多样性。

Result: 在StarCraft II任务中，MAT-NAHT表现优于POAM，具有更高的样本效率和泛化能力，且无需额外建模目标。

Conclusion: MAT-NAHT通过集中式Transformer方法有效解决了NAHT问题，为多智能体协作提供了新思路。

Abstract: N-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT) is a newly introduced challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning, where controlled subteams of varying sizes must
dynamically collaborate with varying numbers and types of unknown teammates
without pre-coordination. The existing learning algorithm (POAM) considers only
independent learning for its flexibility in dealing with a changing number of
agents. However, independent learning fails to fully capture the inter-agent
dynamics essential for effective collaboration. Based on our observation that
transformers deal effectively with sequences with varying lengths and have been
shown to be highly effective for a variety of machine learning problems, this
work introduces a centralized, transformer-based method for N-agent ad hoc
teamwork. Our proposed approach incorporates historical observations and
actions of all controlled agents, enabling optimal responses to diverse and
unseen teammates in partially observable environments. Empirical evaluation on
a StarCraft II task demonstrates that MAT-NAHT outperforms POAM, achieving
superior sample efficiency and generalization, without auxiliary agent-modeling
objectives.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用生成式AI（如大型语言模型LLM）替代人类参与者，解决集体风险社会困境（CRSD）研究中大规模实验的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CRSD研究（如气候变化）需要大规模人类实验，但难以保证样本多样性和统计效力。生成式AI提供了一种补充方法。

Method: 通过使用LLM模拟人类参与者，构建一个可扩展的实证框架，验证其在大规模CRSD实验中的有效性。

Result: 研究发现LLM可以模拟具有足够多样性的人类实验，特别是在复杂的CRSD场景（如Port of Mars）中。

Conclusion: 生成式AI为CRSD研究提供了可行的替代方案，能够弥补人类实验的局限性。

Abstract: Collective risk social dilemmas (CRSD) highlight a trade-off between
individual preferences and the need for all to contribute toward achieving a
group objective. Problems such as climate change are in this category, and so
it is critical to understand their social underpinnings. However, rigorous CRSD
methodology often demands large-scale human experiments but it is difficult to
guarantee sufficient power and heterogeneity over socio-demographic factors.
Generative AI offers a potential complementary approach to address thisproblem.
By replacing human participants with large language models (LLM), it allows for
a scalable empirical framework. This paper focuses on the validity of this
approach and whether it is feasible to represent a large-scale human-like
experiment with sufficient diversity using LLM. In particular, where previous
literature has focused on political surveys, virtual towns and classical
game-theoretic examples, we focus on a complex CRSD used in the institutional
economics and sustainability literature known as Port of Mars

Result: 人类和AI在可识别条件下表现更好，均通过轮流解决问题。

Conclusion: 多智能体强化学习是模拟复杂社会行为的有效工具。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are useful for simulating
social behavior in settings that are too complex for other theoretical
approaches like game theory. However, they have not yet been empirically
supported by laboratory experiments with real human participants. In this work
we demonstrate how multi-agent reinforcement learning can model group behavior
in a spatially and temporally complex public good provision game called Clean
Up. We show that human groups succeed in Clean Up when they can see who is who
and track reputations over time but fail under conditions of anonymity. A new
multi-agent reinforcement learning model of reputation-based cooperation
demonstrates the same difference between identifiable and anonymous conditions.
Furthermore, both human groups and artificial agent groups solve the problem
via turn-taking despite other options being available. Our results highlight
the benefits of using multi-agent reinforcement learning to model human social
behavior in complex environments.

Method: 比较了多种预处理方法对忆阻RC系统的影响，并提出了一种新的奇偶校验预处理方法。

Result: 提出的方法将准确率提升了2-6%，且设备数量增加较少。

Conclusion: 预处理策略对忆阻RC系统的效率和可扩展性至关重要。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent
neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its
last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors,
RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for
reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based
RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing
method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation
that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper
systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC
systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also
propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6%
while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other
methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing
strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了SNNs的性能和能量效率，使其在相同架构下达到或超越ANNs的表现。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and
energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the
limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking
neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to
exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons
with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and
maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual
timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve
the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high
integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs,
achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on
COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6%

Motivation: ENAS的理论研究尚不成熟，尤其是在多元分类问题上的运行时分析缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 提出基准和两级搜索空间设计，分析(1+1)-ENAS算法在两种变异操作下的运行时上下界。

Result: 证明算法在两种变异操作下的运行时上界为O(rMln{rM})，下界为Ω(rMln{M})，支持简单单比特变异的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明简单单比特变异在ENAS中具有潜力，为理论研究和实际应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) is a key part of evolutionary
machine learning, which commonly utilizes evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to
automatically design high-performing deep neural architectures. During past
years, various ENAS methods have been proposed with exceptional performance.
However, the theory research of ENAS is still in the infant. In this work, we
step for the runtime analysis, which is an essential theory aspect of EAs, of
ENAS upon multiclass classification problems. Specifically, we first propose a
benchmark to lay the groundwork for the analysis. Furthermore, we design a
two-level search space, making it suitable for multiclass classification
problems and consistent with the common settings of ENAS. Based on both
designs, we consider (1+1)-ENAS algorithms with one-bit and bit-wise mutations,
and analyze their upper and lower bounds on the expected runtime. We prove that
the algorithm using both mutations can find the optimum with the expected
runtime upper bound of $O(rM\ln{rM})$ and lower bound of $\Omega(rM\ln{M})$.
This suggests that a simple one-bit mutation may be greatly considered, given
that most state-of-the-art ENAS methods are laboriously designed with the
bit-wise mutation. Empirical studies also support our theoretical proof.

Result: LB模型准确率超过90%，LIF模型达85%以上，最高准确率98.25%，计算成本降低100倍。

Conclusion: SNN与LZC结合为医学诊断提供了高效且生物合理的替代方案，特别适合资源受限或实时系统。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) event-driven nature enables efficient encoding
of spatial and temporal features, making them suitable for dynamic
time-dependent data processing. Despite their biological relevance, SNNs have
seen limited application in medical image recognition due to difficulties in
matching the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this,
we propose a novel breast cancer classification approach that combines SNNs
with Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) a computationally efficient measure of
sequence complexity. LZC enhances the interpretability and accuracy of
spike-based models by capturing structural patterns in neural activity. Our
study explores both biophysical Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and
probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neuron models under supervised, unsupervised,
and hybrid learning regimes. Experiments were conducted on the Breast Cancer
Wisconsin dataset using numerical features derived from medical imaging.
LB-based models consistently exceeded 90.00% accuracy, while LIF-based models
reached over 85.00%. The highest accuracy of 98.25% was achieved using an
ANN-to-SNN conversion method applied to both neuron models comparable to
traditional deep learning with back-propagation, but at up to 100 times lower
computational cost. This hybrid approach merges deep learning performance with
the efficiency and plausibility of SNNs, yielding top results at lower
computational cost. We hypothesize that the synergy between temporal-coding,
spike-sparsity, and LZC-driven complexity analysis enables more-efficient
feature extraction. Our findings demonstrate that SNNs combined with LZC offer
promising, biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural networks
in medical diagnostics, particularly for resource-constrained or real-time
systems.

Motivation: 传统说话人日志方法在处理变长说话人数量和训练引导方面存在不足，需要更精细的说话人属性表示。

Method: 扩展了Encoder-Decoder Attractors（EDA）方法，引入多阶段中间表示，并用Conformer替代Transformer以建模局部依赖。

Result: 在CALLHOME数据集上表现出更好的说话人日志性能。

Conclusion: 通过多阶段表示和Conformer架构，显著提升了说话人日志的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end approaches have made notable progress in
addressing the challenge of speaker diarization, which involves segmenting and
identifying speakers in multi-talker recordings. One such approach,
Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA), has been proposed to handle variable speaker
counts as well as better guide the network during training. In this study, we
extend the attractor paradigm by moving beyond direct speaker modeling and
instead focus on representing more detailed `speaker attributes' through a
multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, we enhance
the architecture by replacing transformers with conformers, a
convolution-augmented transformer, to model local dependencies. Experiments
demonstrate improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

Motivation: 语音中的副语言/非语言信息对听众印象至关重要，但现有零样本TTS难以精确控制这些信息。

Method: 使用低维向量表示语音印象对的强度，并通过大语言模型从自然语言描述生成目标印象向量。

Result: 主客观评估验证了该方法在印象控制上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动优化即可实现目标印象生成。

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

Abstract: As deep learning advances in audio generation, challenges in audio security
and copyright protection highlight the need for robust audio watermarking.
Recent neural network-based methods have made progress but still face three
main issues: preventing unauthorized access, decoding initial watermarks after
multiple embeddings, and embedding varying lengths of watermarks. To address
these issues, we propose WAKE, the first key-controllable audio watermark
framework. WAKE embeds watermarks using specific keys and recovers them with
corresponding keys, enhancing security by making incorrect key decoding
impossible. It also resolves the overwriting issue by allowing watermark
decoding after multiple embeddings and supports variable-length watermark
insertion. WAKE outperforms existing models in both watermarked audio quality
and watermark detection accuracy. Code, more results, and demo page:

introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment
challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport
regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal
audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text
encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal
modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is
predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional
sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss
further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the
MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the
baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA.
Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the
largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance
of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示的新方法Neural Acoustic Transfer，用于实时预测动态变化环境中的声场，解决了传统方法在复杂场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声学传输方法依赖大量预计算和存储，难以应对动态变化的物体位置、材质和尺寸对声效的影响。

Method: 利用隐式神经表示编码预计算的声学传输及其变化，结合快速蒙特卡洛边界元方法（BEM）和GPU加速的标准BEM生成训练数据。

Result: 方法在数值精度和运行效率上表现优异（30秒音频仅需几毫秒），适用于动态环境中的声学建模。

Conclusion: 该方法为虚拟现实、增强现实等交互应用提供了高效准确的声学建模解决方案。

Abstract: Previous acoustic transfer methods rely on extensive precomputation and
storage of data to enable real-time interaction and auditory feedback. However,
these methods struggle with complex scenes, especially when dynamic changes in
object position, material, and size significantly alter sound effects. These
continuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions,
making it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render
efficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic
Transfer, a novel approach that utilizes an implicit neural representation to
encode precomputed acoustic transfer and its variations, allowing for real-time
prediction of sound fields under varying conditions. To efficiently generate
the training data required for the neural acoustic field, we developed a fast
Monte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation for general
scenarios with smooth Neumann conditions. Additionally, we implemented a
GPU-accelerated version of standard BEM for scenarios requiring higher
precision. These methods provide the necessary training data, enabling our
neural network to accurately model the sound radiation space. We demonstrate
our method's numerical accuracy and runtime efficiency (within several
milliseconds for 30s audio) through comprehensive validation and comparisons in
diverse acoustic transfer scenarios. Our approach allows for efficient and
accurate modeling of sound behavior in dynamically changing environments, which
can benefit a wide range of interactive applications such as virtual reality,
augmented reality, and advanced audio production.

TL;DR: 论文研究了CTC（连接时序分类）中隐含的上下文依赖性，提出了基于知识蒸馏的上下文相关内部语言模型估计方法，并通过实验验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CTC假设标签上下文独立，但现代强大编码器可能使其隐含学习上下文相关的内部语言模型（ILM）。本文旨在探究CTC中ILM的上下文依赖性。

Method: 提出了基于知识蒸馏（KD）的上下文相关ILM估计方法，并引入两种正则化方法。实验在Librispeech和TED-LIUM Release 2数据集上进行。

Result: 实验表明，上下文相关ILM在跨域评估中优于上下文无关先验，且提出的标签级KD平滑方法在词错误率上比浅融合提升超过13%。

Conclusion: CTC确实学习了上下文相关的ILM，且提出的方法在性能上显著优于其他ILM估计方法。

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical
deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs
with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods
relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards
often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a
learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and
curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery
maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic
architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in
simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against
uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination
reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization
through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct
quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%
without platform-specific tuning. The supplementary material is available at

Motivation: 现有TOG数据集多为合成或标注不完整，限制了模型性能。同时，缺乏适应新对象的解决方案。

Method: 提出TD-TOG数据集（1,449真实RGB-D场景，完整标注）和Binary-TOG框架（零样本对象识别，一样本功能识别）。

Result: Binary-TOG在多对象场景中任务抓取准确率达68.9%。

Conclusion: TD-TOG和Binary-TOG填补了数据集和模型适应性空白，为零样本和一样本学习在TOG中的应用提供了参考。

Abstract: Task-oriented grasping (TOG) is an essential preliminary step for robotic
task execution, which involves predicting grasps on regions of target objects
that facilitate intended tasks. Existing literature reveals there is a limited
availability of TOG datasets for training and benchmarking despite large
demand, which are often synthetic or have artifacts in mask annotations that
hinder model performance. Moreover, TOG solutions often require affordance
masks, grasps, and object masks for training, however, existing datasets
typically provide only a subset of these annotations. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Top-down Task-oriented Grasping (TD-TOG) dataset,
designed to train and evaluate TOG solutions. TD-TOG comprises 1,449 real-world
RGB-D scenes including 30 object categories and 120 subcategories, with
hand-annotated object masks, affordances, and planar rectangular grasps. It
also features a test set for a novel challenge that assesses a TOG solution's
ability to distinguish between object subcategories. To contribute to the
demand for TOG solutions that can adapt and manipulate previously unseen
objects without re-training, we propose a novel TOG framework, Binary-TOG.
Binary-TOG uses zero-shot for object recognition, and one-shot learning for
affordance recognition. Zero-shot learning enables Binary-TOG to identify
objects in multi-object scenes through textual prompts, eliminating the need
for visual references. In multi-object settings, Binary-TOG achieves an average
task-oriented grasp accuracy of 68.9%. Lastly, this paper contributes a
comparative analysis between one-shot and zero-shot learning for object
generalization in TOG to be used in the development of future TOG solutions.

Abstract: Traditional soil sampling and analysis methods are labor-intensive,
time-consuming, and limited in spatial resolution, making them unsuitable for
large-scale precision agriculture. To address these limitations, we present a

Analysis Lab (Lab) for real-time soil property analysis. The system's
performance was validated through extensive field trials at a large-scale
Australian farm. Experimental results show that the SAS can consistently
acquire soil samples with a mass of 50g at a depth of 200mm, while the Lab can
process each sample within 10 minutes to accurately measure pH and
macronutrients. These results demonstrate the potential of the system to
provide farmers with timely, data-driven insights for more efficient and
sustainable soil management and fertilizer application.

Abstract: Apples are among the most widely consumed fruits worldwide. Currently, apple
harvesting fully relies on manual labor, which is costly, drudging, and
hazardous to workers. Hence, robotic harvesting has attracted increasing
attention in recent years. However, existing systems still fall short in terms
of performance, effectiveness, and reliability for complex orchard
environments. In this work, we present the development and evaluation of a
dual-arm harvesting robot. The system integrates a ToF camera, two 4DOF robotic
arms, a centralized vacuum system, and a post-harvest handling module. During
harvesting, suction force is dynamically assigned to either arm via the vacuum
system, enabling efficient apple detachment while reducing power consumption
and noise. Compared to our previous design, we incorporated a platform movement
mechanism that enables both in-out and up-down adjustments, enhancing the
robot's dexterity and adaptability to varying canopy structures. On the
algorithmic side, we developed a robust apple localization pipeline that
combines a foundation-model-based detector, segmentation, and clustering-based
depth estimation, which improves performance in orchards. Additionally,
pressure sensors were integrated into the system, and a novel dual-arm
coordination strategy was introduced to respond to harvest failures based on
sensor feedback, further improving picking efficiency. Field demos were
conducted in two commercial orchards in MI, USA, with different canopy
structures. The system achieved success rates of 0.807 and 0.797, with an
average picking cycle time of 5.97s. The proposed strategy reduced harvest time
by 28% compared to a single-arm baseline. The dual-arm harvesting robot
enhances the reliability and efficiency of apple picking. With further
advancements, the system holds strong potential for autonomous operation and
commercialization for the apple industry.

Conclusion: SMA丝的引入显著提升了软机器人模块的性能，实现了更高效和精确的控制。

Abstract: In this paper, a compressed air-actuated soft robotic module was developed by
incorporating a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire into its structure to achieve the
desired bending angle with greater precision. First, a fiber-reinforced bending
module with a strain-limiting layer made of polypropylene was fabricated. The
SMA wire was then placed in a silicon matrix, which was used as a new
strain-limiting layer. A simple closed-loop control algorithm was used to
regulate the bending angle of the soft robot within its workspace. A camera was
utilized to measure the angular changes in the vertical plane. Different
angles, ranging from 0 to 65 degrees, were covered to evaluate the performance
of the module and the bending angle control algorithm. The experimental tests
demonstrate that using the SMA wire results in more precise control of bending
in the vertical plane. In addition, it is possible to bend more with less
working pressure. The error range was reduced from an average of 5 degrees to 2
degrees, and the rise time was reduced from an average of 19 seconds to 3
seconds.

Motivation: 模仿学习需要大量演示数据，成本高昂。利用人类演示者的认知能力（如注视行为）提取任务相关线索是一种潜在解决方案，但演示设备可能影响注视行为。

Method: 提出实验框架，系统分析不同演示设备下演示者的注视行为。

Conclusion: 演示设备的设计对模仿学习的效果至关重要，自然人类行为数据能显著提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Imitation learning for acquiring generalizable policies often requires a
large volume of demonstration data, making the process significantly costly.
One promising strategy to address this challenge is to leverage the cognitive
and decision-making skills of human demonstrators with strong generalization
capability, particularly by extracting task-relevant cues from their gaze
behavior. However, imitation learning typically involves humans collecting data
using demonstration devices that emulate a robot's embodiment and visual
condition. This raises the question of how such devices influence gaze
behavior. We propose an experimental framework that systematically analyzes
demonstrators' gaze behavior across a spectrum of demonstration devices. Our
experimental results indicate that devices emulating (1) a robot's embodiment
or (2) visual condition impair demonstrators' capability to extract
task-relevant cues via gaze behavior, with the extent of impairment depending
on the degree of emulation. Additionally, gaze data collected using devices
that capture natural human behavior improves the policy's task success rate
from 18.8% to 68.8% under environmental shifts.

Abstract: In post-disaster scenarios, rapid and efficient delivery of medical resources

efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
(CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster
environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the
overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional
strategies, showing substantial reductions in total mission completion time and
traveled distance. Additionally, the cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs
effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system' s

Conclusion: 提出的方法在部分可观测环境下高效且鲁棒，适用于复杂几何和噪声环境。

Abstract: We study the problem of peeling a Velcro strap from a surface using a robotic
manipulator. The surface geometry is arbitrary and unknown. The robot has
access to only the force feedback and its end-effector position. This problem
is challenging due to the partial observability of the environment and the
incompleteness of the sensor feedback. To solve it, we first model the system
with simple analytic state and action models based on quasi-static dynamics
assumptions. We then study the fully-observable case where the state of both
the Velcro and the robot are given. For this case, we obtain the optimal
solution in closed-form which minimizes the total energy cost. Next, for the
partially-observable case, we design a state estimator which estimates the
underlying state using only force and position feedback. Then, we present a
heuristics-based controller that balances exploratory and exploitative
behaviors in order to peel the velcro efficiently. Finally, we evaluate our
proposed method in environments with complex geometric uncertainties and sensor
noises, achieving 100% success rate with less than 80% increase in energy cost
compared to the optimal solution when the environment is fully-observable,
outperforming the baselines by a large margin.

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了零样本目标导航的性能和效率。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in robot navigation, especially with end-to-end learning
approaches like reinforcement learning (RL), have shown remarkable efficiency
and effectiveness. Yet, successful navigation still relies on two key
capabilities: mapping and planning, whether explicit or implicit. Classical
approaches use explicit mapping pipelines to register ego-centric observations
into a coherent map frame for the planner. In contrast, end-to-end learning
achieves this implicitly, often through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that
fuse current and past observations into a latent space for planning. While
architectures such as LSTM and GRU capture temporal dependencies, our findings
reveal a key limitation: their inability to perform effective spatial
memorization. This skill is essential for transforming and integrating
sequential observations from varying perspectives to build spatial
representations that support downstream planning. To address this, we propose
Spatially-Enhanced Recurrent Units (SRUs), a simple yet effective modification
to existing RNNs, designed to enhance spatial memorization capabilities. We
introduce an attention-based architecture with SRUs, enabling long-range
navigation using a single forward-facing stereo camera. Regularization
techniques are employed to ensure robust end-to-end recurrent training via RL.
Experimental results show our approach improves long-range navigation by 23.5%
compared to existing RNNs. Furthermore, with SRU memory, our method outperforms
the RL baseline with explicit mapping and memory modules, achieving a 29.6%
improvement in diverse environments requiring long-horizon mapping and
memorization. Finally, we address the sim-to-real gap by leveraging large-scale
pretraining on synthetic depth data, enabling zero-shot transfer to diverse and
complex real-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is
essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of
infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising
solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature
monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban
environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance,
coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we
propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO)
algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal
screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex
optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing
trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum
screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency
compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides
critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient
multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas. For reader

TL;DR: BEAST是一种新型动作标记器，使用B样条编码动作序列为紧凑的离散或连续标记，无需单独训练标记器，支持并行解码生成平滑轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作标记器（如向量量化或字节对编码）需要单独训练且标记长度不一致，BEAST旨在解决这些问题，同时生成平滑轨迹。

Method: BEAST利用B样条编码动作序列，支持连续或离散标记，并与三种模型架构（VAE、Transformer、Florence-2）集成验证其兼容性。

Result: 在166个模拟任务和8个真实任务中，BEAST显著降低计算成本，生成平滑控制信号，并达到与先进方法竞争的任务成功率。

Conclusion: BEAST是一种高效、兼容性强且性能优越的动作标记器，适用于连续控制任务。

Abstract: We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel
action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or
continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers
based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate
tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling
fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline
formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without
discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by
integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with
discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an
encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and
scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three
established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct
robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference
computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency
control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably
achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 研究使用深度强化学习（DRL）和PPO算法训练控制器，优化四轮独立驱动电动赛车在极限操控下的性能，超越传统物理模型方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车辆动力学控制（VDC）方法依赖复杂物理模型，难以适应极限操控需求，而DRL提供了一种自适应、高性能的替代方案。

Method: 采用PPO算法训练端到端策略，直接映射车辆状态（如速度、加速度、横摆角速度）到转向角和四轮独立扭矩指令。

Result: 仿真显示，RL控制器能动态优化扭矩分配，提升操控性并减少转向不足，性能接近或超越传统物理模型控制器。

Conclusion: DRL在复杂车辆动力学控制中具有潜力，为自动驾驶在极限场景（如赛车和道路安全）提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controlling autonomous vehicles at their handling limits is a significant
challenge, particularly for electric vehicles with active four wheel drive
(A4WD) systems offering independent wheel torque control. While traditional
Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) methods use complex physics-based models, this
study explores Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop a unified,
high-performance controller. We employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm to train an agent for optimal lap times in a simulated racecar
(TORCS) at the tire grip limit. Critically, the agent learns an end-to-end
policy that directly maps vehicle states, like velocities, accelerations, and
yaw rate, to a steering angle command and independent torque commands for each
of the four wheels. This formulation bypasses conventional pedal inputs and
explicit torque vectoring algorithms, allowing the agent to implicitly learn
the A4WD control logic needed for maximizing performance and stability.
Simulation results demonstrate the RL agent learns sophisticated strategies,
dynamically optimizing wheel torque distribution corner-by-corner to enhance
handling and mitigate the vehicle's inherent understeer. The learned behaviors
mimic and, in aspects of grip utilization, potentially surpass traditional
physics-based A4WD controllers while achieving competitive lap times. This
research underscores DRL's potential to create adaptive control systems for
complex vehicle dynamics, suggesting RL is a potent alternative for advancing
autonomous driving in demanding, grip-limited scenarios for racing and road
safety.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的快速重规划算法，用于解决多自主机器人在动态环境中的任务分配问题，性能接近最优解且运行速度显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主机器人在远程动态环境中执行任务时，需要快速重规划能力以应对通信受限或中断的情况，现有方法无法满足多代理协作和任务动态调整的需求。

Method: 提出了一种基于图注意力网络和注意力模型的编码器/解码器模型，用于解决新型协作任务重规划问题（多TSP变体）。

Result: 在树莓派上运行时，算法性能接近最优解（90%情况下误差在10%以内），且速度比现有LKH3启发式求解器快85-370倍。

Conclusion: 该研究为多自主机器人系统在动态环境中的高效协作和任务重规划提供了可行方案，增强了系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for
executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime
domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous
environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile
or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning
algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning
shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when
formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)
are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;
2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with
variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board
deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a
novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and
develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and
Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple
example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the
time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic
solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves
the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: PyGemini是一个Python原生框架，旨在统一海上自主开发，解决当前工具碎片化问题，提供模块化、可维护和可扩展的软件架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前海上自主开发的工具碎片化，导致跨学科协作困难，性能瓶颈和持续集成支持不足，亟需统一解决方案。

Method: 引入PyGemini框架，采用配置驱动开发（CDD）结合行为驱动开发（BDD）、数据导向设计和容器化技术。

Result: PyGemini支持多种应用场景（独立应用、云服务、嵌入式库），并提供了3D内容生成、场景生成和生成式AI工具。

Conclusion: PyGemini为未来海上机器人研究提供了可扩展、高性能的基础框架。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and certifiability of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs)
requires robust decision-making systems, supported by extensive simulation,
testing, and validation across a broad range of scenarios. However, the current
landscape of maritime autonomy development is fragmented -- relying on
disparate tools for communication, simulation, monitoring, and system
integration -- which hampers interdisciplinary collaboration and inhibits the
creation of compelling assurance cases, demanded by insurers and regulatory
bodies. Furthermore, these disjointed tools often suffer from performance
bottlenecks, vendor lock-in, and limited support for continuous integration
workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce PyGemini, a permissively
licensed, Python-native framework that builds on the legacy of Autoferry Gemini
to unify maritime autonomy development. PyGemini introduces a novel
Configuration-Driven Development (CDD) process that fuses Behavior-Driven
Development (BDD), data-oriented design, and containerization to support
modular, maintainable, and scalable software architectures. The framework
functions as a stand-alone application, cloud-based service, or embedded
library -- ensuring flexibility across research and operational contexts. We
demonstrate its versatility through a suite of maritime tools -- including 3D
content generation for simulation and monitoring, scenario generation for
autonomy validation and training, and generative artificial intelligence
pipelines for augmenting imagery -- thereby offering a scalable, maintainable,
and performance-oriented foundation for future maritime robotics and autonomy
research.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how spatially grounded auxiliary representations
can provide both broad, high-level grounding as well as direct, actionable
information to improve policy learning performance and generalization for
dexterous tasks. We study these mid-level representations across three critical
dimensions: object-centricity, pose-awareness, and depth-awareness. We use
these interpretable mid-level representations to train specialist encoders via
supervised learning, then feed them as inputs to a diffusion policy to solve
dexterous bimanual manipulation tasks in the real world. We propose a novel
mixture-of-experts policy architecture that combines multiple specialized
expert models, each trained on a distinct mid-level representation, to improve
policy generalization. This method achieves an average success rate that is 11%
higher than a language-grounded baseline and 24 percent higher than a standard
diffusion policy baseline on our evaluation tasks. Furthermore, we find that
leveraging mid-level representations as supervision signals for policy actions
within a weighted imitation learning algorithm improves the precision with
which the policy follows these representations, yielding an additional
performance increase of 10%. Our findings highlight the importance of grounding
robot policies not only with broad perceptual tasks but also with more
granular, actionable representations. For further information and videos,

Conclusion: 3D光流世界模型为机器人操作任务提供了一种统一的、跨硬件的解决方案，显著提升了泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can
effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup
on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for
teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot
action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot
to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within
diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find
that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical
clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for
both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow
world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts
the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action
planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical
flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect
pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics
from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on
language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a
flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and
leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task
description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.
Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an
optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without
hardware-specific training.

Abstract: Modern robot navigation systems encounter difficulties in diverse and complex
indoor environments. Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small
models or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To
address this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture,
Astra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a
multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal
localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and
outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a
multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D
spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates
robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow
matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for
generating local trajectories, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor
inputs via a transformer encoder to predict the relative pose of the robot.
Deployed on real in-house mobile robots, Astra achieves high end-to-end mission
success rate across diverse indoor environments.

Abstract: Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a
crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various
assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into
their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly
challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping,
assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied
fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of
point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in
geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the
evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce
a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both
previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂动态环境中具有高效性和反应性，适用于自动驾驶车辆等应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for robot navigation in challenging
dynamic environments. The proposed method builds upon the concept of Velocity
Obstacles (VO) that was later extended to Nonlinear Velocity Obstacles (NLVO)
to account for obstacles moving along nonlinear trajectories. The NLVO is
extended in this paper to Acceleration Obstacles (AO) and Nonlinear
Acceleration Obstacles (NAO) that account for velocity and acceleration
constraints. Multi-robot navigation is achieved by using the same avoidance
algorithm by all robots. At each time step, the trajectories of all robots are
predicted based on their current velocity and acceleration to allow the
computation of their respective NLVO, AO and NAO.
  The introduction of AO and NAO allows the generation of safe avoidance
maneuvers that account for the robot dynamic constraints better than could be
done with the NLVO alone. This paper demonstrates the use of AO and NAO for
robot navigation in challenging environments. It is shown that using AO and NAO
enables simultaneous real-time collision avoidance while accounting for robot
kinematics and a direct consideration of its dynamic constraints. The presented
approach enables reactive and efficient navigation, with potential application
for autonomous vehicles operating in complex dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper investigates the environmental impact of Li-Ion batteries by
quantifying manufacturing-related emissions and analyzing how electricity mix
and production scale affect emission intensity. To this end, we conduct a
meta-analysis of life cycle assessments on lithium-ion batteries published over
the past two decades, categorizing them by year, battery chemistry, functional
unit, system boundaries, and electricity mix. We then carry out a
cradle-to-gate assessment for a nickel manganese cobalt 811 battery with a
silicon-coated graphite anode, analyzing how variations in the carbon intensity
of the electricity mix affect emissions, with case studies for China, South
Korea, and Sweden. Finally, we develop a set of regression models that link
annual battery production and the carbon intensity of China's electricity mix
to the average mass-specific emissions observed each year. The meta-analysis
shows a median global warming potential of 17.63 kg CO2-eq./kg of battery, with
a standard deviation of 7.34. Differences in electricity mix mainly influence
emissions from the energy-intensive cell production, particularly from cathode
material processing. We found that a multivariate linear regression using
production volume and the carbon intensity of the Chinese electricity mix as
predictors explains emissions with moderate accuracy. The environmental impact
of battery manufacturing can be reduced by using clean energy sources in
production processes. However, achieving substantial reductions requires clean
energy throughout the entire supply chain, as importing materials from regions
with carbon-intensive electricity mixes can undermine these efforts. Our
findings also highlight the emission-reducing effect of learning associated
with increased production scale, supporting the integration of learning effects
in future life cycle assessment models.

Conclusion: 论文提出的几何改进EKF在流形上的性能更优，为状态估计问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state
estimation problems over the past sixty years. The classical formulation of the
EKF is posed for nonlinear systems defined on global Euclidean spaces. The
design methodology is regularly applied to systems on smooth manifolds by
choosing local coordinates, however, it is well known that this approach is not
intrinsic to the manifold and performance depends heavily on choosing 'good'
coordinates. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filter that is
adapted to the specific geometry of the manifold in question. We show that an
affine connection and the concepts of parallel transport, torsion, and
curvature are the key geometric structures that allow the formulation of a
suitable family of intrinsic Gaussian-like distributions and provide the tools
to understand how to propagate state estimates and fuse measurements. This
leads us to propose novel geometric modifications to the propagation and update
steps of the EKF and revisit recent work on the geometry of the reset step. The
relative performance of the proposed geometric modifications are benchmarked
against classical EKF and iterated EKF algorithms on a simplified inertial
navigation system with direct pose measurements and no bias.

Abstract: This paper proposes a guidance strategy to achieve time-constrained
interception of stationary targets, taking into account both the bounded
field-of-view (FOV) of seeker-equipped interceptors and the actuator's physical
constraints. Actuator saturation presents a significant challenge in real-world
systems, often resulting in degraded performance. However, since these
limitations are typically known in advance, incorporating them into the
guidance design can enhance overall performance. To address the FOV constraint,
a time-to-go error-based approach is adopted. Furthermore, to incorporate the
lateral acceleration constraints, the engagement kinematics are augmented with
an input saturation model. Subsequently, the guidance strategy that constrains
the lateral acceleration and the time-to-go values within their respective
bounds is derived using Lyapunov stability concepts and the backstepping
technique. Furthermore, a multi-stage approach is suggested to expand the
achievable range of impact time. Numerical simulations are performed to
validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme for different initial engagement
geometries.

Abstract: This work investigates covert communication in a rate-splitting multiple
access (RSMA)-based multi-user multiple-input single-output system, where the
random locations of the wardens follow a homogeneous Poisson point process. To
demonstrate practical deployment scenarios, imperfect channel state information
at the transmitter is considered. Closed-form expressions for the statistics of
the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, along with the analytical
formulations for the covertness constraint, outage probability, and effective
covert throughput (ECT), are derived. Subsequently, an ECT maximization problem
is formulated under covertness and power allocation constraints. This
optimization problem is addressed using an alternating optimization-assisted
genetic algorithm (AO-GA). Simulation results corroborate the theoretical
analysis and demonstrate the superiority of RSMA over conventional multiple
access schemes, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed AO-GA.

Motivation: 随着淡水需求增加，污水处理厂的优化运行变得至关重要，但大量历史数据难以被管理者直接理解和利用。

Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater
demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return
of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore,
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on
these serious challenges.
  WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve
their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases
of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a
large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant
managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to
know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the
intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that
need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable
and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance.
  Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is
proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service
knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which
is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council
of Valladolid (Castilla y Le\'on, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of
XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize
a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes
of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and
facility units involved in each case.

Conclusion: EqF在航天应用中具有实际可行性，能够满足姿态和角速度估计的需求。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative attitude and angular velocity between two
rigid bodies is fundamental in aerospace applications such as spacecraft
rendezvous and docking. In these scenarios, a chaser vehicle must determine the
orientation and angular velocity of a target object using onboard sensors. This
work addresses the challenge of designing an Equivariant Filter (EqF) that can
reliably estimate both the relative attitude and the target angular velocity
using noisy observations of two known, non-collinear vectors fixed in the
target frame. To derive the EqF, a symmetry for the system is proposed and an
equivariant lift onto the symmetry group is calculated. Observability and
convergence properties are analyzed. Simulations demonstrate the filter's
performance, with Monte Carlo runs yielding statistically significant results.
The impact of low-rate measurements is also examined and a strategy to mitigate
this effect is proposed. Experimental results, using fiducial markers and both
conventional and event cameras for measurement acquisition, further validate
the approach, confirming its effectiveness in a realistic setting.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of trajectory optimization for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing time-sensitive medical deliveries in urban
environments. Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom
dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with
a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using
Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of
spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as
3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex
Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics,
STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex
optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently
using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free
trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and
reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time capable algorithm for the learning of
Gaussian Processes (GP) for submodels. It extends an existing recursive
Gaussian Process (RGP) algorithm which requires a measurable output. In many
applications, however, an envisaged GP output is not directly measurable.
Therefore, we present the integration of an RGP into an Extended Kalman Filter
(EKF) for the combined state estimation and GP learning. The algorithm is
successfully tested in simulation studies and outperforms two alternative
implementations -- especially if high measurement noise is present. We conclude
the paper with an experimental validation within the control structure of a
Vapor Compression Cycle typically used in refrigeration and heat pumps. In this
application, the algorithm is used to learn a GP model for the heat-transfer
values in dependency of several process parameters. The GP model significantly
improves the tracking performance of a previously published model-based
controller.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了数据驱动的非线性输出调节问题，并通过数值示例验证了其性能。

Abstract: This work proposes a data-driven regulator design that drives the output of a
nonlinear system asymptotically to a time-varying reference and rejects
time-varying disturbances. The key idea is to design a data-driven feedback
controller such that the closed-loop system is incrementally passive with
respect to the regulation error and a virtual input. By carefully designing the
virtual input, we solve the data-driven nonlinear output regulation problem
where the reference and disturbances are generated by a linear exosystem. The
designed regulator is composed of an internal model and a passivation feedback
controller characterized by a set of data-dependent linear matrix inequalities.
The proposed data-driven method is also applied to stabilizing the non-zero
equilibrium of a class of nonlinear systems with unknown equilibrium input.
Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed designs.

Conclusion: 该框架为数据驱动控制提供了统计保证的稳定性和安全性，适用于模型未知的场景。

Abstract: We present a true-dynamics-agnostic, statistically rigorous framework for
establishing exponential stability and safety guarantees of closed-loop,
data-driven nonlinear control. Central to our approach is the novel concept of
conformal robustness, which robustifies the Lyapunov and zeroing barrier
certificates of data-driven dynamical systems against model prediction
uncertainties using conformal prediction. It quantifies these uncertainties by
leveraging rank statistics of prediction scores over system trajectories,
without assuming any specific underlying structure of the prediction model or
distribution of the uncertainties. With the quantified uncertainty information,
we further construct the conformally robust control Lyapunov function (CR-CLF)
and control barrier function (CR-CBF), data-driven counterparts of the CLF and
CBF, for fully data-driven control with statistical guarantees of
finite-horizon exponential stability and safety. The performance of the
proposed concept is validated in numerical simulations with four benchmark
nonlinear control problems.
