While the simplicity and\nversatility of parallel grippers have led to widespread adoption, these\ngrippers are limited by their heavy reliance on visual feedback. Tactile\nsensing and soft robotics can add responsiveness and compliance. However,\nexisting methods typically involve high integration complexity or suffer from\nslow response times. In this work, we introduce FORTE, a tactile sensing system\nembedded in compliant gripper fingers. FORTE uses 3D-printed fin-ray grippers\nwith internal air channels to provide low-latency force and slip feedback.\nFORTE applies just enough force to grasp objects without damaging them, while\nremaining easy to fabricate and integrate. We find that FORTE can accurately\nestimate grasping forces from 0-8 N with an average error of 0.2 N, and detect\nslip events within 100 ms of occurring. We demonstrate FORTE's ability to grasp\na wide range of slippery, fragile, and deformable objects. In particular, FORTE\ngrasps fragile objects like raspberries and potato chips with a 98.6% success\nrate, and achieves 93% accuracy in detecting slip events.

We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon\naverage-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and\nreward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller\ndetermines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a\nprivate reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which\nrepresents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition\nkernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate\nthe problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the\nenvironment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper\nconsiders a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market\ncontinues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,\ntruthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential\nauctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves\nthese desired properties.

Their explicit\nnature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting\naccurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments -\nremains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth\nestimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and\nlimit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted\nOpacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D\nGaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work\nby introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian\ndepth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we\nincorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and\nintroduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In\naddition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to\nour opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude.\nAs demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher\nreconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a\nfactor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient\nGaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction."}

Shah"], "title": "A Principled Approach to Randomized Selection under Uncertainty", "comment": null, "summary": "Many decision-making processes involve evaluating and then selecting items;\nexamples include scientific peer review, job hiring, school admissions, and\ninvestment decisions. The eventual selection is performed by applying rules or\ndeliberations to the raw evaluations, and then deterministically selecting the\nitems deemed to be the best. These domains feature error-prone evaluations and\nuncertainty about future outcomes, which undermine the reliability of such\ndeterministic selection rules. As a result, selection mechanisms involving\nexplicit randomization that incorporate the uncertainty are gaining traction in\npractice. However, current randomization approaches are ad hoc, and as we\nprove, inappropriate for their purported objectives. In this paper, we propose\na principled framework for randomized decision-making based on interval\nestimates of the quality of each item. We introduce MERIT (Maximin Efficient\nRandomized Interval Top-k), an optimization-based method that maximizes the\nworst-case expected number of top candidates selected, under uncertainty\nrepresented by overlapping intervals (e.g., confidence intervals or min-max\nintervals). MERIT provides an optimal resource allocation scheme under an\ninterpretable notion of robustness. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to\nsolve the optimization problem and demonstrate empirically that the method\nscales to over 10,000 items. We prove that MERIT satisfies desirable axiomatic\nproperties not guaranteed by existing approaches. Finally, we empirically\ncompare algorithms on synthetic peer review data. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat MERIT matches the performance of existing algorithms in expected utility\nunder fully probabilistic review data models used in previous work, while\noutperforming previous methods with respect to our novel worst-case\nformulation."}

In affective computing, the role of haptic feedback within dynamic\nemotional exchanges remains underexplored. This study investigates how\nsituational emotional cues influence the perception and interpretation of\nhaptic signals given by a robot. In a controlled experiment, 32 participants\nwatched video scenarios in which a robot experienced either positive actions\n(such as being kissed), negative actions (such as being slapped) or neutral\nactions. After each video, the robot conveyed its emotional response through\nhaptic communication, delivered via a wearable vibration sleeve worn by the\nparticipant. Participants rated the robot's emotional state-its valence\n(positive or negative) and arousal (intensity)-based on the video, the haptic\nfeedback, and the combination of the two. The study reveals a dynamic interplay\nbetween visual context and touch. Participants' interpretation of haptic\nfeedback was strongly shaped by the emotional context of the video, with visual\ncontext often overriding the perceived valence of the haptic signal. Negative\nhaptic cues amplified the perceived valence of the interaction, while positive\ncues softened it. Furthermore, haptics override the participants' perception of\narousal of the video. Together, these results offer insights into how situated\nhaptic feedback can enrich affective human-robot interaction, pointing toward\nmore nuanced and embodied approaches to emotional communication with machines."}

We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon\naverage-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and\nreward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller\ndetermines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a\nprivate reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which\nrepresents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition\nkernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate\nthe problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the\nenvironment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper\nconsiders a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market\ncontinues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,\ntruthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential\nauctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves\nthese desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an\nonline reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying\nMDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG\nmechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges\nto a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,\nand individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves\nguaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret."}

Clinicians visually\nevaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score\nbased on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective\nevaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer\ninsights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This\npaper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD\nmotor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant\nfeatures are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence\neffect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and\nclinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.\nPrincipal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based\nfeatures corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis\nhas allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect\nand hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to\ntrain machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society\nUnified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.\nCompared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy\nin MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable\nquantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,\nthe proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective\nassessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both\nclinical and remote settings.

Although segment-wise approaches have obtained\npromising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational\ninefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated\nshapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach.

This study evaluates\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting\nhydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We\nintroduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent\nrepresentations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables.

The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time\nand 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various\nhydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation\nmodel, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on\nthe physical correlation between the new variables and those used during\npretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical\nrelationships.

First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a\ntransformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly\nimplements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard\ningredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,\nwe numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the\nexact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing\na fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or\nmultilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants\nof clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed\n$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer\nmechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and\ninterpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers."}

We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon\naverage-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and\nreward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller\ndetermines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a\nprivate reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which\nrepresents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition\nkernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate\nthe problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the\nenvironment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper\nconsiders a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market\ncontinues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,\ntruthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential\nauctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves\nthese desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an\nonline reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying\nMDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG\nmechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges\nto a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,\nand individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves\nguaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret."}

The key\ncontributions of this work include: derivation of the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound\n(CRLB) and geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) for near-field scenarios;\ndevelopment of two localization algorithms -- one based on Euclidean distance\nmatrix (EDM) and another employing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE);\ncomprehensive performance comparison and computational complexity analysis\nagainst state-of-the-art methods; simulation studies and field experiments; a\nnovel sensor deployment strategy inspired by animal behavior, enabling\nsingle-sensor implementation within the proposed framework for UxV\napplications. The theoretical, simulation, and experimental results demonstrate\nstrong generalizability to other 3D near-field localization tasks, with\nsignificant potential for a cost-effective cross-platform UxV collaborative\nsystem."}

This\nformulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from\nlarge-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,\nUniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to\ndownstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach\nsets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation\nbenchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly\nsurpassing previous methods.

However, existing approaches face\ncritical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and\nsuffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified\nfor computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce\nFastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for\nlarge-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small\nordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered\ngraph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and\naggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual\ndistinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual\nand real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables\nFastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale\nsparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,\na distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between\nsubgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically\nreducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our\nmodels across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein\ndynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark\n(113,000 nodes).

Previous research suffers from the\nproblems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack\nof tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.\nUnlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are\nrepresented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue\ngeometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D\ndisplacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6\nparameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local\ndeformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where\nall motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.\nInter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,\nmaking it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map\nis introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online\napproach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo\nand ex vivo laparoscopic datasets.

Geneticists use this data to\nbuild models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic\nfeatures of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby\nDNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might\nexpect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is\nbottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because\nvariants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion\nof large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting\nsmall models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full\nlikelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast\nlinear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association\nStudies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models\nto optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve\nperformance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting\ntraditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small\nones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,\npotentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target\nidentification."}

In this work, we\nintroduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks\n(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from\nthe parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the\ninferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The\nlearned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base\nnetwork, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a\ntarget network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution\nconditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of\nmodels rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across\nparameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the\ndynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The\nperformance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical\nsystems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and\nextrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were\nunseen during training.

In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a\ncase-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal\nultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2\nmethod for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal\nultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,\nsegmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models\npretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our\nresults demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth\nit, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural\nimage pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance.

We\ndemonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel\nspatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),\nDeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis\ndata), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2\nimages), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,\nand 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,\nand 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,\nDeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the\nmachine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at\nsignificantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without\ncompromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is\nobserved when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their\nrespective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance\nprediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an\nefficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation\ndatasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to\nthe Earth science community.

We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon\naverage-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and\nreward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller\ndetermines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a\nprivate reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which\nrepresents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition\nkernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate\nthe problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the\nenvironment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper\nconsiders a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market\ncontinues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,\ntruthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential\nauctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves\nthese desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an\nonline reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying\nMDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG\nmechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges\nto a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,\nand individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves\nguaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret."}
