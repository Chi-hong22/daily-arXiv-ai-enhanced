### [1] [View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831)
*Josh Qixuan Sun,Xiaoying Xing,Huaiyuan Weng,Chul Min Yeum,Mark Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VIL的视角不变学习策略，用于增强视觉语言导航（VLNCE）中导航策略对相机视角变化的鲁棒性。通过对比学习和师生框架，VIL在V2-VLNCE任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有导航策略对相机视角变化的敏感性问题，提升在连续环境中的视觉语言导航鲁棒性。

Method: 提出VIL策略，结合对比学习框架和师生框架（Waypoint Predictor Module），通过端到端训练优化视角不变特征。

Result: 在V2-VLNCE任务中，VIL在R2R-CE和RxR-CE数据集上的成功率提升了8-15%，且在标准VLNCE设置下仍能提升性能。

Conclusion: VIL是一种即插即用的后训练方法，能够在不影响标准视角性能的情况下，显著提升导航策略的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

### [2] [Detecting Deepfake Talking Heads from Facial Biometric Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08917)
*Justin D. Norman,Hany Farid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于面部生物特征异常模式的深度学习检测方法，用于识别深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术容易被用于欺诈、诈骗和政治虚假信息，亟需有效的检测手段。

Method: 利用面部生物特征中的异常模式，开发了一种新的法医机器学习技术。

Result: 在大规模深度伪造数据集上评估了该技术的有效性，并测试了其对视频篡改的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测深度伪造视频，并对未知生成器具有一定的泛化能力。

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

### [3] [PRISM: Reducing Spurious Implicit Biases in Vision-Language Models with LLM-Guided Embedding Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08979)
*Mahdiyar Molahasani,Azadeh Motamedi,Michael Greenspan,Il-Min Kim,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一种无需额外数据且任务无关的方法，用于减少视觉语言模型中的隐式偏差，通过两阶段方法生成场景描述并学习投影以减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（如CLIP）常因训练数据中的偏差而产生偏斜预测，PRISM旨在无需预定义偏差类别或外部数据的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM分两阶段：1）用LLM生成包含虚假相关性的场景描述；2）通过对比式去偏差损失学习投影，将嵌入映射到减少偏差的潜在空间。

Result: PRISM在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上优于现有去偏差方法。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种有效的数据无关方法，用于减少视觉语言模型中的隐式偏差。

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

### [4] [Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08981)
*Hanbyel Cho,Jaesung Ahn,Yooshin Cho,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时空和运动学信息的HMR-ViT方法，通过构建时空-运动学特征图像并使用Vision Transformer，显著提升了人体网格恢复的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法仅利用时空或运动学信息，缺乏同时利用两者的方法，限制了性能提升。

Method: 构建时空-运动学特征图像，使用通道重排矩阵（CRM）优化特征排列，结合Vision Transformer和回归网络推断SMPL参数。

Result: 在3DPW和Human3.6M数据集上表现优异，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HMR-ViT通过同时利用时空和运动学信息，显著提升了人体网格恢复的精度，具有竞争力。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

### [5] [From images to properties: a NeRF-driven framework for granular material parameter inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09005)
*Cheng-Hsi Hsiao,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合NeRF和MPM的新框架，通过视觉观察推断颗粒材料特性，摩擦角估计误差在2度以内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在直接测量不可行的情况下，通过视觉观察逆向分析颗粒材料特性。

Method: 生成合成实验数据，用NeRF重建3D几何，MPM模拟材料点位置，通过贝叶斯优化最小化图像损失估计摩擦角。

Result: 摩擦角估计误差在2度以内，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为颗粒材料特性表征提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

### [6] [VISTA: A Visual Analytics Framework to Enhance Foundation Model-Generated Data Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09008)
*Xiwei Xuan,Xiaoqi Wang,Wenbin He,Jorge Piazentin Ono,Liang Gou,Kwan-Liu Ma,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一个视觉分析框架，旨在提升多模态基础模型生成的标签质量，通过结合多阶段数据验证策略和人类专业知识，解决现有方法在数据质量评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态基础模型（如CLIP和LLaVA）的自动标注能力虽强，但其生成的标签质量缺乏深入研究，现有方法更关注数据量而非质量。

Method: VISTA框架整合了多阶段数据验证策略和人类专业知识，帮助识别和修正标签中的隐藏问题。

Result: 在开放词汇图像分割领域的两个基准数据集上，VISTA通过定量和定性分析证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: VISTA显著提升了多模态模型的数据质量，为复杂任务（如开放词汇图像分割）提供了更可靠的标签。

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

### [8] [Can Contrastive Learning Improve Class-Imbalanced Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09052)
*Fang Chen,Alex Villa,Gongbo Liang,Xiaoyi Lu,Meng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种对比损失函数，用于解决类别不平衡扩散模型中尾部类别图像多样性不足的问题，同时保持头部类别的保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡数据导致尾部类别图像合成时出现模式崩溃和多样性降低，作者旨在提升尾部类别多样性而不影响头部类别。

Method: 引入无监督InfoNCE损失和MSE损失，通过对比学习增加尾部类别图像的多样性，并利用条件-无条件对齐共享头部类别知识。

Result: 方法在多个数据集（如CIFAR10/100-LT等）上优于标准DDPM和其他替代方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架简单有效，成功提升了类别不平衡扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

TL;DR: 论文提出无限视频理解（Infinite Video Understanding）作为多媒体研究的新前沿，旨在解决模型处理超长视频时的计算、内存和连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解模型在处理超长视频时面临计算、内存和连贯性挑战，需要突破性解决方案。

Method: 提出将无限视频理解作为研究目标，推动流式架构、持久内存机制、分层表示等领域创新。

Result: 未提供具体实验结果，但提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 无限视频理解是多媒体和AI研究的重要方向，需在架构、表示和评估方法上持续创新。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

### [10] [BlindSight: Harnessing Sparsity for Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09071)
*Tharun Adithya Srikrishnan,Deval Shah,Steven K. Reinhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlindSight通过利用注意力稀疏性优化视觉语言模型推理，减少计算量，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉数据的加入显著增加了提示长度和注意力计算的复杂度，导致推理时间延长。

Method: 分析注意力模式，提出基于输入模板的稀疏注意力掩码BlindSight，无需训练即可优化推理。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL等模型上，FLOPs减少32%-41%，准确性变化在-2%到+2%之间。

Conclusion: BlindSight是一种高效且无需训练的优化方法，适用于多图像理解任务。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: 展望了下一代基础模型的发展方向，强调统一建模能力、跨域泛化性和物理可解释性。

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需微调的零样本方法，通过扰动生成视频模型提取光流，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过冻结的自监督视频模型（仅用于未来帧预测）直接提取光流，避免因标签稀缺和合成数据与真实数据差距带来的微调需求。

Method: 基于CWM范式，提出KL-tracing方法：通过局部扰动第一帧，计算预测分布间的KL散度，提取光流。模型需满足分布预测、因子化潜在空间和随机访问解码等特性。

Result: 在TAP-Vid DAVIS和Kubric数据集上，性能分别提升16.6%和4.7%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可控生成视频模型的因果提示是高质量光流提取的可扩展且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器视觉在医疗和自动化电厂等关键领域的应用，理解卷积神经网络的内部机制及其推理原因变得至关重要。

Method: MI CAM通过互信息加权特征图，并与激活图线性组合生成显著性可视化，同时通过反事实分析验证因果解释。

Result: MI CAM在定性和定量指标上优于部分现有方法，与最先进方法表现相当。

Conclusion: MI CAM提供了无偏见的模型推理解释，其实现已公开。

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method
can be found on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MI-CAM-4D27

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了眼动的顺序信息，而RadEyeVideo旨在利用时空动态的眼动数据提升模型性能。

Method: 提出RadEyeVideo方法，将眼动数据作为视频序列输入，结合开放域LVLMs进行评估。

Result: 模型性能在报告生成任务中提升24.6%，平均提升15.2%，甚至超越专业医学模型。

Conclusion: RadEyeVideo展示了专家知识（眼动信息）与通用模型的结合可显著提升临床任务表现，推动人机交互的医疗应用。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

Conclusion: Stable Diffusion模型可显著增强3D点云表示学习，代码已开源。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

### [16] [Hybrid Autoregressive-Diffusion Model for Real-Time Streaming Sign Language Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09105)
*Maoxiao Ye,Xinfeng Ye,Mano Manoharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法，用于手语生成（SLP），解决了传统方法的错误累积和实时性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归方法在推理阶段无法避免错误累积，而扩散模型因迭代性质不适用于实时任务。

Method: 采用混合模型，结合自回归和扩散模型的优势；设计了多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上验证了生成质量和实时流效率。

Conclusion: 混合方法显著提升了手语生成的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

Conclusion: RoHOI基准和SAMPL策略为提升HOI检测在复杂环境中的鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了CLIP模型中模态间隙的作用，而该间隙对其泛化和适应能力至关重要。本文旨在通过分析模态间隙的变化，提出一种改进持续学习性能的方法。

Method: 提出MG-CLIP方法，通过保持模态间隙以减少遗忘，并通过补偿模态间隙增强对新数据的适应能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MG-CLIP表现优于现有方法，且无需额外数据。

Conclusion: 模态间隙是持续学习中的关键因素，MG-CLIP方法通过利用这一间隙显著提升了CLIP模型的持续学习性能。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SnapMoGen和MoMask++为文本生成动作提供了更高质量的数据集和模型，支持长期动作生成研究。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

TL;DR: PoseLLM提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的姿态估计框架，通过非线性MLP视觉语言连接器提升定位精度，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计方法依赖关键点先验，泛化能力有限；现有语言引导方法（如LocLLM）的线性投影器无法捕捉复杂空间-文本交互。

Method: PoseLLM用非线性MLP替换线性投影器，实现跨模态特征分层融合。

Result: 在COCO验证集上达到77.8 AP，优于LocLLM（+0.4 AP），并在Human-Art和MPII上保持强零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 非线性连接器显著提升定位精度且不牺牲泛化能力，推动了语言引导姿态估计的先进水平。

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$I^{2}$-World的高效框架，用于4D占用预测，通过解耦场景标记化并采用编码器-解码器架构，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中复杂3D场景的高效标记化问题，以应对极端情况。

Method: 提出双标记器设计（场景内和场景间），结合多尺度残差量化和残差聚合，采用编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在4D占用预测中，mIoU和IoU分别提升25.1%和36.9%，计算效率高（2.9 GB内存，37.0 FPS）。

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为3D场景预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Stable Score Distillation (SSD)的新方法，通过简化框架提升文本引导图像和3D编辑的稳定性和对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Delta Denoising Score在稳定性、空间控制和编辑强度方面存在不足，主要依赖于复杂的辅助结构，导致优化信号冲突和局部编辑受限。

Method: SSD通过固定一个分类器到源提示，利用Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)方程实现跨提示对齐，并引入常数项null-text分支稳定优化过程。

Result: SSD在2D和3D编辑任务（如NeRF和文本驱动风格编辑）中取得最先进结果，收敛更快且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: SSD为文本引导编辑提供了一种稳健高效的解决方案，保持了原始内容结构并确保编辑轨迹与源提示紧密对齐。

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to
deploy domain randomization over training processes.

Result: 实验表明，LGSP-Prompt在多个FSCIL基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt通过空间维度的提示学习，有效解决了FSCIL中的性能退化问题，为增量学习提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA通过缓解图像对齐偏差，显著改善了多模态对齐效果。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

Result: 在ASPIRe和AeroEye-v1.0数据集上的实验表明，THYME优于现有方法，提升了场景理解的准确性。

Conclusion: THYME方法有效解决了动态场景图生成的挑战，为复杂场景提供了更准确的表示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for

Conclusion: S3AD算法和KITTI-AR数据集为3D异常检测提供了有效的解决方案，增强了模型对罕见目标的检测能力。

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏大规模全景图像数据集，现有二维预训练模型无法处理全景图像的失真和不连续性，影响任务表现。

Method: 采用基于预训练模型权重的球形离散采样方法，减少失真并获得良好初始训练值；应用于全景图像分割，利用球形模型特征作为通道注意力掩码。

Result: 在Stanford2D3D室内数据集上取得了显著效果。

Conclusion: 球形采样方法有效解决了全景图像任务中的失真问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

*Görkay Aydemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线长期点跟踪方法Track-On，基于Transformer架构，无需未来帧信息，在七个公开基准上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景需要在线预测（仅用当前和过去帧），而现有方法多为离线（依赖未来帧）。视觉基础模型虽能提供几何表示，但缺乏时序推理。

Method: 评估视觉基础模型的适用性，提出Track-On模型，将跟踪点作为查询，逐帧处理视频，利用记忆模块保持时序一致性。

Result: Track-On在七个公开基准上达到最优性能，证明了无需未来信息的长期跟踪可行性。

Conclusion: Track-On为在线长期点跟踪提供了有效解决方案，结合视觉基础模型和Transformer架构，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型（如CLIP和SAM）在低样本迁移学习中表现出色，但面临训练与测试数据分布偏移及置信度不匹配问题，现有解决方案多为领域特定。

Method: 提出StaRFM框架，结合FIP（针对分布偏移）和CMP（针对置信度校准），并扩展至3D医学数据。

Result: 在19个视觉数据集上提升3.5%准确率，降低28% ECE；医学分割任务中达到84.7% DSC和4.8mm HD95，跨域性能差距降低40%。

Conclusion: StaRFM是一个即插即用的通用框架，无需大幅修改模型结构，显著提升基础模型的性能与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于生成先验的方法，从第一人称视角重建可动画化的虚拟形象，利用Stable Diffusion减少训练负担并提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决从第一人称视角重建人体外观时的遮挡和比例失真问题，并减少对多视角数据集的依赖。

Method: 采用ControlNet和Stable Diffusion框架，从遮挡的俯视图像生成真实的正视图像，再通过图像到运动模型生成虚拟形象动作。

Result: 成功从单张俯视图像生成真实的正视表示，并进一步生成虚拟形象动作。

Conclusion: 该方法为更易用和泛化的数字远程呈现系统提供了可能。

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

Conclusion: AGCD-Net通过创新的架构和因果干预方法，显著提升了情感识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理高阶关联和语义模糊样本时存在不足，尤其是软正样本和软负样本的区分问题，以及未能充分利用训练批次中样本间的邻域关系。

Method: AAHR框架结合了动态聚类原型对比学习、全局-局部特征提取、自适应聚合网络、GNN增强语义交互以及动量对比学习扩展负样本集。

Result: 实验表明，AAHR在Flickr30K、MSCOCO和ECCV Caption数据集上优于现有方法，显著提升了匹配准确性和效率。

Conclusion: AAHR通过多策略结合有效解决了图像-文本匹配中的语义模糊和高阶关联问题，为跨模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The
code and model checkpoints for this research are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无注释手语翻译方法虽性能强，但模型复杂且计算需求高，难以扩展。

Method: 利用分段感知视觉标记化将视频转换为离散标记，减少输入序列长度；引入标记间对比对齐目标和双级监督。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T基准测试中性能超越现有方法，序列长度减少50%，内存使用降低2.67倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和可扩展性上优于现有技术，验证了标记化和对齐策略的有效性。

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: MLLMs在医疗等安全关键领域的应用受到提示设计敏感性和高置信度错误响应的限制，需要提升其可信度。

Result: 在PMC-VQA基准测试中达到最先进的医疗视觉问答性能，并展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust展示了自动化提示工程在提升MLLMs可信度方面的潜力，尤其在安全关键领域。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains
underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

Motivation: 路径平滑性在专家演示的路径模仿学习中常被忽视，本文旨在通过自适应路径平滑性提升路径相似性。

Method: 提出DAA*方法，结合PAF探索移动角度对路径节点扩展的影响，通过路径缩短和平滑的联合优化提升路径最优性。

Result: 在7个数据集上的实验显示，DAA*在路径相似性和长度上显著优于现有方法，如SPR提升9.0%。

Conclusion: DAA*通过自适应路径平滑性显著提升了路径模仿学习的性能，同时讨论了路径最优性与搜索效率的权衡。

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

*Zile Wang,Hao Yu,Jiabo Zhan,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALPHA是一个针对RGBA图像的新基准，ALPHAVAE是一个改进的VAE模型，显著提升了透明图像生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在透明或分层内容（RGBA图像）生成方面研究不足，缺乏大规模基准。

Method: 提出ALPHA基准和ALPHAVAE模型，结合多种目标优化RGBA图像生成。

Result: ALPHAVAE在少量数据上训练，性能优于现有方法，PSNR提升4.9 dB，SSIM提升3.2%。

Conclusion: ALPHAVAE在透明图像生成中表现优异，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态对话系统研究的深入，用户期望系统能更主动地交互，例如在视频播放时自主决定多轮回应的时机。

Method: 引入ProactiveBench基准和PAUC指标，考虑模型响应的时间动态性，并通过用户研究验证。

Result: PAUC与传统指标相比更符合人类偏好，能更准确地评估主动交互场景的用户体验。

Conclusion: PAUC为主动交互场景提供了更可靠的评估方法，推动了多模态对话系统的发展。

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

Motivation: 现有音频-视频预训练方法仅关注整体模态对齐，忽略了通过认知对比强化易混淆类别的区分能力。

Method: 提出DICCAE编码器，动态调整类间混淆损失，并引入融合音频和视频模态的训练框架。为解决数据稀缺问题，采用聚类引导的自监督预训练策略。

Result: 在VGGSound数据集上达到65.5%的top-1准确率，接近SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DICCAE通过细粒度对齐和动态混淆损失有效提升模型性能，各模块的必要性通过消融实验验证。

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

Motivation: 3D MLLMs在场景理解方面表现出色，但计算效率低下限制了其实际部署，主要原因是处理过多的对象中心视觉令牌。

Method: 提出Fast3D框架，包含全局注意力预测（GAP）和样本自适应剪枝（SAP）两项技术，无需修改目标模型参数。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了Fast3D的有效性，尤其在高剪枝率下表现优异。

Conclusion: Fast3D为3D MLLMs提供了一种高效的视觉令牌剪枝解决方案，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究是否可以通过简单的架构（如Video ViTs）结合预训练实现高效的交通异常检测，避免复杂设计的冗余。

Method: 采用简单的编码器架构（Video ViTs），研究不同预训练方法（弱监督、全监督、自监督MVM及领域自适应预训练DAPT）对性能的影响。

Result: 简单架构结合强预训练（尤其是自监督MVM和DAPT）可匹配或超越现有复杂方法，且更高效。

Conclusion: 预训练是关键，简单架构结合适当预训练可实现高效、可扩展的交通异常检测。

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a
global scale.

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study
animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a
non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has
increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and
manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging.
These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for

workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational
resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process
camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for
small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By
focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for
data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover
meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

Conclusion: LifelongPR框架有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题，提升了点云地点识别的持续学习能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

Result: 实验表明CKAA优于现有的PEFT持续学习方法。

Conclusion: CKAA通过知识对齐和自适应聚合任务特定知识，显著提升了模型对误导任务ID的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

Conclusion: HMID-Net在双曲空间中成功应用MIM和知识蒸馏，为高效模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

### [59] [GLIMPSE: Do Large Vision-Language Models Truly Think With Videos or Just Glimpse at Them?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09491)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个新的视频基准测试，旨在评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否能真正理解视频内容，而不仅仅是静态图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试多基于静态图像分析，无法评估LVLMs是否具备深度时间推理能力。

Method: GLIMPSE包含3,269个视频和4,342个视觉中心问题，涵盖11个类别，要求模型观看完整视频并进行推理。

Result: 人类评估准确率达94.82%，而最佳LVLM（GPT-o3）仅达66.43%，表明模型在深度视频理解上仍有困难。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE揭示了LVLMs在真正理解视频内容方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move
beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合张量分解和正则化的自适应性网络（SDTN）及轻量级网络（TRN），用于高光谱图像分类，解决了高维数据、光谱-空间冗余和标记样本稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类在精准农业中至关重要，但传统方法因高维数据、冗余和标记样本稀缺导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出SDTN动态调整张量秩以优化特征表示，并基于SDTN设计TRN轻量级网络，捕获多尺度光谱-空间特征。

Result: 在PaviaU数据集上实验显示，相比现有方法，准确率显著提升且模型参数减少。

Conclusion: SDTN和TRN框架在保持高分类精度的同时降低了计算复杂度，适合资源受限环境中的实时部署。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可靠的测试时适应方法（ReTA），通过一致性感知熵重加权（CER）和多样性驱动的分布校准（DDC）解决现有缓存方法在分布偏移下的不可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在无标注数据的下游任务中面临分布偏移问题，现有缓存方法因熵不可靠和决策边界不灵活导致性能下降。

Method: ReTA结合CER（利用一致性约束加权熵）和DDC（将类文本嵌入建模为高斯分布以校准决策边界），提升缓存质量和预测准确性。

Result: 实验表明，ReTA在真实分布偏移场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTA通过双重策略显著提升了测试时适应的可靠性，适用于复杂分布偏移任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Conclusion: 所提方法在微手势在线识别任务中表现出色，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuarterMap是一种后训练激活剪枝方法，通过去除冗余空间激活并恢复维度，提升VMamba等SSM模型的吞吐量，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VMamba等SSM模型中空间冗余问题，提高效率而不需重新训练。

Method: 提出QuarterMap方法，通过剪枝冗余激活和最近邻上采样恢复维度，优化扫描过程。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现11%速度提升，精度下降小于0.9%；在ADE20K和MedMamba上同样有效。

Conclusion: QuarterMap是一种即插即用的高效部署工具，适用于SSM模型，且不影响迁移性。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DehazeSB提出了一种基于Schr\"odinger Bridge的无配对去雾框架，利用最优传输理论直接连接雾图和清晰图的分布，并通过细节保留正则化和提示学习提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的无配对去雾方法因生成器的传输映射能力有限，效果受限。

Method: 采用Schr\"odinger Bridge框架和最优传输理论，结合细节保留正则化和基于CLIP的提示学习。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DehazeSB通过优化传输映射和细节保留，显著提升了无配对去雾的效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

TL;DR: VDInstruct是一种多模态大语言模型，通过内容感知的标记化策略和显式布局建模，显著提升了密集文档的理解能力，减少了计算冗余，并在KIE基准测试中取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在密集文档上表现不佳，且依赖与图像大小成比例的视觉标记化方法，导致计算冗余和内存效率低下。

Method: 提出VDInstruct模型，将空间区域检测与语义特征提取分离，采用内容感知的标记化策略，根据文档复杂度生成标记，并通过三阶段训练范式优化模型。

Result: 在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA结果，图像标记数量减少约3.6倍，零样本评估中F1分数超过基线模型5.5分。

Conclusion: 内容感知标记化与显式布局建模为文档理解提供了有前景的方向，模型和数据将公开。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

Result: 在多个公开红外数据集上，DRPCA-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net通过结合稀疏先验和动态参数生成，实现了高效且鲁棒的红外小目标检测。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

Result: DeRefNet在SeqCSIST数据集上优于现有方法，mAP提升5.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次在多帧范式中解决CSIST解混任务，开源数据集和工具包推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available

Motivation: 现有方法忽视指尖和手腕关节的重要性，导致远端关节误差累积，影响整体姿态估计质量。

Method: EHPE分为两个阶段：TW-stage提取指尖和手腕关节；PG-stage通过双分支交互网络细化其余关节位置。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中，EHPE实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EHPE通过分段架构有效解决了误差累积问题，提升了手部姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available

Result: 系统能够生成高质量、多语言支持的艺术字体，显著提升交互性和创意性。

Conclusion: WordCraft为艺术家和设计师提供了更灵活、高效的创作工具。

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

Conclusion: MENTOR通过高效的多模态条件调优，显著提升了多模态图像生成的性能和控制性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction
fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to
diffusion-based methods. Dataset, code, and models are available at:

Conclusion: MA-SAM2在无需额外参数或训练的情况下，展示了在手术应用中的实用潜力。

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical
surgical applications.

TL;DR: Inter2Former通过优化密集令牌处理的计算分配，提出四种关键改进，实现了在CPU设备上高效且高精度的交互式分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前交互式分割方法在密集令牌处理速度慢与稀疏令牌分割质量低之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出Dynamic Prompt Embedding (DPE)、Dynamic Hybrid Attention (DHA)、Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE)和Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU)四种改进方法。

Result: 在高精度交互式分割基准测试中，Inter2Former实现了SOTA性能，并在CPU设备上高效运行。

Conclusion: Inter2Former通过自适应计算策略，显著提升了交互式分割的效率和精度。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

TL;DR: FAIR方法通过动态对齐图像和文本特征，改进了无监督适应中的伪标签生成，显著提升了细粒度分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督适应方法在细粒度分类中表现不佳，要么依赖固定对齐分数，要么计算成本高。

Method: 提出FAIR方法，利用Class Description Anchors动态对齐特征，并引入Learned Alignment Score和自训练权重机制。

Result: 在13个细粒度数据集上，FAIR比现有方法性能提升2.78%。

Conclusion: FAIR通过动态跨模态交互和伪标签优化，显著提升了无监督适应性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中异常检测样本稀缺，现有方法在定位和分类任务中效果有限，且异常合成方法存在低真实性、掩码对齐不准确和泛化性差的问题。

Method: GAA通过局部概念分解联合建模异常语义特征和空间信息，利用自适应多轮异常聚类增强异常表示一致性，结合区域引导掩码生成和低质量样本过滤模块。

Result: 在MVTec AD和LOCO数据集上的实验表明，GAA在异常合成质量和下游任务（如定位和分类）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GAA框架通过区域引导和少样本生成，显著提升了异常合成的真实性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Result: 所有模型在DR预测中表现优异（AUROC高达94%），但公平性评估显示存在差异（如DINOv2中年龄组间AUROC差距达10%）。解缠技术对模型性能影响不一。

Conclusion: 研究强调了医学影像AI中公平性的重要性，解缠技术在减少偏差方面效果因模型而异，需进一步优化以实现公平可靠的医疗解决方案。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

Conclusion: EyeSeg通过不确定性建模显著提升了眼部分割和视线估计的鲁棒性和准确性，适用于AR/VR交互。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual
alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This
paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and
continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately

To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is

patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D
pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and

outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such

commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

Result: token压缩在标准ViT上有效，但在紧凑ViT上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在边缘AI中优化紧凑Transformer提供了方向。

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

Conclusion: $L^2$-VSD是一种高效且稳定的改进方法，显著提升了文本到3D生成的效果。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

Result: 在RePAIR 2D数据集上实现了最先进的邻域级精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了碎片兼容性计算的性能，适用于考古拼图等实际应用。

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

Motivation: 现有负标签方法（如NegLabel和CSP）在零样本OOD检测中表现良好，但存在将分布内样本误判为OOD的问题，且难以处理多标签匹配的图像。

Method: NegRefine通过过滤子类别标签和专有名词优化负标签集，并引入动态调整多标签匹配贡献的评分函数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等大规模基准测试中，NegRefine表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NegRefine显著提升了零样本OOD检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

TL;DR: VRU-Accident是一个大规模视觉语言基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在涉及弱势道路使用者的高风险交通场景中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中弱势道路用户（VRUs）安全问题，缺乏标准化基准评估多模态大语言模型在复杂安全关键场景中的推理能力。

Method: 提出VRU-Accident基准，包含1K真实事故视频、6K多选问答对和1K密集场景描述，评估17种先进模型。

Result: 多模态大语言模型在视觉基础属性表现良好，但在事故原因、类型和可预防性推理方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: VRU-Accident填补了评估多模态大语言模型在VRU-vehicle事故场景中的空白，揭示了模型在复杂推理任务中的不足。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

### [88] [Hierarchical Abstraction Enables Human-Like 3D Object Recognition in Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09830)
*Shuhao Fu,Philip J. Kellman,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了人类和深度学习模型在识别3D形状时的表现差异，发现视觉变换器模型更接近人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习模型是否形成与人类相似的3D形状表征，以理解其识别机制。

Method: 通过两个人类实验和两种深度学习模型（DGCNN和点变换器）对比，分析点密度、对象方向和局部几何结构的影响。

Result: 点变换器模型在3D形状的层次抽象机制上优于卷积模型，更接近人类表现。

Conclusion: 点变换器模型在3D形状表征上更接近人类视觉机制，为模型优化提供方向。

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1)
methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2)
training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response
tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets

Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and
propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and
robustness of VRDU systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of large-scale models has catalyzed significant
breakthroughs in the digital human domain. These advanced methodologies offer
high-fidelity solutions for avatar driving and rendering, leading academia to
focus on the next major challenge: audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual
human. To facilitate research in this emerging area, we present SpeakerVid-5M
dataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual
dyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours,
SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It
covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,
listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along
two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized
into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and
multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based
video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of
metrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work.
Both the dataset and the corresponding data processing code will be publicly
released. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/SpeakerVid-5M/

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视频推理范式ViTCoT，结合视觉和文本信息，显著提升了视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频推理方法主要依赖文本信息，忽略了视觉模态，而人类推理时会自然结合视觉内容。

Method: 构建了Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB)，并探索了ViTCoT范式在视频理解中的应用。

Result: ViTCoT显著优于传统纯文本CoT范式，并激活了更多MLLM神经元。

Conclusion: ViTCoT为视频推理提供了更直观且认知对齐的方法。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实视觉解释方法忽视因果关系和虚假相关性，导致解释质量受限。

Method: 采用因果引导的对抗方法生成反事实解释，避免对虚假因素的干扰。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，实现了有效性、稀疏性、接近性和真实性的平衡。

Conclusion: CECAS框架通过因果视角显著提升了反事实解释的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段方法MCGA，通过学习光谱模式和细化RGB-to-HSI映射，结合先验知识，实现了高效的HSI重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接学习RGB-to-HSI映射，忽略了从低维到高维信息的转换挑战，MCGA通过分阶段学习解决了这一问题。

Method: 第一阶段使用多尺度VQ-VAE学习光谱模式，提取混合码本（MoC）；第二阶段通过查询MoC特征细化映射，并引入灰度感知注意力和量化自注意力。

Result: MCGA在实验中实现了最先进的性能，代码和模型已公开。

Conclusion: MCGA通过分阶段学习和注意力机制，显著提升了HSI重建的质量和效率。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空图像中物体的任意方向性使得旋转等变性成为关键特性，但现有方法多为近似实现，严格旋转等变性的必要性尚不明确。

Method: 实现严格旋转等变的骨干和颈部网络，并设计多分支头网络以减少参数并提升精度。

Result: 在DOTA-v1.0、DOTA-v1.5和DIOR-R数据集上达到最优性能，且参数量极低。

Conclusion: 严格旋转等变性对航空图像检测器性能有显著提升，多分支头设计有效平衡了参数与精度。

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

Motivation: 现有图形设计方法缺乏创造力和可编辑性，导致自动化设计效果不佳。

Result: 实验结果表明，IGD在复杂图形设计任务中表现出色，提供了新的解决方案。

Conclusion: IGD为图形设计提供了一种可扩展且高效的自动化方法。

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

Motivation: 数据稀缺导致模型过拟合和数据集不平衡，现有生成模型生成的样本重复或简单，无法针对下游模型弱点提供关键信息。

Method: 提出Crucial-Diff框架，包含场景无关特征提取器（SAFE）和弱点感知样本挖掘器（WASM），生成多样且高质量的样本。

Result: 在MVTec上达到83.63%的像素级AP和78.12%的F1-MAX；在息肉数据集上达到81.64%的mIoU和87.69%的mDice。

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff有效解决了数据稀缺问题，显著提升了检测和分割性能。

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

Result: Gemini 2.0 Flash的宏F1得分为56.79%，优于GPT-4o-mini的43.28%。

Conclusion: 研究为电商产品属性任务提供了实用见解，并强调了领域特定微调的必要性。

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了4D-STEM的能力，为辐射敏感材料的结构分析提供了一种通用且高效的新方法。

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖KL散度估计不确定性，忽略了模态间的领域差异，导致多视图集成和决策的可靠性不足。

Method: KPHD-Net使用变分Dirichlet分布表示类别概率分布，结合Hölder散度和Dempster-Shafer证据理论，并引入Kalman滤波器进行状态估计。

Conclusion: KPHD-Net通过改进的不确定性估计和多视图融合方法，显著提升了多视图学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 3DGAA是一种基于3D高斯分布的对抗攻击框架，通过联合优化几何和外观属性，提升物理真实性和攻击鲁棒性，显著降低目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D和3D物理攻击方法在平衡物理真实性和攻击鲁棒性方面存在不足，需要一种更有效的对抗攻击框架来评估自动驾驶感知系统的安全性。

Method: 提出3DGAA框架，利用3D高斯分布的14维参数化联合优化几何（形状、尺度、旋转）和外观（颜色、透明度）属性，并引入物理过滤和增强模块以提升真实性和泛化能力。

Result: 在虚拟和物理实验中，3DGAA将检测mAP从87.21%降至7.38%，显著优于现有方法，并展现出高迁移性。

Conclusion: 3DGAA为自动驾驶感知系统的安全性评估提供了一种实用且高效的对抗攻击框架。

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

Motivation: 通过多壳层扩散MRI数据的微观结构信息，结合深度学习技术，提高阿尔茨海默病和淀粉样蛋白积累的早期诊断准确性。

Method: 采用Swin Transformer模型，结合DTI和NODDI关键指标，通过低秩适应技术优化模型，用于阿尔茨海默病和淀粉样蛋白状态的分类。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病痴呆与认知正常个体的分类中达到95.2%的平衡准确率；淀粉样蛋白检测中，对轻度认知障碍/阿尔茨海默病痴呆与认知正常个体的分类准确率为77.2%。

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and
logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become
essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent,
especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and
rescue, and agricultural monitoring, where operations in complex environments
can provide enhanced security. Current mainstream Anti-UAV tracking
technologies are primarily centered around computer vision techniques,
particularly those that integrate multi-sensor data fusion with advanced
detection and tracking algorithms. This paper first reviews the characteristics
and current challenges of Anti-UAV detection and tracking technologies. Next,
it investigates and compiles several publicly available datasets, providing
accessible links to support researchers in efficiently addressing related
challenges. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the major vision-based and
vision-fusion-based Anti-UAV detection and tracking algorithms proposed in
recent years. Finally, based on the above research, this paper outlines future
research directions, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing the
field.

### [105] [Binomial Self-Compensation: Mechanism and Suppression of Motion Error in Phase-Shifting Profilometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10009)
*Geyou Zhang,Kai Liu,Ce Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种图像序列二项式自补偿（I-BSC）方法，通过加权求和同质条纹图像而非相位帧，解决了相位序列二项式自补偿（P-BSC）的高计算开销和误差累积问题，显著提升了动态3D扫描的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相位移相轮廓术（PSP）在动态测量中因物体运动假设不成立而失效，需解决运动误差问题。

Method: 提出I-BSC方法，对同质条纹图像进行加权求和，仅计算一次反正切函数，降低计算复杂度和误差累积。

Result: I-BSC在减少运动误差的同时实现准单帧速率，计算帧速率提升数倍至数十倍，且运动误差收敛更快。

Conclusion: I-BSC显著优于现有方法，适用于高像素-深度-时间分辨率的3D重建。

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文重新评估了视觉与语言模型（VLMs）是否像人类一样整合跨模态信息，发现CLIP的ResNet和ViT变体并未一致表现出bouba-kiki效应，与人类认知存在差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否像人类一样整合跨模态信息，尤其是bouba-kiki效应。

Method: 使用基于提示的概率评估和Grad-CAM视觉注意力分析，测试CLIP的ResNet和ViT变体。

Result: 模型未一致表现出bouba-kiki效应，ResNet偏好圆形但整体表现与人类认知不符。

Conclusion: VLMs在跨模态概念理解上存在局限性，与人类直觉不一致。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hyma的新方法，通过超网络技术优化多模态模型中单模态模型的选择和连接器训练，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练连接器模块以对齐单模态模型时计算成本高，且随着单模态模型数量的增加，问题更加突出。

Method: 利用超网络的参数预测能力，为多组单模态模型联合训练连接器模块。

Result: 实验表明，Hyma将最优单模态模型对的搜索成本降低了10倍，同时性能与网格搜索相当。

Conclusion: Hyma是一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，适用于多模态模型的构建。

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决在边缘设备上有限计算资源下，如何高效个性化文本到图像扩散模型，同时保护用户隐私的问题。

Method: 提出选择性优化框架，动态选择BP-low和ZO-high，并通过时间步感知的概率函数优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在显著降低内存消耗的同时，保持了高性能，实现了可扩展的高质量设备端个性化。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合了BP-low和ZO-high的优势，实现了内存高效且高质量的模型个性化。

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

understanding, as it is a necessary first stage for many downstream tasks like
character analysis, story indexing, or metadata enrichment. We formalize PSS
for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo,
developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Conclusion: MoVieS通过统一建模动态场景，支持零样本应用，并在速度和性能上表现出色。

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D
scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising
their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified
modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis,

By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

Conclusion: 通过频率域调节机制，本文为扩散模型的曝光偏差问题提供了有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了域差异导致的性能下降，为数据稀缺且环境独特的遥感场景提供了高精度信息提取技术范式。

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: FIX-CLIP有效扩展了CLIP的长文本处理能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or
feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and
calibration for spatial validation.

images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

Result: 反馈模型在噪声条件下表现更优，仅需两个训练样本即可超越随机性能，而前馈模型需至少四个。

Conclusion: 反馈机制增强了模型的鲁棒性和数据效率，为更自适应和生物启发的神经网络架构提供了方向。

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

Motivation: 由于隐私问题和手动标注成本高，合成数据常用于预训练模型，但合成数据与真实数据之间的域差距（如光照、颜色和视角差异）限制了模型效果。

Method: 提出了一种统一的文本人物检索流程，包含两个主要组件：图像级别的域感知扩散（DaD）和区域级别的多粒度关系对齐（MRA）。

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES和RSTPReid数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 通过双级别域适应方法，显著提升了文本人物检索的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are

TL;DR: 提出ECP框架，解决多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像中细粒度定位和推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在高分辨率图像中表现不佳，因固定分辨率的训练与测试分辨率不一致导致泛化能力差。

Method: ECP框架分两阶段：先通过低分辨率图像预测候选区域，再基于候选区域进行最终预测。

Result: 在4K GUI grounding和4K、8K MLLM感知任务中，分别提升21.3%、5.8%、5.2%。

Conclusion: ECP有效保留细节并提升性能，无需额外训练。代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习常因优化不足而表现不如单模态学习，现有方法通过梯度平衡解决，但作者认为平衡学习并非最优。

Method: 提出ARL策略，通过辅助正则器计算模态预测方差，并基于方差比重新加权优化，同时引入预测偏差最小化泛化误差。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了ARL的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: ARL无需额外参数，独立于多模态模型结构，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Result: 研究发现种族背景对情绪表达有显著影响，并提出了一个考虑种族差异的框架。

Conclusion: 结论是情绪普遍性假设存在过度泛化，种族背景应在情绪分析中被纳入考量。

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解耦梯度学习（DGL）框架，解决了多模态学习中模态编码器和模态融合模块之间的优化冲突，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习存在优化不足问题，甚至性能低于单模态学习。现有方法未能解释主导模态在多模态模型中表现不佳的原因。

Method: 提出DGL框架，通过截断多模态损失的反向传播梯度，并用单模态损失的梯度替代，同时移除单模态损失对融合模块的梯度干扰。

Result: 实验表明，DGL在多种模态、任务和框架中均有效且通用。

Conclusion: DGL通过解耦优化过程，显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化人体图像生成需要精确保留属性（如身份、服装细节），现有方法计算成本高且不适用于实时应用。

Method: 训练LoRA层，利用空间参考减少信息丢失，并引入选择性主体区域损失以优化生成效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性上显著优于现有技术，支持单模型生成。

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA无需额外参数，高效实现高保真个性化人体图像生成。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，VRFNO显著优于Reflow，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VRFNO有效解决了Reflow的局限性，提升了生成图像的质量和效率。

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

Motivation: 传统密集预测方法通常计算成本高且参数多，SL旨在通过维度提升实现高效、准确的预测。

Method: SL将2D输入（如图像）提升到高维空间（如3D），并使用对应维度的网络（如3D U-Net）处理，生成结构化输出。

Result: 在19个基准数据集（13个语义分割和6个深度估计）上验证，模型参数减少98%以上，推理成本降低，性能仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: SL为密集预测任务提供了更高效、准确和可靠的深度学习新范式。

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，AUROC提升2.80%，FPR95降低11.13%。

Conclusion: SynOOD通过合成边界对齐的OOD数据，显著提升了OOD检测性能，且计算开销小。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID

Motivation: 探索风格迁移是否能在语义分割中减少纹理偏置并提高鲁棒性。

Method: 使用Voronoi细胞生成随机区域进行风格迁移，训练语义分割DNN。

Result: 风格迁移减少了纹理偏置，显著提高了对图像损坏和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 风格迁移在语义分割中具有普适性，适用于不同架构和数据集。

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多折叠径向对称的Kaleidoscopic Background Attack（KBA）方法，用于攻击相机姿态估计模型，并通过优化方法提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏输入的物体中心场景中，背景纹理可能显著影响相机姿态估计的准确性，因此需要一种有效的攻击方法。

Method: 使用相同片段形成多折叠径向对称的圆盘（KBA），并提出投影方向一致性损失优化这些片段。

Result: 优化的对抗性背景能有效攻击多种相机姿态估计模型。

Conclusion: KBA方法在攻击相机姿态估计模型方面表现出色，优化方法进一步提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FTCFormer，通过聚类动态生成视觉token，优化语义特征表示，提升图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer忽视图像区域的语义信息，导致特征表示不理想。

Method: 引入聚类降采样模块、DPC-FKNN机制、SCS评分和Cmerge策略。

Result: 在32个数据集上验证，分类性能显著提升，最高提升1.43%。

Conclusion: FTCFormer通过语义驱动的token生成策略，有效提升图像分类效果。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%
on four remote sensing datasets. The code is available at:

TL;DR: IP-FVR是一种新方法，通过参考图像提供身份条件，结合解耦交叉注意力和反馈学习，解决面部视频恢复中的身份漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在严重退化时难以保留细粒度的身份特征，导致结果缺乏个体特性。

Method: IP-FVR利用参考图像作为视觉提示，采用解耦交叉注意力机制和反馈学习方法，结合余弦相似度和指数混合策略。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，IP-FVR在质量和身份保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IP-FVR在面部视频恢复中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

Method: 提出弱监督流程，利用ChatGPT生成基于FairFace数据集的问答对，构建FairFaceGPT数据集，训练FaceLLM模型。

Result: FaceLLM在多种面部中心任务中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 展示了语言模型合成监督在构建领域专用MLLMs中的潜力，为可信赖、以人为中心的多模态AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

Motivation: 线性投影器在视频MLLMs中导致语义模糊和时间不连贯，而重采样器结构虽有望解决这些问题，但尚未有有效方案。

Method: DisCo包含视觉概念判别器（VCD）模块和时间焦点校准器（TFC）模块，分别确保语义清晰和时间连贯。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM框架上的实验表明，DisCo显著优于现有方法，并在视频理解基准测试中表现优异，同时提高了令牌效率。

Conclusion: DisCo通过独特的模块设计，有效解决了视频MLLMs中的视觉封装问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵且不完整的注释，无法充分捕捉连续手语的复杂性。

Method: 采用双视觉编码器框架，通过对比目标联合对齐视觉和文本嵌入，下游任务中融合视觉特征输入编码器-解码器模型。

Result: 在Phoenix-2014T基准测试中，双编码器架构优于单流变体，并在无注释方法中取得最高BLEU-4分数。

Conclusion: 双视觉编码器框架为无注释手语翻译提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在将视觉基础模型引入特征匹配时忽略了单图像理解与跨图像理解需求之间的不对齐问题，导致多实例特征匹配效果不佳。

Method: IMD框架包括两部分：1) 使用生成式扩散模型捕捉实例级细节；2) 提出跨图像交互提示模块促进图像对间的双向信息交互。

Result: IMD在常用评测基准中达到新SOTA，并在多实例场景的IMIM基准上提升了12%。

Conclusion: IMD通过解决不对齐问题，显著提升了特征匹配性能，特别是在多实例场景中。

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Conclusion: QLIP为扩散模型的高效量化提供了新思路，显著提升了资源受限环境下的实用性。

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Conclusion: FGSSNet通过特征引导显著提升了墙壁分割性能，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了VRGAdapter的有效性。

Conclusion: VRGAdapter提供了一种更通用的适配器解决方案，并通过UMF进一步提升了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有零样本目标检测（ZSD）方法主要针对粗粒度对象，而现实场景中常需区分细粒度对象（如不同鸟类、鱼类和花卉），因此需要解决FG-ZSD问题。

Method: 提出MSHC方法，基于改进的两阶段检测器，采用多级语义感知嵌入对齐损失，确保视觉与语义空间的紧密耦合。

Result: 在构建的FGZSD-Birds数据集上，MSHC方法优于现有ZSD模型。

Conclusion: FG-ZSD是一个重要且具有挑战性的问题，MSHC方法在细粒度检测中表现出色。

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

Conclusion: FOCAL挑战了变换特定训练的必要性假设，为不变性提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,
yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on
predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a
test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging
internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and
optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"
views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes.
Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

Motivation: 卷积神经网络（CNN）在图像分类中偏向于纹理特征，而TDA能捕捉几何信息，弥补这一不足。

Method: 设计了一个TDA特征工程流程，并将拓扑特征与ResNet18结合，用于遥感数据集分类。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上达到99.33%准确率，优于其他大模型；在RESISC45数据集上比基线高1.82%。

Conclusion: TDA特征能与深度学习结合，扩展了TDA的适用性，为遥感分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

TL;DR: 论文提出CrisisLandMark数据集和CLOSP框架，通过多模态对齐提升卫星图像检索性能，并引入地理坐标优化特定任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索系统主要依赖RGB数据，未能充分利用SAR和多光谱数据的独特信息，限制了在灾害响应和气候监测中的应用。

Method: 构建包含64.7万张Sentinel-1 SAR和Sentinel-2多光谱图像的数据集，并提出CLOSP框架，通过对比学习对齐光学和SAR图像到统一嵌入空间。GeoCLOSP进一步整合地理坐标。

Result: CLOSP在检索任务中nDGC提升54%，GeoCLOSP在位置依赖任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多传感器数据和地理上下文的结合对释放遥感档案潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

TL;DR: SC-AGIQA是一个统一框架，通过文本-视觉语义约束提升AI生成图像的质量评估，解决了语义对齐和细节感知的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估AI生成图像时存在语义不对齐和细节感知缺失的问题，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出SC-AGIQA框架，包含文本辅助语义对齐模块（TSAM）和频域细粒度退化感知模块（FFDPM），结合多模态大语言模型和频域分析。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，SC-AGIQA优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SC-AGIQA通过语义约束和频域分析，显著提升了AI生成图像的质量评估能力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏语义关键点，但获取这些关键点耗时且不可靠。

Method: 提出密集特征网络将2D表示映射到SMAL参数，并开发分层对齐策略整合多种视觉线索。

Result: 实验表明4D-Animal优于基线方法，生成的高质量3D资产可应用于其他任务。

Conclusion: 4D-Animal具有大规模应用潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

Motivation: 珊瑚礁是重要但脆弱的生态系统，需要持续监测以支持保护。现有珊瑚礁图像解读依赖专业知识，而VQA技术有望提供用户友好的交互方式。

Method: 开发了一个半自动数据构建流程，结合海洋生物学家确保数据质量和可扩展性，构建了CoralVQA数据集。

Result: 评估了多个先进LVLM模型，揭示了关键局限和机遇，为未来模型开发提供基础。

Conclusion: CoralVQA为珊瑚礁图像中的视觉-语言推理提供了新挑战和基准，支持珊瑚保护工作。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

TL;DR: RAPNet提出了一种基于内容自适应卷积的架构，通过RAPConv和PAN-DFF模块提升遥感图像融合的精度和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在遥感图像融合中因卷积核的均匀应用而忽略局部内容变化，限制了性能。

Method: RAPNet采用RAPConv生成空间自适应卷积核，并结合PAN-DFF模块通过注意力机制平衡空间细节与光谱保真。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RAPNet在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，消融实验验证了自适应组件的有效性。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过自适应卷积和动态特征融合显著提升了遥感图像融合的性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Result: 在各种骨干模型上表现优异，身份保留能力和参考特征转移质量更好。

Conclusion: RefSTAR在盲人脸图像恢复中表现出色，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

Conclusion: GT-Loc通过联合优化时间与地理定位，实现了高效的时间预测和地理定位，为多任务学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且性能优越，代码将公开。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 提出的基准和方法为视网膜异常检测提供了更全面的评估和改进方向，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at

Motivation: 多视角计算机视觉任务中，相机几何关系对3D感知至关重要，需要有效的方法将视觉标记与3D空间关联。

Method: 比较了三种相机条件化方法：标记级光线图编码、注意力级相对位姿编码，以及提出的PRoPE（捕捉完整相机参数）。

Result: 实验表明，相对相机条件化提升了新视角合成的性能，PRoPE进一步带来增益，且在不同任务和模型规模中均有效。

Conclusion: PRoPE在多视角Transformer中表现优异，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

Result: 绘制了莫桑比克全国农田地图，准确区分农田与非农田（93%准确率），农田中位数面积为0.16公顷，83%小于0.5公顷。

Conclusion: 农田规模是农业社会经济与环境影响的关键指标，研究为政策制定提供了重要数据支持。

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高压缩率VQ-VAE的训练计算成本高，需探索更高效的方法。

Method: 利用预训练VAE，结合通道多组量化和后矫正器，减少量化误差。

Result: ReVQ在单GPU上22小时完成训练，图像重建质量高（rFID=1.06）。

Conclusion: ReVQ在效率和重建质量间取得优越平衡，大幅降低训练成本。

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EmRACE-3K数据集，用于评估和改进视觉语言模型在具身环境中的推理能力，展示了当前模型的局限性及改进潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在被动任务中表现良好，但在需要在线交互和主动场景理解的具身环境中表现有限。

Method: 通过构建包含3,000多个任务的EmRACE-3K数据集，并在Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型上进行监督学习和强化学习的微调。

Result: 零样本设置下模型成功率低于20%，微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K为提升具身推理能力提供了有效工具，展示了模型改进的方向。

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Camera traps are revolutionising wildlife monitoring by capturing vast
amounts of visual data; however, the manual identification of individual
animals remains a significant bottleneck. This study introduces a fully
self-supervised approach to learning robust chimpanzee face embeddings from
unlabeled camera-trap footage. Leveraging the DINOv2 framework, we train Vision
Transformers on automatically mined face crops, eliminating the need for
identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification
performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as
Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work
underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

Abstract: Multispectral point cloud (MPC) captures 3D spatial-spectral information from
the observed scene, which can be used for scene understanding and has a wide
range of applications. However, most of the existing classification methods
were extensively tested on indoor datasets, and when applied to outdoor
datasets they still face problems including sparse labeled targets, differences
in land-covers scales, and long-tailed distributions. To address the above
issues, an enhanced classification method based on adaptive multi-scale fusion
for MPCs with long-tailed distributions is proposed. In the training set
generation stage, a grid-balanced sampling strategy is designed to reliably
generate training samples from sparse labeled datasets. In the feature learning
stage, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow features
of land-covers at different scales, addressing the issue of losing fine
features due to scale variations in land-covers. In the classification stage,
an adaptive hybrid loss module is devised to utilize multi-classification heads
with adaptive weights to balance the learning ability of different classes,
improving the classification performance of small classes due to various-scales
and long-tailed distributions in land-covers. Experimental results on three MPC
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的反事实优化方法，用于复杂系统中故障恢复的最优控制策略，应用于海上风力涡轮机变压器，每年可节省约300万欧元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型仅能检测异常，无法提供恢复系统安全状态的最优控制策略，因此需要一种方法在满足系统约束的条件下找到最小调整方案。

Method: 将问题建模为反事实优化问题，利用数学模型在系统约束下找到最优解，应用于海上风力涡轮机变压器。

Result: 在真实数据测试中，方法能灵活适应用户偏好，每年节省约300万欧元。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅拓展了反事实优化的应用领域，还为复杂系统的故障恢复提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine Learning models are increasingly used in businesses to detect faults
and anomalies in complex systems. In this work, we take this approach a step
further: beyond merely detecting anomalies, we aim to identify the optimal
control strategy that restores the system to a safe state with minimal
disruption. We frame this challenge as a counterfactual problem: given a
Machine Learning model that classifies system states as either good or
anomalous, our goal is to determine the minimal adjustment to the system's
control variables (i.e., its current status) that is necessary to return it to
the good state. To achieve this, we leverage a mathematical model that finds
the optimal counterfactual solution while respecting system specific
constraints. Notably, most counterfactual analysis in the literature focuses on
individual cases where a person seeks to alter their status relative to a
decision made by a classifier, such as for loan approval or medical diagnosis.
Our work addresses a fundamentally different challenge: optimizing
counterfactuals for a complex energy system, specifically an offshore wind
turbine oil type transformer. This application not only advances counterfactual
optimization in a new domain but also opens avenues for broader research in
this area. Our tests on real world data provided by our industrial partner show
that our methodology easily adapts to user preferences and brings savings in
the order of 3 million euros per year in a typical farm.

Abstract: Identifying the actual cause of events in engineered systems is a fundamental
challenge in system analysis. Finding such causes becomes more challenging in
the presence of noise and uncertainty in real-world systems. In this paper, we
adopt the notion of probabilistic actual causality by Fenton-Glynn, which is a
probabilistic extension of Halpern and Pearl's actual causality, and propose a
novel method to formally reason about causal effect of events in systems
subject to uncertainty. We (1) formulate the discovery of probabilistic actual
causes in computing systems as an SMT problem, and (2) address the scalability
challenges by introducing an abstraction-refinement technique that
significantly improves efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through three case studies, identifying probabilistic causes of safety
violations in (1) the Mountain Car problem, (2) the Lunar Lander benchmark, and
(3) MPC controller for an F-16 autopilot simulator.

Conclusion: 状态空间平均技术在控制设计中有效，反馈系统在电力电子转换器中表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: This study presents the modeling, control design, and performance analysis of
a DC-DC buck converter using state-space averaging techniques. Buck converters
are essential in modern power electronics for regulating DC voltages in
renewable energy and electric vehicle systems. The paper first introduces the
basic operation of buck converters and emphasizes the need for voltage
regulation through closed-loop control systems. A state-space averaged model is
derived to simplify the nonlinear switched dynamics, enabling a more effective
analysis and controller design. The small-signal transfer function from the
duty cycle to the output voltage is obtained to support control development. In
addition, the Proportional-Integral (PI) control based on the frequency-domain
method was explored. The PI controller was tuned to achieve various phase
margins and is evaluated through Bode plots, step responses, and performance
metrics, revealing trade-offs between overshoot, settling time, and
steady-state error. A complete simulation of the controlled buck converter
verifies its ability to maintain a stable output voltage across wide input
voltage variations. The results validate the effectiveness of state-space
averaging in control design and highlight the robustness of feedback systems in
power electronic converters.

Conclusion: PathFG为路径规划与非线性MPC的整合提供了理论支持，提高了计算效率和系统可靠性。

Abstract: The motion planning problem of generating dynamically feasible,
collision-free trajectories in non-convex environments is a fundamental
challenge for autonomous systems. Decomposing the problem into path planning
and path tracking improves tractability, but integrating these components in a
theoretically sound and computationally efficient manner is challenging. We
propose the Path Feasibility Governor (PathFG), a framework for integrating
path planners with nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC). The PathFG
manipulates the reference passed to the MPC controller, guiding it along a path
while ensuring constraint satisfaction, stability, and recursive feasibility.
The PathFG is modular, compatible with replanning, and improves computational
efficiency and reliability by reducing the need for long prediction horizons.
We prove safety and asymptotic stability with a significantly expanded region
of attraction, and validate its real-time performance through a simulated case
study of quadrotor navigation in a cluttered environment.

Result: 在多达2,383个总线的测试平台上验证了方法的有效性，相比传统方法实现了高达8.8倍的加速。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著减少了计算负担，同时保持了与传统方法相同的约束筛选效果。

Abstract: Power systems Unit Commitment (UC) problem determines the generator
commitment schedule and dispatch decisions to realize the reliable and economic
operation of power networks. The growing penetration of stochastic renewables
and demand behaviors makes it necessary to solve the UC problem timely. It is
possible to derive lightweight, faster-to-solve UC models via constraint
screening to eliminate redundant constraints. However, the screening process
remains computationally cumbersome due to the need of solving numerous linear
programming (LP) problems. To reduce the number of LPs to solve, we introduce a
novel perspective on such classic LP-based screening. Our key insights lie in
the principle that redundant constraints will be satisfied by all vertices of
the screened feasible region. Using the UC decision variables' bounds tightened
by solving much fewer LPs, we build an outer approximation for the UC feasible
region as the screened region. A matrix operation is then designed and applied
to the outer approximation's vertices to identify all redundant constraints
on-the-fly. Adjustments for the outer approximation are further explored to
improve screening efficiency by considering the load operating range and
cutting planes derived from UC cost and discrete unit status prediction.
Extensive simulations are performed on a set of testbeds up to 2,383 buses to
substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Compared to classic
LP-based screening, our schemes can achieve up to 8.8x acceleration while
finding the same redundant constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模随机机组组合问题提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural stochastic optimization method for efficiently
solving the two-stage stochastic unit commitment (2S-SUC) problem under
high-dimensional uncertainty scenarios. The proposed method approximates the
second-stage recourse problem using a deep neural network trained to map
commitment decisions and uncertainty features to recourse costs. The trained
network is subsequently embedded into the first-stage UC problem as a
mixed-integer linear program (MILP), allowing for explicit enforcement of
operational constraints while preserving the key uncertainty characteristics. A
scenario-embedding network is employed to enable dimensionality reduction and
feature aggregation across arbitrary scenario sets, serving as a data-driven
scenario reduction mechanism. Numerical experiments on IEEE 5-bus, 30-bus, and
118-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed neural two-stage stochastic
optimization method achieves solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%,
while enabling orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to conventional MILP
solvers and decomposition-based methods. Moreover, the model's size remains
constant regardless of the number of scenarios, offering significant
scalability for large-scale stochastic unit commitment problems.

Result: 方法在计算上高效，具有优秀的长期预测能力，并通过非线性基准示例验证了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声条件下对非线性系统的建模和预测具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel identification approach of Koopman models of
nonlinear systems with inputs under rather general noise conditions. The method
uses deep state-space encoders based on the concept of state reconstructability
and an efficient multiple-shooting formulation of the squared loss of the
prediction error to estimate the dynamics and the lifted state from
input-output data. Furthermore, the Koopman model structure includes an
innovation noise term that is used to handle process and measurement noise. It
is shown that the proposed approach is statistically consistent and
computationally efficient due to the multiple-shooting formulation where, on
subsections of the data, multi-step prediction errors can be calculated in
parallel. The latter allows for efficient batch optimization of the network
parameters and, at the same time, excellent long-term prediction capabilities
of the obtained models. The performance of the approach is illustrated by
nonlinear benchmark examples.

Result: 模拟研究显示，该方法减少65%的PPI用量，抑酸效果达95%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化PPI治疗提供可行方案，减少治疗负担和过量风险。

Abstract: Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are the standard of care for gastric acid
disorders but carry significant risks when administered chronically at high
doses. Precise long-term control of gastric acidity is challenged by the
impracticality of invasive gastric acid monitoring beyond 72 hours and wide
inter-patient variability. We propose a noninvasive, symptom-based framework
that tailors PPI dosing solely on patient-reported reflux and digestive symptom
patterns. A Bayesian Neural Network prediction model learns to predict patient
symptoms and quantifies its uncertainty from historical symptom scores, meal,
and PPIs intake data. These probabilistic forecasts feed a chance-constrained
Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that dynamically computes future PPI
doses to minimize drug usage while enforcing acid suppression with high
confidence - without any direct acid measurement. In silico studies over
diverse dietary schedules and virtual patient profiles demonstrate that our
learning-augmented MPC reduces total PPI consumption by 65 percent compared to
standard fixed regimens, while maintaining acid suppression with at least 95
percent probability. The proposed approach offers a practical path to
personalized PPI therapy, minimizing treatment burden and overdose risk without
invasive sensors.

Abstract: Public electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is crucial for
accelerating EV adoption and reducing transportation emissions; however,
disparities in infrastructure access have raised significant equity concerns.
This systematic review synthesizes existing knowledge and identifies gaps
regarding equity in EV public charging research. Following structured review
protocols, 91 peer-reviewed studies from Scopus and Google Scholar were
analyzed, focusing explicitly on equity considerations. The findings indicate
that current research on EV public charging equity mainly adopted geographic
information systems (GIS), network optimization, behavioral modeling, and
hybrid analytical frameworks, yet lacks consistent normative frameworks for
assessing equity outcomes. Equity assessments highlight four key dimensions:
spatial accessibility, cost burdens, reliability and usability, and user
awareness and trust. Socio-economic disparities, particularly income, housing
tenure, and ethnicity, frequently exacerbate inequitable access,
disproportionately disadvantaging low-income, renter, and minority populations.
Additionally, infrastructure-specific choices, including charger reliability,
strategic location, and pricing strategies, significantly influence adoption
patterns and equity outcomes. However, existing literature primarily reflects
North American, European, and Chinese contexts, revealing substantial
geographical and methodological limitations. This review suggests the need for
more robust normative evaluations of equity, comprehensive demographic data
integration, and advanced methodological frameworks, thereby guiding targeted,
inclusive, and context-sensitive infrastructure planning and policy
interventions.

Abstract: Optimal power management of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is crucial
for their safe and efficient operation. Numerical optimization techniques are
frequently utilized to solve the optimal power management problems. However,
these techniques often fall short of delivering real-time solutions for
large-scale BESS due to their computational complexity. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a computationally efficient approach. We introduce a new
set of decision variables called power-sharing ratios corresponding to each
cell, indicating their allocated power share from the output power demand. We
then formulate an optimal power management problem to minimize the system-wide
power losses while ensuring compliance with safety, balancing, and power
supply-demand match constraints. To efficiently solve this problem, a
parameterized control policy is designed and leveraged to transform the optimal
power management problem into a parameter estimation problem. We then implement
the ensemble Kalman inversion to estimate the optimal parameter set. The
proposed approach significantly reduces computational requirements due to 1)
the much lower dimensionality of the decision parameters and 2) the estimation
treatment of the optimal power management problem. Finally, we conduct
extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The results show promise in accuracy and computation time compared with
explored numerical optimization techniques.

Conclusion: 拖延策略和阈值强化学习算法是解决此类调度问题的有效方法。

Abstract: We address the problem of optimal joint scheduling of deferrable and
nondeferrable demand involving colocated stochastic supply. Deferrable demand
can be delayed within its service deadline, whereas nondeferrable demand must
be scheduled immediately. Under a finite-horizon stochastic dynamic programming
formulation, we show that the optimal scheduling policy is a ``procrastination
policy'' that delays scheduling as much as possible and is characterized by
three procrastination parameters. Exploiting the low-dimensional
parameterization of the optimal policy, we propose a Procrastination Threshold
Reinforcement Learning algorithm. Numerical experiments based on real-world
test data confirm that the threshold-learning algorithm closely approximates
the optimal policy and outperforms standard benchmarks.

Result: 数值实验表明该方法能高效、稳定地提升控制系统的闭环性能。

Conclusion: MPC-RL-MOBO框架在模型不完美情况下仍能实现高效、安全的学习。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a
structured and interpretable alternative to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL
methods, with lower computational complexity and greater transparency. However,
standard MPC-RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal
policy learning due to limited parameterization, and safety issues during
online adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
that integrates MPC-RL with Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO). The
proposed MPC-RL-MOBO utilizes noisy evaluations of the RL stage cost and its
gradient, estimated via a Compatible Deterministic Policy Gradient (CDPG)
approach, and incorporates them into a MOBO algorithm using the Expected
Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function. This fusion enables
efficient and safe tuning of the MPC parameters to achieve improved closed-loop
performance, even under model imperfections. A numerical example demonstrates
the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving sample-efficient,
stable, and high-performance learning for control systems.

  As renewable energy needs to be sustainable for it to fully support the

improved and enhanced. Smart systems are considered the next generation
technological improvement of any system that exists. It is the prelude to
autonomous systems from industrial applications to home automation. Data
acquisition is only a part of these smart systems that help in the remote
management and control of these devices. Remote monitoring functionality
enhances the operation and reliability which help in making proactive decisions
during critical situations and circumstances.
  Even with data acquisition enhancements, there is still room for improving
its implementation regarding data security and privacy and accuracy of
information being exchanged between nodes. Current technological advancements
have already shown promising results and have widen its utilization spectrum by
covering almost any field of specialization. With increasing implementation and

challenging due to the disparity in performance metrics between communication
and sensing-mutual information (MI) versus beam-pattern mean-squared error
(MSE) or the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). To overcome this, we propose a
low-complexity greedy RF chain selection framework maximizing a unified
MI-based performance metric applicable to both functions. By decomposing the
total MI into individual contributions of each RF chain, we introduce two
approaches: greedy eigen-based selection (GES) and greedy cofactor-based
selection (GCS), which iteratively identify and remove the RF chains with the
lowest contribution. We further extend our framework to beam selection for
beamspace MIMO ISAC systems, introducing diagonal beam selection (DBS) as a
simplified solution. Simulation results show that our proposed methods achieve
near-optimal performance with significantly lower complexity than exhaustive
search, demonstrating their practical effectiveness for MIMO ISAC systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a trust-based predictive multi-agent consensus protocol
that analyses neighbours' anticipation data and makes coordination decisions.
Agents in the network share their future predicted data over a finite
look-ahead horizon with their neighbours and update their predictions in a
rolling-horizon fashion. The prediction data is then used by agents to learn
both the trust and the commitment traits exhibited by their neighbours over
time. The proposed protocol is named as the Anticipatory Distributed
Coordination (ADC) protocol. Lyapunov theory-based agreement convergence
between agents is provided, followed by demonstrations using numerical
simulations.

Abstract: The angular droop control is a grid-forming control strategy that exploits
the idea of power-to-angle droop to achieve exact frequency synchronization
with no stringent separation between primary and secondary frequency control.
In this work, we conduct hardware experiments in the Smart Energy System
Control Laboratory at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) to test and
validate the angular droop control for low voltage power grids in two different
test scenarios. First, we verify its grid-forming capabilities after a major
event, e.g., following a blackout, demonstrated via power-to-angle droop
behavior. For this, we propose two implementation schemes that rely either on
direct or indirect actuation of the modulation signal and draw a comparison
between them. Second, we investigate the plug-and-play capabilities, i.e.,
local stability and power sharing for a two-converter system and provide
suitable tuning for the control gains. Our experimental findings illustrate the
usefulness of hardware test and validation for DC/AC converter control, the
practical challenges entailed and the proposed remedies.

Abstract: Uncertainties influencing the dynamical systems pose a significant challenge
in estimating the achievable performance of a controller aiming to control such
uncertain systems. When the uncertainties are of stochastic nature, obtaining
hard guarantees for the robustness of a controller aiming to hedge against the
uncertainty is not possible. This issue set the platform for the development of
probabilistic robust control approaches. In this work, we utilise the gap
metric between the known nominal model and the unknown perturbed model of the
uncertain system as a tool to gauge the robustness of a controller and
formulate the gap as a random variable in the setting with stochastic
uncertainties. Main results of this paper includes giving probabilistic bound
on the gap exceeding a known threshold followed by bounds on the expected gap
value and probabilistic robust stability in terms of the gap metric. Further,
we also provide a probabilistic controller performance certification under gap
uncertainty and probabilistic guarantee on the achievable
$\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ robustness. Numerical simulations are provided at many
places to demonstrate the proposed approach.

Method: 论文分为两部分：介绍AI概念及其在电力系统分析与设计中的应用；讨论基于AI的故障诊断方法。

Result: AI技术在电力系统故障诊断中展现出巨大潜力，但存在数据需求高和耗时等挑战。

Conclusion: AI方法为电力系统故障诊断提供了新思路，但仍需进一步研究以克服其局限性。

Abstract: Components of electrical power systems are susceptible to failures caused by
lightning strikes, aging or human errors. These faults can cause equipment
damage, affect system reliability, and results in expensive repair costs. As
electric power systems are becoming more complex, traditional protection
methods face limitations and shortcomings. Faults in power systems can occur at
anytime and anywhere, can be caused by a natural disaster or an accident, and
their occurrence can be hardly predicted or avoided; therefore, it is crucial
to accurately estimate the fault location and quickly restore service. The
development of methods capable of accurately detecting, locating and removing
faults is essential (i.e. fast isolation of faults is necessary to maintain the
system stability at transmission levels; accurate and fast detection and
location of faults are essential for increasing reliability and customer
satisfaction at distribution levels). This has motivated the development of new
and more efficient methods. Methods developed to detect and locate faults in
power systems can be divided into two categories, conventional and artificial
intelligence-based techniques. Although the utilization of artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques offer tremendous potential, they are challenging
and time consuming (i.e. many AI techniques require training data for
processing). This paper presents a survey of the application of AI techniques
to fault diagnosis (detection, classification and location of faults) of lines
and cables of power systems at both transmission and distribution levels. The
paper provides a short introduction to AI concepts, a brief summary of the
application of AI techniques to power system analysis and design, and a
discussion on AI-based fault diagnosis methods.

Motivation: 现有文献对电池最优放置的理解不足，尤其是网络拓扑对发电成本最小化的影响。

Method: 将混合整数线性规划（MILP）分解为一系列线性规划（LP）问题，推导出在特定条件下加权度是唯一影响最优放置的拓扑因素。

Result: 在树状拓扑网络中，加权度是主要影响因素；设计的低复杂度算法比商业求解器快约100倍且保持高精度。

Conclusion: 电池的局部影响随网络规模扩大而减弱，算法在弱循环网络中高效且准确。

Abstract: We study the optimal placement of an unlimited-capacity battery in power
grids under a centralized market model, where the independent system operator
(ISO) aims to minimize total generation costs through load shifting. The
optimal battery placement is not well understood by the existing literature,
especially regarding the influence of network topology on minimizing generation
costs. Our work starts with decomposing the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) problem into a series of Linear Programming (LP) formulations. For power
grids with sufficiently large generation capacity or tree topologies, we derive
analytical cost expressions demonstrating that, under reasonable assumptions,
the weighted degree is the only topological factor for optimal battery
placement. We also discuss the minor impact of higher-order topological
conditions on tree-topology networks. To find the localized nature of a single
battery's impact, we establish that the relative cost-saving benefit of a
single battery decreases as the network scales. Furthermore, we design a
low-complexity algorithm for weakly-cyclic networks. Numerical experiments show
that our algorithm is not only approximately 100 times faster than commercial
solvers but also maintains high accuracy even when some theoretical assumptions
are relaxed.

fusion from inductive loops, GPS probes, and toll records. The model is

Abstract: This work presents several improvements to the closed-loop stability
verification framework using semialgebraic sets and convex semidefinite
programming to examine neural-network-based control systems regulating
nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the utility of the framework is greatly
expanded: two semialgebraic functions mimicking common, smooth activation
functions are presented and compatibility with control systems incorporating
Recurrent Equilibrium Networks (RENs) and thereby Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) is established. Second, the validity of the framework's state-of-the-art
stability analyses is established via an alternate proof. Third, based on this
proof, two new optimization problems simplifying the analysis of local
stability properties are presented. To simplify the analysis of a closed-loop
system's Region of Attraction (RoA), the first problem explicitly parameterizes
a class of candidate Lyapunov functions larger than in previous works. The
second problem utilizes the unique guarantees available under the condition of
invariance to further expand the set of candidate Lyapunov functions and
directly determine whether an invariant set forms part of the system's RoA.
These contributions are successfully demonstrated in two numerical examples and
suggestions for future research are provided.

Abstract: Creating high-quality anime illustrations presents notable challenges,

specifically designed for anime illustrations to address this issue. It offers
real-time guidance to help users refine their work and streamline the creative

images into rough sketches, which are further refined into structured guidance
sketches using a custom-designed optimizer. The proposed system offers precise,
real-time guidance aligned with the creative intent of the user, significantly
enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of the drawing process. To assess
the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a user study, gathering
empirical feedback on both system performance and interface usability.

Conclusion: 该方法结合生成模型与物理编辑，实现了直观且物理合理的矢量场设计。

Abstract: Fluid simulation techniques are widely used in various fields such as film
production, but controlling complex fluid behaviors remains challenging. While
recent generative models enable intuitive generation of vector fields from user
sketches, they struggle to maintain physical properties such as
incompressibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for
interactively designing 2D vector fields. Conventional generative models can
intuitively generate vector fields from user sketches, but remain difficult to
consider physical properties. Therefore, we add a simple editing process after
generating the vector field. In the first stage, we use a latent diffusion
model~(LDM) to automatically generate initial 2D vector fields from user
sketches. In the second stage, we apply the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition to
locally extract physical properties such as incompressibility from the results
generated by LDM and recompose them according to user intentions. Through
multiple experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models often suffers from
energy instabilities and guidance artifacts that degrade visual quality. We
analyze the latent energy landscape during sampling and propose adaptive

modulate guidance strength over time, achieving superior stability scores

yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while
reducing artifacts. Our energy profiling framework serves as a powerful
diagnostic tool for understanding and improving diffusion model behavior.

Abstract: We propose a real-time method for reactive motion synthesis based on the
known trajectory of input character, predicting instant reactions using only
historical, user-controlled motions. Our method handles the uncertainty of
future movements by introducing an intention predictor, which forecasts key
joint intentions to make pose prediction more deterministic from the historical
interaction. The intention is later encoded into the latent space of its
reactive motion, matched with a codebook which represents mappings between
input and output. It samples a categorical distribution for pose generation and
strengthens model robustness through adversarial training. Unlike previous
offline approaches, the system can recursively generate intentions and reactive
motions using feedback from earlier steps, enabling real-time, long-term
realistic interactive synthesis. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
show our approach outperforms other matching-based motion synthesis approaches,
delivering superior stability and generalizability. In our method, user can
also actively influence the outcome by controlling the moving directions,
creating a personalized interaction path that deviates from predefined
trajectories.

Conclusion: CADmium方法展示了文本条件CAD生成的可行性，并提供了数据集和模型供公开使用。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects,
and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications
like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains
largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate
this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence
representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the
potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this
work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models
annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our
pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs
to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural
language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this
approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail
to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and
topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler
characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and
ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that
CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of
new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity real-time animated sequences of photorealistic 3D
head avatars is important for many graphics applications, including immersive
telepresence and movies. This is a challenging problem particularly when
rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures
and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads,
including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple
locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable
creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In
contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we
condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and
synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a
patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how
to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling
the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene
representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians
on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ
color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality
results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By
leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing
diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.

Conclusion: 预计算主导资源公平性算法在保持DRF理想特性的同时，提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Although resource allocation is a well studied problem in computer science,
until the prevalence of distributed systems, such as computing clouds and data
centres, the question had been addressed predominantly for single resource type
scenarios. At the beginning of the last decade, with the introuction of
Dominant Resource Fairness, the studies of the resource allocation problem has
finally extended to the multiple resource type scenarios. Dominant Resource
Fairness is a solution, addressing the problem of fair allocation of multiple
resource types, among users with heterogeneous demands. Based on Max-min
Fairness, which is a well established algorithm in the literature for
allocating resources in the single resource type scenarios, Dominant Resource
Fairness generalises the scheme to the multiple resource case. It has a number
of desirable properties that makes it preferable over alternatives, such as
Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, Pareto Efficiency, and Strategy Proofness,
and as such, it is widely adopted in distributed systems. In the present study,
we revisit the original study, and analyse the structure of the algorithm in
closer view, to come up with an alternative algorithm, which approximates the
Dominant Resource Fairness allocation in fewer steps. We name the new algorithm
Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness, after its main working principle.

Conclusion: 多轮双边协商策略有助于提高云资源利用率和定制化服务，研究为行业实施提供了指导。

Abstract: Today, static cloud markets where consumers purchase services directly from
providers are dominating. Thus, consumers neither negotiate the price nor the
characteristics of the service. In recent years, providers have adopted more
dynamic trading mechanisms, as e.g. Amazon's EC2 platform shows: In addition to
the reservation marketspace and the on-demand marketspace, Amazon offers a spot
marketspace where consumers can bid for virtual machines. This spot marketspace
was extended with spot blocks, and recently Amazon reworked the bidding
options. In addition, other cloud providers, such as Virtustream, adopt dynamic
trading mechanisms. The scientific community envisions autonomous multi-round
negotiations for realizing future cloud marketspaces. Consequently, consumers
and providers exchange offers and counteroffers to reach an agreement. This
helps providers increase the utilization of their datacenters, while consumers
can purchase highly customized cloud services.
  In the paper at hand, we present a survey on multi-round bilateral
negotiation strategies for trading cloud resources. Thus, we analyzed
peer-reviewed articles in order to identify trends, gaps, similarities, and the
scope of such negotiation strategies. In addition, we surveyed the formalism
that the scientific community uses to describe such strategies. Based on these
findings, we derived recommendations for creating and documenting bilateral
multi-round negotiation strategies to foster their implementation in the

Result: LLMs表现出风险厌恶行为，接近理论预测，受赢家诅咒影响；提示设计影响有限，但可通过思维模型改进。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为拍卖实验的低成本代理，为拍卖设计和研究提供新工具。

Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of simulated AI agents (large language
models, or LLMs) in auctions, introducing a novel synthetic data-generating
process to help facilitate the study and design of auctions. We find that LLMs
-- when endowed with chain of thought reasoning capacity -- agree with the
experimental literature in auctions across a variety of classic auction
formats. In particular, we find that LLM bidders produce results consistent
with risk-averse human bidders; that they perform closer to theoretical
predictions in obviously strategy-proof auctions; and, that they succumb to the
winner's curse in common value settings. On prompting, we find that LLMs are
not very sensitive to naive changes in prompts (e.g., language, currency) but
can improve dramatically towards theoretical predictions with the right mental
model (i.e., the language of Nash deviations). We run 1,000$+$ auctions for
less than $\$$400 with GPT-4 models (three orders of magnitude cheaper than
modern auction experiments) and develop a framework flexible enough to run
auction experiments with any LLM model and a wide range of auction design
specifications, facilitating further experimental study by decreasing costs and
serving as a proof-of-concept for the use of LLM proxies.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by applications such as cloud platforms allocating GPUs to users or
governments deploying mobile health units across competing regions, we study
the dynamic allocation of a reusable resource to strategic agents with private
valuations. Our objective is to simultaneously (i) maximize social welfare,
(ii) satisfy multi-dimensional long-term cost constraints, and (iii)
incentivize truthful reporting. We begin by numerically evaluating primal-dual
methods widely used in constrained online optimization and find them to be
highly fragile in strategic settings -- agents can easily manipulate their
reports to distort future dual updates for future gain.
  To address this vulnerability, we develop an incentive-aware framework that
makes primal-dual methods robust to strategic behavior. Our design combines
epoch-based lazy updates -- where dual variables remain fixed within each epoch
-- with randomized exploration rounds that extract approximately truthful
signals for learning. Leveraging carefully designed online learning subroutines
that can be of independent interest for dual updates, our mechanism achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ social welfare regret, satisfies all cost
constraints, and ensures incentive alignment. This matches the performance of
non-strategic allocation approaches while being robust to strategic agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不可分割家务分配中的公平和效率问题，填补EF1和PO分配方案是否存在的理论空白。

Method: 采用固定点论证和离散算法结合的方法，证明了EF1和PO分配的存在性，并扩展到fPO和加权EF1。

Result: 证明了EF1和PO分配的存在性，并展示了在常数代理数下可多项式时间计算。

Conclusion: 论文填补了理论空白，提供了方法论创新，并扩展了结果到更一般的加权EF1场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of allocating indivisible chores among agents with
additive cost functions in a fair and efficient manner. A major open question
in this area is whether there always exists an allocation that is envy-free up
to one chore (EF1) and Pareto optimal (PO). Our main contribution is to provide
a positive answer to this question by proving the existence of such an
allocation for indivisible chores under additive cost functions. This is
achieved by a novel combination of a fixed point argument and a discrete
algorithm, providing a significant methodological advance in this area.
  Our additional key contributions are as follows. We show that there always
exists an allocation that is EF1 and fractional Pareto optimal (fPO), where fPO
is a stronger efficiency concept than PO. We also show that an EF1 and PO
allocation can be computed in polynomial time when the number of agents is
constant. Finally, we extend all of these results to the more general setting
of weighted EF1 (wEF1), which accounts for the entitlements of agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究虚构博弈（FP）在零和游戏中的收敛速率，验证Karlin的猜想是否成立。

Method: 通过构造一个10x10的零和矩阵游戏，分析FP的收敛行为，特别关注无平局情况。

Result: 发现FP的收敛速率为Ω(t^{-1/3})，否定了Karlin的O(t^{-1/2})猜想。

Conclusion: Karlin的猜想在较弱形式下也不成立，FP的收敛速率可能比预期更慢。

Abstract: Fictitious play (FP) is a natural learning dynamic in two-player zero-sum
games. Samuel Karlin conjectured in 1959 that FP converges at a rate of
$O(t^{-1/2})$ to Nash equilibrium, where $t$ is the number of steps played.
However, Daskalakis and Pan disproved the stronger form of this conjecture in
2014, where \emph{adversarial} tie-breaking is allowed.
  This paper disproves Karlin's conjecture in its weaker form. In particular,
there exists a 10-by-10 zero-sum matrix game, in which FP converges at a rate
of $\Omega(t^{-1/3})$, and no ties occur except for the first step.

Motivation: 研究有限理性代理在一般和博弈中的行为，提出更通用的解决方案。

Method: 使用平滑正则化期望效用，通过模拟生成梯度估计，采用Frank-Wolfe算法进行学习。

Result: 在确保均衡唯一性的条件下，算法有效收敛，并在复杂博弈中表现优异。

Conclusion: GQRE为有限理性代理提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于多种复杂博弈场景。

Abstract: We introduce a new solution concept for bounded rational agents in finite
normal-form general-sum games called Generalized Quantal Response Equilibrium
(GQRE) which generalizes Quantal Response
Equilibrium~\citep{mckelvey1995quantal}. In our setup, each player maximizes a
smooth, regularized expected utility of the mixed profiles used, reflecting
bounded rationality that subsumes stochastic choice. After establishing
existence under mild conditions, we present computationally efficient no-regret
independent learning via smoothened versions of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Our
algorithm uses noisy but correlated gradient estimates generated via a
simulation oracle that reports on repeated plays of the game. We analyze
convergence properties of our algorithm under assumptions that ensure
uniqueness of equilibrium, using a class of gap functions that generalize the
Nash gap. We end by demonstrating the effectiveness of our method on a set of
complex general-sum games such as high-rank two-player games, large action
two-player games, and known examples of difficult multi-player games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息泛滥、AI生成内容激增以及传统新闻来源信任度下降，需要一种新的内容真实性验证方法。

Method: 利用智能合约和数字身份，将‘信任’纳入内容发布的奖励机制，通过社区治理模型和财务抵押机制激励用户参与事实核查。

Result: 假设通过合理的财务和社会激励模型，用户会积极参与众包事实核查，内容创作者会更谨慎地发表声明。

Conclusion: 本文为探索性研究，提出了一个潜在的新范式，但仍有许多开放性问题需要进一步分析和探索。

Abstract: This paper outlines an incentive-driven and decentralized approach to
verifying the veracity of digital content at scale. Widespread misinformation,
an explosion in AI-generated content and reduced reliance on traditional news
sources demands a new approach for content authenticity and truth-seeking that
is fit for a modern, digital world. By using smart contracts and digital
identity to incorporate 'trust' into the reward function for published content,
not just engagement, we believe that it could be possible to foster a
self-propelling paradigm shift to combat misinformation through a
community-based governance model. The approach described in this paper requires
that content creators stake financial collateral on factual claims for an
impartial jury to vet with a financial reward for contribution. We hypothesize
that with the right financial and social incentive model users will be
motivated to participate in crowdsourced fact-checking and content creators
will place more care in their attestations. This is an exploratory paper and
there are a number of open issues and questions that warrant further analysis
and exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于拍卖的系统（如CoWSwap）存在不足，需要一种更高效且资本保护的方法来完成CoW周期。

Method: 采用资产矩阵公式，结合预言机价格和守恒定律验证可行性，并通过图遍历和失衡校正完成部分CoW周期。

Result: 在Arbitrum实际交易数据中验证了算法的有效性，能够高效发现CoW周期并支持原子性闭合。

Conclusion: 该方法为流动性提供者提供了一种无滑点且资本保护的策略，实现了结构化CoW周期执行。

Abstract: We propose a mathematically rigorous framework for identifying and completing
Coincidence of Wants (CoW) cycles in decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators.
Unlike existing auction based systems such as CoWSwap, our approach introduces
an asset matrix formulation that not only verifies feasibility using oracle
prices and formal conservation laws but also completes partial CoW cycles of
swap orders that are discovered using graph traversal and are settled using
imbalance correction. We define bridging orders and show that the resulting
execution is slippage free and capital preserving for LPs. Applied to real
world Arbitrum swap data, our algorithm demonstrates efficient discovery of CoW
cycles and supports the insertion of synthetic orders for atomic cycle closure.
This work can be thought of as the detailing of a potential delta-neutral
strategy by liquidity providing market makers: a structured CoW cycle
execution.

Method: 通过理论分析，证明了双时钟WTGs在非负权重和时间限制下的值问题是不可判定的。

Result: 双时钟WTGs的值问题在非负权重和时间限制下是不可判定的。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了WTGs算法理解中的最后一个主要空白，为相关领域提供了重要结论。

Abstract: The Value Problem for weighted timed games (WTGs) consists in determining,
given a two-player weighted timed game with a reachability objective and a
rational threshold, whether or not the value of the game exceeds the threshold.
This problem was shown to be undecidable some ten years ago for WTGs making use
of at least three clocks, and is known to be decidable for single-clock WTGs.
In this paper, we establish undecidability for two-clock WTGs making use of
non-negative weights, even in a time-bounded setting, closing the last
remaining major gap in our algorithmic understanding of WTGs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“认知失调AI（CD-AI）”的新框架，旨在通过维持不确定性而非解决它，促进用户的批判性思维和适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统通过最小化认知负荷和优化效率来简化决策，但可能导致被动接受和认知控制。CD-AI旨在通过主动维持认知失调，激发用户的批判性思维和适应能力。

Method: 论文介绍了CD-AI的理论基础、实现模型，并探讨了其在伦理、法律、政治和科学等领域的应用。

Result: CD-AI通过延迟决策和促进辩证思维，增强了反思推理、认知谦逊和批判性思维。

Conclusion: CD-AI挑战了传统AI的确定性范式，提出了一种通过维持认知冲突来提升思维能力的AI设计新愿景。

Abstract: AI-augmented systems are traditionally designed to streamline human
decision-making by minimizing cognitive load, clarifying arguments, and
optimizing efficiency. However, in a world where algorithmic certainty risks
becoming an Orwellian tool of epistemic control, true intellectual growth
demands not passive acceptance but active struggle. Drawing on the dystopian
visions of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick - where reality is unstable,
perception malleable, and truth contested - this paper introduces Cognitive
Dissonance AI (CD-AI): a novel framework that deliberately sustains uncertainty
rather than resolving it. CD-AI does not offer closure, but compels users to
navigate contradictions, challenge biases, and wrestle with competing truths.
By delaying resolution and promoting dialectical engagement, CD-AI enhances
reflective reasoning, epistemic humility, critical thinking, and adaptability
in complex decision-making. This paper examines the theoretical foundations of
the approach, presents an implementation model, explores its application in
domains such as ethics, law, politics, and science, and addresses key ethical
concerns - including decision paralysis, erosion of user autonomy, cognitive
manipulation, and bias in AI reasoning. In reimagining AI as an engine of doubt
rather than a deliverer of certainty, CD-AI challenges dominant paradigms of
AI-augmented reasoning and offers a new vision - one in which AI sharpens the
mind not by resolving conflict, but by sustaining it. Rather than reinforcing
Huxleyan complacency or pacifying the user into intellectual conformity, CD-AI
echoes Nietzsche's vision of the Uebermensch - urging users to transcend
passive cognition through active epistemic struggle.

Motivation: 传统心脏骤停培训方法难以模拟真实事件的动态性，阻碍了CRM技能的培养。

Method: iREACT提供非线性、协作的环境，团队需应对变化的患者状态，同时捕获多模态数据并提供实时和事后反馈。

Result: 初步评估显示iREACT具有可用性和教育价值，可提升CRM评估效果。

Conclusion: iREACT在心脏骤停培训中表现出潜力，并可扩展至其他高风险场景，以改善团队协作和决策能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces iREACT, a novel VR simulation addressing key
limitations in traditional cardiac arrest (CA) training. Conventional methods
struggle to replicate the dynamic nature of real CA events, hindering Crew
Resource Management (CRM) skill development. iREACT provides a non-linear,
collaborative environment where teams respond to changing patient states,
mirroring real CA complexities. By capturing multi-modal data (user actions,
cognitive load, visual gaze) and offering real-time and post-session feedback,
iREACT enhances CRM assessment beyond traditional methods. A formative
evaluation with medical experts underscores its usability and educational
value, with potential applications in other high-stakes training scenarios to
improve teamwork, communication, and decision-making.

Abstract: Adolescents increasingly rely on online technologies to explore their
identities, form social connections, and access information and entertainment.
However, their growing digital engagement exposes them to significant online
risks, particularly in underrepresented contexts like West Africa. This study
investigates the online experiences of 409 secondary school adolescents in
Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory (FCT), focusing on their access to
technology, exposure to risks, coping strategies, key stakeholders influencing
their online interactions, and recommendations for improving online safety.
Using self-administered surveys, we found that while most adolescents reported
moderate access to online technology and connectivity, those who encountered
risks frequently reported exposure to inappropriate content and online scams.
Blocking and reporting tools were the most commonly used strategies, though
some adolescents responded with inaction due to limited resources or awareness.
Parents emerged as the primary support network, though monitoring practices and
communication varied widely. Guided by Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), our
analysis interprets adolescents' online safety behaviors as shaped by both
their threat perceptions and their confidence in available coping strategies. A
thematic analysis of their recommendations highlights the need for greater
awareness and education, parental mediation, enhanced safety tools, stricter
age restrictions, improved content moderation, government accountability, and
resilience-building initiatives. Our findings underscore the importance of
culturally and contextually relevant interventions to empower adolescents in
navigating the digital world, with implications for parents, educators,
designers, and policymakers.

Abstract: As we move towards a future of autonomous vehicles, questions regarding their
method of communication have arisen. One of the common questions concerns the
placement of the signaling used to communicate with pedestrians and road users,
but little work has been published fully dedicated to exploring this. This
paper uses a simulation made in the Unity game engine to record the visibility
of fifteen different vehicles, specifically regarding the visibility of frontal
elements by a pedestrian on the sidewalk. Variables include the vehicle
position, number of vehicles on the road, and minimum and maximum distance of
the recorded points. It was concluded that the areas of the vehicle most often
seen by pedestrians on the sidewalk attempting to cross the road were the
frontal frontal fenders and the headlights, with the frontal wheels, frontal
doors, bumper, and side mirrors are less visible alternatives. These findings
are valuable in the future design of signaling for autonomous vehicles, in
order to ensure pedestrians are able to see them on approaching vehicles. The
software used provides a platform for similar works in the future to be
conducted.

Abstract: In decision-making conversations, experts must navigate complex choices and
make on-the-spot decisions while engaged in conversation. Although extensive
historical data often exists, the real-time nature of these scenarios makes it
infeasible for decision-makers to review and leverage relevant information.
This raises an interesting question: What if experts could utilize relevant
past data in real-time decision-making through insights derived from past data?
To explore this, we implemented a conversational user interface, taking
doctor-patient interactions as an example use case. Our system continuously
listens to the conversation, identifies patient problems and doctor-suggested
solutions, and retrieves related data from an embedded dataset, generating
concise insights using a pipeline built around a retrieval-based Large Language
Model (LLM) agent. We evaluated the prototype by embedding Health Canada
datasets into a vector database and conducting simulated studies using sample
doctor-patient dialogues, showing effectiveness but also challenges, setting
directions for the next steps of our work.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于移动设备的无密码认证方法，通过智能手机或智能手表确认PC登录请求，替代传统密码认证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密码认证存在认知负担和弱凭证问题，现代移动设备具备高级安全功能，可用于改进PC认证。

Method: 采用基于令牌的无密码认证，用户在移动设备上确认或拒绝PC的认证请求，测试了按钮点击和生物指纹验证两种方式。

Result: 智能手表认证在认证时长上优于密码和智能手机认证，成功率相当，且用户评价其可用性最高。

Conclusion: 智能手表认证是一种高效且用户友好的PC认证替代方案。

Abstract: Protecting personal computers (PCs) from unauthorized access typically relies
on password authentication, which is know to suffer from cognitive burden and
weak credentials. As many users nowadays carry mobile devices with advanced
security features throughout their day, there is an opportunity to leverage
these devices to improve authentication to PCs. In this paper we utilize a
token-based passwordless approach where users authenticate to their PC by
confirming the authentication request on their smartphones or smartwatches.
Upon a request to login to the PC, or to evaluate privileges, the PC issues an
authentication request that users receive on their mobile devices, where users
can confirm or deny the request. We evaluate button tap and biometric
fingerprint verification as confirmation variants, and compare their
authentication duration, success rate, and usability to traditional
password-based authentication in a user study with 30 participants and a total
of 1,200 authentication attempts. Smartwatch-based authentication outperformed
password-based authentication and smartphone-based variants in authentication
duration, while showing comparable success rates. Participants rated
smartwatch-based authentication highest in usability, followed by
password-based authentication and smartphone-based authentication.

Result: 发现EEG与自我报告方法在任务难度和测量结果上存在显著差异，提示无意识认知努力的存在。

Conclusion: EEG方法能捕捉自我报告无法反映的认知负荷，为心理负荷评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of mental workload (MW) is crucial for understanding
cognitive processes during visualization tasks. While EEG-based measures are
emerging as promising alternatives to conventional assessment techniques, such
as selfreport measures, studies examining consistency across these different
methodologies are limited. In a preliminary study, we observed indications of
potential discrepancies between EEGbased and self-reported MW measures.
Motivated by these preliminary observations, our study further explores the
discrepancies between EEG-based and self-reported MW assessment methods through
an experiment involving visualization tasks. In the experiment, we employ two
benchmark tasks: the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) and a
Spatial Visualization (SV) task. EEG signals are recorded from participants
using a 32-channel system at a sampling rate of 128 Hz during the visualization
tasks. For each participant, MW is estimated using an EEG-based model built on
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture, and these estimates are compared
with conventional MW measures to examine potential discrepancies. Our findings
reveal notable discrepancies between task difficulty and EEG-based MW
estimates, as well as between EEG-based and self-reported MW measures across
varying task difficulty levels. Additionally, the observed patterns suggest the
presence of unconscious cognitive effort that may not be captured by selfreport
alone.

planning platforms exhibit inefficiencies in flexibly interacting with the road
network's structure and attributes and intuitively comparing multiple states
during the iterative planning process. This paper introduces TraSculptor, an
interactive planning decision-making system. To develop TraSculptor, we
identify and address two challenges: interactive modification of road networks
and intuitive comparison of multiple network states. For the first challenge,
we establish flexible interactions to enable experts to easily and directly
modify the road network on the map. For the second challenge, we design a
comparison view with a history tree of multiple states and a road-state matrix
to facilitate intuitive comparison of road network states. To evaluate
TraSculptor, we provided a usage scenario where the Braess's paradox was
showcased, invited experts to perform a case study on the Sioux Falls network,
and collected expert feedback through interviews.

*Hrittika Bhowmick,Shilpaa Anand*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文批判了以视觉为中心的原型设计文化，提倡从盲人学者的生活经验和文化残疾研究中汲取见解，重新定义原型设计为一种情境化、具身化和关系化的实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨原型设计文化中对视觉的过度依赖如何边缘化其他感知和制作方式，尤其是对盲人学者的影响。

Method: 通过盲人学者的生活经验和文化残疾研究的视角，分析原型设计中的视觉中心主义。

Result: 揭示了原型设计中视觉中心主义的局限性，并提出了一种更具包容性的原型设计方法。

Conclusion: 呼吁HCI领域重新思考原型设计的定义，以更广泛地包容多样化的设计参与方式。

Abstract: Prototyping is widely regarded in Human-Computer Interaction as an iterative
process through which ideas are tested and refined, often via visual mockups,
screen flows, and coded simulations. This position paper critiques the
visual-centric norms embedded in prototyping culture by drawing from the lived
experiences of blind scholars and insights from cultural disability studies. It
discusses how dominant methods of prototyping rely on an unexamined fidelity to
sight, privileging what can be rendered visibly coherent while marginalizing
other modes of knowing and making. By repositioning prototyping as a situated,
embodied, and relational practice, this paper challenges HCI to rethink what
kinds of design participation are legitimized and which are excluded when
prototyping is reduced to screen-based simulations.

TL;DR: 论文提出Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA)框架，通过分解生成过程为多个任务对齐的中间表示，恢复编程的核心功能，同时保留自然语言的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的编程提示方式为非程序员（如教育工作者）提供了便利，但绕过了直接编写代码，导致编程的核心功能（如可追溯性、逐步优化和行为测试）丢失。

Method: 提出CoA框架，将合成过程分解为一系列认知上有意义的中间表示，并在SimStep环境中实现，支持教师通过四个中间抽象创建模拟内容。

Result: 评估表明，CoA在编程提示工作流中提供了更高的创作控制和可解释性。

Conclusion: CoA框架在保留自然语言灵活性的同时，恢复了编程的核心功能，为非程序员提供了更可控和可解释的编程体验。

Abstract: Programming-by-prompting with generative AI offers a new paradigm for
end-user programming, shifting the focus from syntactic fluency to semantic
intent. This shift holds particular promise for non-programmers such as
educators, who can describe instructional goals in natural language to generate
interactive learning content. Yet in bypassing direct code authoring, many of
programming's core affordances - such as traceability, stepwise refinement, and
behavioral testing - are lost. We propose the Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA)
framework as a way to recover these affordances while preserving the expressive
flexibility of natural language. CoA decomposes the synthesis process into a
sequence of cognitively meaningful, task-aligned representations that function
as checkpoints for specification, inspection, and refinement. We instantiate
this approach in SimStep, an authoring environment for teachers that scaffolds
simulation creation through four intermediate abstractions: Concept Graph,
Scenario Graph, Learning Goal Graph, and UI Interaction Graph. To address
ambiguities and misalignments, SimStep includes an inverse correction process
that surfaces in-filled model assumptions and enables targeted revision without
requiring users to manipulate code. Evaluations with educators show that CoA
enables greater authoring control and interpretability in
programming-by-prompting workflows.

TL;DR: VolumeSTCube是一种新的技术框架，用于连续时空现象的可视化，解决了空间时间立方体（STC）的视觉遮挡和深度模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管STC在时空数据可视化中表现优异，但其视觉遮挡和深度模糊问题在大规模数据中尤为突出，需要新的解决方案。

Method: VolumeSTCube将离散的时空数据转换为连续的体积数据，结合体积渲染和表面渲染技术，并设计了交互功能。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，VolumeSTCube在大规模时空数据分析中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VolumeSTCube有效解决了STC的局限性，为时空数据分析提供了更优的可视化工具。

Abstract: Spatial time series visualization offers scientific research pathways and
analytical decision-making tools across various spatiotemporal domains. Despite
many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial
information remains a challenge. The space-time cube (STC) stands out as a
promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal
information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal
datasets. However, the STC is plagued by well-known issues such as visual
occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with
large-scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel
technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal
phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely
distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data.
Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to
visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to
mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by
enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the
exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal
perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a
real-world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve
non-experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its
superiority and effectiveness in largescale spatial time series analysis.

Method: 系统采用多模态机器学习管道生成多样化的叙事路径，用户可在检测到的分支点灵活选择，并通过沉浸式音频引导参与每个故事线。

Result: 评估显示，Branch Explorer显著提升了12名盲人和低视力用户的参与感和自主性，并帮助他们形成了个性化的探索策略。

Conclusion: 该系统为视频和虚拟环境的无障碍探索提供了重要启示。

Abstract: 360{\deg} videos enable users to freely choose their viewing paths, but blind
and low vision (BLV) users are often excluded from this interactive experience.
To bridge this gap, we present Branch Explorer, a system that transforms
360{\deg} videos into branching narratives -- stories that dynamically unfold
based on viewer choices -- to support interactive viewing for BLV audiences.
Our formative study identified three key considerations for accessible
branching narratives: providing diverse branch options, ensuring coherent story
progression, and enabling immersive navigation among branches. To address these
needs, Branch Explorer employs a multi-modal machine learning pipeline to
generate diverse narrative paths, allowing users to flexibly make choices at
detected branching points and seamlessly engage with each storyline through
immersive audio guidance. Evaluation with 12 BLV viewers showed that Branch
Explorer significantly enhanced user agency and engagement in 360{\deg} video
viewing. Users also developed personalized strategies for exploring 360{\deg}
content. We further highlight implications for supporting accessible
exploration of videos and virtual environments.

Conclusion: XROps通过降低技术门槛，使领域专家能够更轻松地创建和适应沉浸式分析应用。

Abstract: Immersive analytics is gaining attention across multiple domains due to its
capability to facilitate intuitive data analysis in expansive environments
through user interaction with data. However, creating immersive analytics
systems for specific tasks is challenging due to the need for programming
expertise and significant development effort. Despite the introduction of
various immersive visualization authoring toolkits, domain experts still face
hurdles in adopting immersive analytics into their workflow, particularly when
faced with dynamically changing tasks and data in real time. To lower such
technical barriers, we introduce XROps, a web-based authoring system that
allows users to create immersive analytics applications through interactive
visual programming, without the need for low-level scripting or coding. XROps
enables dynamic immersive analytics authoring by allowing users to modify each
step of the data visualization process with immediate feedback, enabling them
to build visualizations on-the-fly and adapt to changing environments. It also
supports the integration and visualization of real-time sensor data from XR
devices, a key feature of immersive analytics, facilitating the creation of
various analysis scenarios. We evaluated the usability of XROps through a user
study and demonstrate its efficacy and usefulness in several example scenarios.
We have released a web platform (https://vience.io/xrops) to demonstrate
various examples to supplement our findings.

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，MEDebiaser有效减少偏差，提升可用性和协作效率。

Conclusion: MEDebiaser为医学专业知识与AI驱动的医疗结合提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Medical images often contain multiple labels with imbalanced distributions
and co-occurrence, leading to bias in multi-label medical image classification.
Close collaboration between medical professionals and machine learning
practitioners has significantly advanced medical image analysis. However,
traditional collaboration modes struggle to facilitate effective feedback
between physicians and AI models, as integrating medical expertise into the
training process via engineers can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MEDebiaser, an interactive system enabling
physicians to directly refine AI models using local explanations. By combining
prediction with attention loss functions and employing a customized ranking
strategy to alleviate scalability, MEDebiaser allows physicians to mitigate
biases without technical expertise, reducing reliance on engineers, and thus
enhancing more direct human-AI feedback. Our mechanism and user studies
demonstrate that it effectively reduces biases, improves usability, and
enhances collaboration efficiency, providing a practical solution for
integrating medical expertise into AI-driven healthcare.

Conclusion: 设计文化适应和认知友好的技术可支持老年痴呆症患者的数字参与，提升其生活质量。

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Older adults with early-stage dementia often retain procedural
memory, enabling continued use of familiar technologies. Additionally, symbolic
anchors such as photos or personalized content may serve as memory cues to
reinforce digital engagement. This study explores how these mechanisms support
technology use in dementia care within the South Korean context.
  METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 11 professional caregivers of
community-dwelling older adults with cognitive decline. Grounded theory methods
guided the analysis, using iterative coding and constant comparison to identify
emergent themes.

Abstract: Our society increasingly depends on intelligent systems to solve complex
problems, ranging from recommender systems suggesting the next movie to watch
to AI models assisting in medical diagnoses for hospitalized patients. With the
iterative improvement of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, AI holds
significant potential to mitigate medical misdiagnoses by preventing numerous
deaths and reducing an economic burden of approximately 450 EUR billion
annually. However, a key obstacle to AI adoption lies in the lack of
transparency: many automated systems function as "black boxes," providing
predictions without revealing the underlying processes. This opacity can hinder
experts' ability to trust and rely on AI systems. Visual analytics (VA)
provides a compelling solution by combining AI models with interactive
visualizations. These specialized charts and graphs empower users to
incorporate their domain expertise to refine and improve the models, bridging
the gap between AI and human understanding. In this work, we define,
categorize, and explore how VA solutions can foster trust across the stages of
a typical AI pipeline. We propose a design space for innovative visualizations
and present an overview of our previously developed VA dashboards, which
support critical tasks within the various pipeline stages, including data
processing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, understanding,
debugging, refining, and comparing models.

Abstract: Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR) has shown promise in supporting emotion
regulation for neurodivergent children. Recently, there has been increasing
interest in leveraging advanced technologies to assist parents in co-regulating
emotions with their children. However, limited research has explored the
integration of large language models (LLMs) with SAR to facilitate emotion
co-regulation between parents and children with neurodevelopmental disorders.
To address this gap, we developed an LLM-powered social robot by deploying a
speech communication module on the MiRo-E robotic platform. This supervised
autonomous system integrates LLM prompts and robotic behaviors to deliver
tailored interventions for both parents and neurodivergent children. Pilot
tests were conducted with two parent-child dyads, followed by a qualitative
analysis. The findings reveal MiRo-E's positive impacts on interaction dynamics
and its potential to facilitate emotion regulation, along with identified
design and technical challenges. Based on these insights, we provide design
implications to advance the future development of LLM-powered SAR for mental
health applications.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能提升NPC真实感，但需优化系统性能和情感深度以实现更沉浸的VR体验。

Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly enhanced the
realism and interactivity of non-player characters (NPCs) in virtual reality
(VR), creating more engaging and believable user experiences. This paper
evaluates AI-driven NPCs within a VR interrogation simulator, focusing on their
perceived realism, usability, and system performance. The simulator features
two AI-powered NPCs, a suspect, and a partner, using GPT-4 Turbo to engage
participants in a scenario to determine the suspect's guilt or innocence. A
user study with 18 participants assessed the system using the System Usability
Scale (SUS), Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), and a Virtual Agent
Believability Questionnaire, alongside latency measurements for speech-to-text
(STT), text-to-speech (TTS), OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, and overall (cycle) latency.
Results showed an average cycle latency of 7 seconds, influenced by the
increasing conversational context. Believability scored 6.67 out of 10, with
high ratings in behavior, social relationships, and intelligence but moderate
scores in emotion and personality. The system achieved a SUS score of 79.44,
indicating good usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of large
language models to improve NPC realism and interaction in VR while highlighting
challenges in reducing system latency and enhancing emotional depth. This

Motivation: 现有视觉障碍模拟器未直接涉及视觉障碍者或从其视角评估，因此开发VIP-Sim以填补这一空白。

Method: 通过参与式设计过程，与7名视觉障碍者合作开发VIP-Sim，模拟21种症状（如视野缺失或光敏感）。

Result: 多数参与者认为VIP-Sim能复现其症状，但对其代表性和设计中的包容性仍有担忧。

Conclusion: VIP-Sim虽受好评，但需进一步验证其普适性和包容性。

Abstract: People with vision impairments (VIPs) often rely on their remaining vision
when interacting with user interfaces. Simulating visual impairments is an
effective tool for designers, fostering awareness of the challenges faced by
VIPs. While previous research has introduced various vision impairment
simulators, none have yet been developed with the direct involvement of VIPs or
thoroughly evaluated from their perspective. To address this gap, we developed
VIP-Sim. This symptom-based vision simulator was created through a
participatory design process tailored explicitly for this purpose, involving
N=7 VIPs. 21 symptoms, like field loss or light sensitivity, can be overlaid on
desktop design tools. Most participants felt VIP-Sim could replicate their
symptoms. VIP-Sim was received positively, but concerns about exclusion in
design and comprehensiveness of the simulation remain, mainly whether it
represents the experiences of other VIPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非结构化户外环境中，理解开放世界语义对机器人规划和控制至关重要，但现有方法因语义模糊和边界不清而表现不佳。

Method: OTAS通过聚类单视图和多视图中的语义相似结构，并将其与语言对齐，构建几何一致的特征场，支持开放词汇分割查询。

Result: OTAS在零样本条件下运行，无需场景微调，速度达17 fps，在多个数据集上优于现有2D和3D分割方法。

Conclusion: OTAS适用于机器人应用，代码和ROS节点将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Understanding open-world semantics is critical for robotic planning and
control, particularly in unstructured outdoor environments. Current
vision-language mapping approaches rely on object-centric segmentation priors,
which often fail outdoors due to semantic ambiguities and indistinct semantic
class boundaries. We propose OTAS - an Open-vocabulary Token Alignment method
for Outdoor Segmentation. OTAS overcomes the limitations of open-vocabulary
segmentation models by extracting semantic structure directly from the output
tokens of pretrained vision models. By clustering semantically similar
structures across single and multiple views and grounding them in language,
OTAS reconstructs a geometrically consistent feature field that supports
open-vocabulary segmentation queries. Our method operates zero-shot, without
scene-specific fine-tuning, and runs at up to ~17 fps. OTAS provides a minor
IoU improvement over fine-tuned and open-vocabulary 2D segmentation methods on
the Off-Road Freespace Detection dataset. Our model achieves up to a 151% IoU
improvement over open-vocabulary mapping methods in 3D segmentation on
TartanAir. Real-world reconstructions demonstrate OTAS' applicability to
robotic applications. The code and ROS node will be made publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: How to enable robots to predict the outcomes of their own motion intentions
in three-dimensional space has been a fundamental problem in embodied

pairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone
actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent
annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase

Abstract: High-precision vectorized maps are indispensable for autonomous driving, yet
traditional LiDAR-based creation is costly and slow, while single-vehicle
perception methods lack accuracy and robustness, particularly in adverse
conditions. This paper introduces EGC-VMAP, an end-to-end framework that
overcomes these limitations by generating accurate, city-scale vectorized maps
through the aggregation of data from crowdsourced vehicles. Unlike prior
approaches, EGC-VMAP directly fuses multi-vehicle, multi-temporal map elements
perceived onboard vehicles using a novel Trip-Aware Transformer architecture
within a unified learning process. Combined with hierarchical matching for
efficient training and a multi-objective loss, our method significantly
enhances map accuracy and structural robustness compared to single-vehicle
baselines. Validated on a large-scale, multi-city real-world dataset, EGC-VMAP
demonstrates superior performance, enabling a scalable, cost-effective solution
for city-wide mapping with a reported 90\% reduction in manual annotation
costs.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses
significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to
occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR
fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs).
Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the
systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes
precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from
roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections
annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings,
and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of
cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed
fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific
feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera
high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative
evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach
consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal
baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the
mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the
image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study
establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and
provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted
autonomous driving systems.

Result: 提出了一种高效的强化学习框架，显著提升了多指操作的灵巧性。

Conclusion: 通过直接解决计算感觉运动学习的根本限制，论文为机器人灵巧操作提供了有效的方法。

Abstract: Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with
multi-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and
emergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox,
dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many
million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich
tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long
been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward
general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor
learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary
in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels
of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational
sensorimotor learning.
  I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause.
Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an
effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively
overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The
insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that
incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this
thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for
dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.

*Ziyan Gao,Lijun Wang,Yuntao Kong,Nak Young Chong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合装箱策略、结构稳定性验证和启发式规划的新框架，解决了在线装箱问题中的稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法虽能提高容积利用率，但无法确保装箱的结构稳定性，且缺乏安全重构机制。

Method: 引入负载可承受凸多边形（LBCP）进行稳定性验证，并提出稳定重排规划（SRP）模块以安全重构装箱。

Result: 实验表明LBCP验证高效且通用，SRP在节省重排成本方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际工业与物流应用提供了鲁棒的自动化装箱解决方案。

Abstract: The Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) is a sequential decision-making task in
which each item must be placed immediately upon arrival, with no knowledge of
future arrivals. Although recent deep-reinforcement-learning methods achieve
superior volume utilization compared with classical heuristics, the learned
policies cannot ensure the structural stability of the bin and lack mechanisms
for safely reconfiguring the bin when a new item cannot be placed directly. In
this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates packing policy with
structural stability validation and heuristic planning to overcome these
limitations. Specifically, we introduce the concept of Load Bearable Convex
Polygon (LBCP), which provides a computationally efficient way to identify
stable loading positions that guarantee no bin collapse. Additionally, we
present Stable Rearrangement Planning (SRP), a module that rearranges existing
items to accommodate new ones while maintaining overall stability. Extensive
experiments on standard OBPP benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and
generalizability of our LBCP-based stability validation, as well as the
superiority of SRP in finding the effort-saving rearrangement plans. Our method
offers a robust and practical solution for automated packing in real-world
industrial and logistics applications.

Conclusion: VLA模型的先验知识已包含物理交互的语义理解，通过少量演示激活触觉传感器，可实现零样本泛化。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable achievements,
driven by the rich implicit knowledge of their vision-language components.
However, achieving generalist robotic agents demands precise grounding into
physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained
force control is essential. We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond
identifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real
world. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses
vision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a
hybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into
precise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt
its strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's
effectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling
tactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant
commonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key
finding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic
understanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile
sensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to
achieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人任务训练提供了高效、可扩展的工具，适用于现有框架或数据集存储。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for the procedural construction of multi-step
contact-rich manipulation tasks in robotics. Our generator takes as input
user-defined sets of atomic actions, objects, and spatial predicates and
outputs solvable tasks of a given length for the selected robotic environment.
The generator produces solvable tasks by constraining all possible
(nonsolvable) combinations by symbolic and physical validation. The symbolic
validation checks each generated sequence for logical and operational
consistency, and also the suitability of object-predicate relations. Physical
validation checks whether tasks can be solved in the selected robotic
environment. Only the tasks that passed both validators are retained. The
output from the generator can be directly interfaced with any existing
framework for training robotic manipulation tasks, or it can be stored as a
dataset of curated robotic tasks with detailed information about each task.
This is beneficial for RL training as there are dense reward functions and
initial and goal states paired with each subgoal. It allows the user to measure
the semantic similarity of all generated tasks. We tested our generator on
sequences of up to 15 actions resulting in millions of unique solvable
multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法无需基础设施或人工调参，开源且优于现有技术，适用于非重叠配置。

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving
the foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction
systems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework
for multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or
precise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods
that require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach
introduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle
adjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed
method constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning
from the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while
formulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This
method effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves
outlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism.
Extensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world
scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration
techniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for
non-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average
translational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2{\deg}, with an
initial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30{\deg}. Moreover, the calibration
process operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning.

Abstract: Optimal path planning in nonconvex free spaces is notoriously challenging, as
formulating such problems as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) is NP-hard.
We propose HZ-MP, an informed Hybrid Zonotope-based Motion Planner, as an
alternative approach that decomposes the obstacle-free space and performs
low-dimensional face sampling guided by an ellipsotope heuristic, enabling
focused exploration along promising transit regions. This structured
exploration eliminates the excessive, unreachable sampling that degrades
existing informed planners such as AIT* and EIT* in narrow gaps or boxed-goal
scenarios. We prove that HZ-MP is probabilistically complete and asymptotically
optimal. It converges to near-optimal trajectories in finite time and scales to
high-dimensional cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning,
faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy
computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and
traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of
perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random
Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight
linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space,
followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel
Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this
process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this
map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner)
framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance
Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to
refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a
closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP
model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive
navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form
gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in
diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in
time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe
navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster
community collaboration.

Motivation: 卫星定位和摄像头在许多环境中可用性有限，导致依赖惯性传感器的定位精度随时间迅速下降，需要一种新的信息辅助方法来减少漂移。

Method: 引入控制零速度更新（C-ZUPT）方法，通过不确定性阈值识别准静态平衡，为估计滤波器提供精确速度更新。

Result: 实验验证表明，C-ZUPT显著减少惯性漂移和控制能耗，增强导航稳定性，延长飞行时间。

Conclusion: C-ZUPT方法有效减少滤波器发散，提升导航稳定性，特别适用于资源受限的空中系统。

Abstract: Autonomous systems across diverse domains have underscored the need for
drift-resilient state estimation. Although satellite-based positioning and
cameras are widely used, they often suffer from limited availability in many
environments. As a result, positioning must rely solely on inertial sensors,
leading to rapid accuracy degradation over time due to sensor biases and noise.
To counteract this, alternative update sources-referred to as information
aiding-serve as anchors of certainty. Among these, the zero-velocity update
(ZUPT) is particularly effective in providing accurate corrections during
stationary intervals, though it is restricted to surface-bound platforms. This
work introduces a controlled ZUPT (C-ZUPT) approach for aerial navigation and
control, independent of surface contact. By defining an uncertainty threshold,
C-ZUPT identifies quasi-static equilibria to deliver precise velocity updates
to the estimation filter. Extensive validation confirms that these
opportunistic, high-quality updates significantly reduce inertial drift and
control effort. As a result, C-ZUPT mitigates filter divergence and enhances
navigation stability, enabling more energy-efficient hovering and substantially
extending sustained flight-key advantages for resource-constrained aerial
systems.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration has proven effective in robotics for acquiring
natural behaviors, such as stylistic motions and lifelike agility, particularly
when explicitly defining style-oriented reward functions is challenging.
Synthesizing stylistic motions for real-world tasks usually requires balancing
task performance and imitation quality. Existing methods generally depend on
expert demonstrations closely aligned with task objectives. However, practical
demonstrations are often incomplete or unrealistic, causing current methods to
boost style at the expense of task performance. To address this issue, we
propose formulating the problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP). Specifically, we optimize a style-imitation objective with constraints
to maintain near-optimal task performance. We introduce an adaptively
adjustable Lagrangian multiplier to guide the agent to imitate demonstrations
selectively, capturing stylistic nuances without compromising task performance.
We validate our approach across multiple robotic platforms and tasks,
demonstrating both robust task performance and high-fidelity style learning. On
ANYmal-D hardware we show a 14.5% drop in mechanical energy and a more agile
gait pattern, showcasing real-world benefits.

Result: 在多个城市的真实交通场景中，MRMEL实现了4%-9%的车辆排放减少，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MRMEL为复杂多变的交通环境提供了一种有效的拉格朗日控制解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their
applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as
mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts
with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is
referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective
Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic
scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are
highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such
diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint
complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among
participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict
physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce
Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for
Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with
a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic
scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement
learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a
residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable
nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic
scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case
study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas
Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios.
The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving
an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the
strongest baseline in each setting.

framework employs classifier-free guidance training and integrates local

scenarios, the system generates initial trajectories using the diffusion model
and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation,
demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial

Abstract: Visual coverage path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires
agents to strategically coordinate UAV motion and camera control to maximize
coverage, minimize redundancy, and maintain battery efficiency. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on environment-specific reward
formulations that lack semantic adaptability. This study proposes
Prompt-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL), a novel approach that integrates
the zero-shot reasoning ability and in-context learning capability of large
language models with curiosity-driven RL. PIRL leverages semantic feedback from
an LLM, GPT-3.5, to dynamically shape the reward function of the Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) RL policy guiding the agent in position and camera
adjustments for optimal visual coverage. The PIRL agent is trained using OpenAI
Gym and evaluated in various environments. Furthermore, the sim-to-real-like
ability and zero-shot generalization of the agent are tested by operating the
agent in Webots simulator which introduces realistic physical dynamics. Results
show that PIRL outperforms multiple learning-based baselines such as PPO with
static rewards, PPO with exploratory weight initialization, imitation learning,
and an LLM-only controller. Across different environments, PIRL outperforms the
best-performing baseline by achieving up to 14% higher visual coverage in
OpenAI Gym and 27% higher in Webots, up to 25% higher battery efficiency, and
up to 18\% lower redundancy, depending on the environment. The results
highlight the effectiveness of LLM-guided reward shaping in complex spatial
exploration tasks and suggest a promising direction for integrating natural
language priors into RL for robotics.

Abstract: Flying multiple quadrotors in close proximity presents a significant
challenge due to complex aerodynamic interactions, particularly downwash
effects that are known to destabilize vehicles and degrade performance.
Traditionally, multi-quadrotor systems rely on conservative strategies, such as
collision avoidance zones around the robot volume, to circumvent this effect.
This restricts their capabilities by requiring a large volume for the operation
of a multi-quadrotor system, limiting their applicability in dense
environments. This work provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the
downwash effect, with a focus on characterizing, analyzing, and understanding
forces, moments, and velocities in both single and multi-quadrotor
configurations. We use measurements of forces and torques to characterize
vehicle interactions, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) to quantify the
spatial features of the downwash wake for a single quadrotor and an interacting
pair of quadrotors. This data can be used to inform physics-based strategies
for coordination, leverage downwash for optimized formations, expand the
envelope of operation, and improve the robustness of multi-quadrotor control.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have emerged as versatile platforms, driving
the demand for accurate modeling to support developmental testing. This paper
proposes data-driven modeling software for UAV. Emphasizes the utilization of
cost-effective sensors to obtain orientation and location data subsequently
processed through the application of data filtering algorithms and sensor
fusion techniques to improve the data quality to make a precise model
visualization on the software. UAV's orientation is obtained using processed
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and represented using Quaternion
Representation to avoid the gimbal lock problem. The UAV's location is
determined by combining data from the Global Positioning System (GPS), which
provides stable geographic coordinates but slower data update frequency, and
the accelerometer, which has higher data update frequency but integrating it to
get position data is unstable due to its accumulative error. By combining data
from these two sensors, the software is able to calculate and continuously
update the UAV's real-time position during its flight operations. The result
shows that the software effectively renders UAV orientation and position with
high degree of accuracy and fluidity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧相机采样频率低于毫米波雷达，限制了系统吞吐量，需改进以实现更高效的无人机定位与降落。

Method: 引入事件相机与毫米波雷达协同工作，提出一致性协作跟踪模块和图自适应联合优化模块，充分利用时空信息。

Result: 实验表明，mmE-Loc在精度和延迟上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: mmE-Loc为无人机精准降落提供了高效解决方案，结合事件相机与毫米波雷达的优势。

Abstract: For precise, efficient, and safe drone landings, ground platforms should
real-time, accurately locate descending drones and guide them to designated
spots. While mmWave sensing combined with cameras improves localization
accuracy, lower sampling frequency of traditional frame cameras compared to
mmWave radar creates bottlenecks in system throughput. In this work, we upgrade
traditional frame camera with event camera, a novel sensor that harmonizes in
sampling frequency with mmWave radar within ground platform setup, and
introduce mmE-Loc, a high-precision, low-latency ground localization system
designed for precise drone landings. To fully exploit the \textit{temporal
consistency} and \textit{spatial complementarity} between these two modalities,
we propose two innovative modules: \textit{(i)} the Consistency-instructed
Collaborative Tracking module, which further leverages the drone's physical
knowledge of periodic micro-motions and structure for accurate measurements
extraction, and \textit{(ii)} the Graph-informed Adaptive Joint Optimization
module, which integrates drone motion information for efficient sensor fusion
and drone localization. Real-world experiments conducted in landing scenarios
with a drone delivery company demonstrate that mmE-Loc significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and latency.

Result: 数据集为开发协作感知系统提供了基础，提升了遮挡处理能力，并加速了多智能体卡车自动驾驶系统的部署。

Conclusion: TruckV2X填补了重型车辆协作感知数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: Autonomous trucking offers significant benefits, such as improved safety and
reduced costs, but faces unique perception challenges due to trucks' large size
and dynamic trailer movements. These challenges include extensive blind spots
and occlusions that hinder the truck's perception and the capabilities of other
road users. To address these limitations, cooperative perception emerges as a
promising solution. However, existing datasets predominantly feature light
vehicle interactions or lack multi-agent configurations for heavy-duty vehicle
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruckV2X, the first large-scale
truck-centered cooperative perception dataset featuring multi-modal sensing
(LiDAR and cameras) and multi-agent cooperation (tractors, trailers, CAVs, and
RSUs). We further investigate how trucks influence collaborative perception
needs, establishing performance benchmarks while suggesting research priorities
for heavy vehicle perception. The dataset provides a foundation for developing
cooperative perception systems with enhanced occlusion handling capabilities,
and accelerates the deployment of multi-agent autonomous trucking systems. The
TruckV2X dataset is available at

Conclusion: Plan-MAE可作为基于学习的运动规划器的重要预训练步骤，提升自动驾驶的轨迹规划能力。

Abstract: Predicting the future of surrounding agents and accordingly planning a safe,
goal-directed trajectory are crucial for automated vehicles. Current methods
typically rely on imitation learning to optimize metrics against the ground
truth, often overlooking how scene understanding could enable more holistic
trajectories. In this paper, we propose Plan-MAE, a unified pretraining
framework for prediction and planning that capitalizes on masked autoencoders.
Plan-MAE fuses critical contextual understanding via three dedicated tasks:
reconstructing masked road networks to learn spatial correlations, agent
trajectories to model social interactions, and navigation routes to capture
destination intents. To further align vehicle dynamics and safety constraints,
we incorporate a local sub-planning task predicting the ego-vehicle's near-term
trajectory segment conditioned on earlier segment. This pretrained model is
subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks to jointly generate the prediction
and planning trajectories. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that
Plan-MAE outperforms current methods on the planning metrics by a large margin
and can serve as an important pre-training step for learning-based motion
planner.

Conclusion: 论文首次聚焦SNN处理LIDAR数据时膜泄漏的重要性，并开源了LIDAR数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much
attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) for high-precision yet low memory and compute complexity
inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs
well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers)
where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context,
this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and
obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a
LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together
with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance.
Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first
focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN
precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that
by carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to
achieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during
this work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future
research.

Conclusion: IteraOptiRacing策略在竞速场景中表现优异，适用于实时操作，提升了赛车的操控性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified planning-control strategy for competing with
other racing cars called IteraOptiRacing in autonomous racing environments.
This unified strategy is proposed based on Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator
for Iterative Tasks (i2LQR), which can improve lap time performance in the
presence of surrounding racing obstacles. By iteratively using the ego car's
historical data, both obstacle avoidance for multiple moving cars and time cost
optimization are considered in this unified strategy, resulting in
collision-free and time-optimal generated trajectories. The algorithm's
constant low computation burden and suitability for parallel computing enable
real-time operation in competitive racing scenarios. To validate its
performance, simulations in a high-fidelity simulator are conducted with
multiple randomly generated dynamic agents on the track. Results show that the
proposed strategy outperforms existing methods across all randomly generated
autonomous racing scenarios, enabling enhanced maneuvering for the ego racing
car.

Motivation: 受蚂蚁在极简感官输入和少量学习行走下实现稳健视觉归巢的启发，研究旨在开发一种资源高效的自主导航解决方案。

Method: 通过侧向MB架构，利用角路径积分（PI）信号对全景视图进行分类，分为“目标在左”和“目标在右”记忆库，并在真实环境中进行四组实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在自然户外环境中实现了稳健的归巢行为，包括精确的目标停止行为，且系统资源占用极低。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种基于生物学的、资源高效的视觉归巢解决方案，为自主导航领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few
learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While
Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have
not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world
implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a
compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path
integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during
learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the
right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We
validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation
showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled
learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks
using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal
behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to
control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and
functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite
relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with
32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a
biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual
homing.

for mobile manipulators, virtual reality frameworks, and large language models
to reduce operators' complexity and cognitive load in some challenging and
uncertain scenarios.

Result: 在MetaDrive仿真环境中验证，框架成功处理复杂交通场景，且对不同交通代理行为模型表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架在不确定性下表现出色，适用于现实世界的自主导航挑战。

Abstract: Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason
about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we
introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal
predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We
develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction
uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a
Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a
closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical
tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing
mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of
behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal
uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation
scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that
our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios
with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust
performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad
applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges. Code and videos

Result: 实验验证了AdvGrasp的有效性，实际应用中也表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdvGrasp为机器人抓取的鲁棒性评估和改进提供了新视角。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on robotic grasping provide valuable insights into
evaluating and improving the robustness of these systems. Unlike studies that
focus solely on neural network predictions while overlooking the physical
principles of grasping, this paper introduces AdvGrasp, a framework for
adversarial attacks on robotic grasping from a physical perspective.
Specifically, AdvGrasp targets two core aspects: lift capability, which
evaluates the ability to lift objects against gravity, and grasp stability,
which assesses resistance to external disturbances. By deforming the object's
shape to increase gravitational torque and reduce stability margin in the
wrench space, our method systematically degrades these two key grasping
metrics, generating adversarial objects that compromise grasp performance.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the effectiveness of
AdvGrasp, while real-world validations demonstrate its robustness and practical
applicability

Result: 方法在复杂场景中有效，可定制导航势场的同伦特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人导航提供了灵活且安全的路径规划解决方案。

Abstract: Safe navigation within a workspace is a fundamental skill for autonomous
robots to accomplish more complex tasks. Harmonic potentials are artificial
potential fields that are analytical, globally convergent and provably free of
local minima. Thus, it has been widely used for generating safe and reliable
robot navigation control policies. However, most existing methods do not allow
customization of the harmonic potential fields nor the resulting paths,
particularly regarding their topological properties. In this paper, we propose
a novel method that automatically finds homotopy classes of paths that can be
generated by valid harmonic potential fields. The considered complex workspaces
can be as general as forest worlds consisting of numerous overlapping
star-obstacles. The method is based on a hybrid optimization algorithm that
searches over homotopy classes, selects the structure of each tree-of-stars
within the forest, and optimizes over the continuous weight parameters for each
purged tree via the projected gradient descent. The key insight is to transform
the forest world to the unbounded point world via proper diffeomorphic
transformations. It not only facilitates a simpler design of the
multi-directional D-signature between non-homotopic paths, but also retain the
safety and convergence properties. Extensive simulations and hardware
experiments are conducted for non-trivial scenarios, where the navigation
potentials are customized for desired homotopic properties. Project page:

Result: 在导航和操作任务中，GUIDER的稳定性显著优于基线方法（导航提升39.5%，操作提升31.4%）。

Conclusion: GUIDER的双阶段框架在移动操作任务中显著提升了意图推断的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate inference of human intent enables human-robot collaboration without
constraining human control or causing conflicts between humans and robots. We
present GUIDER (Global User Intent Dual-phase Estimation for Robots), a
probabilistic framework that enables a robot to estimate the intent of human
operators. GUIDER maintains two coupled belief layers, one tracking navigation
goals and the other manipulation goals. In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map
blends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas.
Upon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud.
The Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and
three geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware
update rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can
recognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated
GUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and
compared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation.
Across the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during
navigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of
39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5). During manipulation, stability reached
94-100% (versus 69-100% for Trajectron), with a 31.4% difference in a
redirection task (T3). In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER
recognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median
remaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate
our dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both
phases of mobile manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Touch is recognized as a vital sense for humans and an equally important
modality for robots, especially for dexterous manipulation, material
identification, and scenarios involving visual occlusion. Building upon very
recent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature
Octopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its
predecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from
multiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
module to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects
on-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld
tactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile
sensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with
Octopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will
showcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile
inputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5
will identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how
to handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also
plan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items.
With live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress
and limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in
this exciting field. Code for Octopi-1.5 and design files for the TMI gripper

Conclusion: SC-ADAS证明了结合对话推理、场景感知和模块化控制的可行性，为下一代智能驾驶辅助提供了方向。

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret
scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems
typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based
interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to
driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a
modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large
language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling
to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS
supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing
natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented
in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes
confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model
fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and
revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased
latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated
dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining
conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support
the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for

Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) using a surrogate reward function designed to
approximate complex specific scoring metrics. We subsequently refine this
learned policy through a zero-order optimization step employing the Separable
Natural Evolution Strategy (SNES), directly targeting the original score.
Experimental evaluations conducted in the context of the 2nd AI Olympics with
RealAIGym at IROS 2024 demonstrate that our evolutionary fine-tuning
significantly improves agent performance while maintaining high robustness. The
resulting controllers outperform established baselines, achieving competitive
scores for the competition tasks.

*Jie Pan,Tianyi Wang,Yangyang Wang,Junfeng Jiao,Christian Claudel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种信任感知的博弈论换道决策框架（TGLD），通过动态评估人类驾驶车辆的信任水平，优化自动驾驶车辆的换道策略，提高效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶车辆（AVs）在异构交通环境中与人类驾驶车辆（HVs）协作时，现有换道框架忽视HVs动态信任水平的问题。

Method: 1. 构建多车辆联盟博弈模型，结合AVs的全合作行为和HVs的部分合作行为；2. 开发在线信任评估方法，动态估计HVs的信任水平；3. 考虑社会兼容性目标，最小化对周围车辆的干扰。

Result: 实验验证表明，TGLD框架能根据HVs的信任水平和驾驶风格调整策略，显著提高换道效率、安全性及交互透明度。

Conclusion: TGLD框架通过信任机制实现了AVs与HVs的高效、安全和适应性交互，为异构交通环境提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible
behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in
heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing
frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to
accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study
proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework.
First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully
cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs
informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust
evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during
lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate
cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered
by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the
predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and
context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment
conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.
Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different
HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism
significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and
contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.

Result: 实验表明，MP-RBFN在生成优化运动基元时精度比现有半解析方法高7倍，且推理时间短。

Conclusion: MP-RBFN在运动规划中表现出色，已开源并集成到采样轨迹规划器中，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This research introduces MP-RBFN, a novel formulation leveraging Radial Basis
Function Networks for efficiently learning Motion Primitives derived from
optimal control problems for autonomous driving. While traditional motion
planning approaches based on optimization are highly accurate, they are often
computationally prohibitive. In contrast, sampling-based methods demonstrate
high performance but impose constraints on the geometric shape of trajectories.
MP-RBFN combines the strengths of both by coupling the high-fidelity trajectory
generation of sampling-based methods with an accurate description of vehicle
dynamics. Empirical results show compelling performance compared to previous
methods, achieving a precise description of motion primitives at low inference
times. MP-RBFN yields a seven times higher accuracy in generating optimized
motion primitives compared to existing semi-analytic approaches. We demonstrate
the practical applicability of MP-RBFN for motion planning by integrating the
method into a sampling-based trajectory planner. MP-RBFN is available as
open-source software at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/RBFN-Motion-Primitives.

collaborative robots naturally and efficiently. This model recognizes eight
distinct hand gestures with only 1,103 parameters and a compact size of 22 KB,
achieving an accuracy of 93.5%. To further optimize the model for real-world
deployment on edge devices, we applied quantization and pruning using
TensorFlow Lite, reducing the final model size to just 7 KB. The system was
successfully implemented and tested on a Universal Robot UR5 collaborative

TL;DR: REACT框架通过实时几何模型和路径规划，解决了水下机器人因缆绳缠绕导致的任务受限问题，实现了高效、安全的全覆盖检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水下机器人检测复杂结构时，缆绳缠绕风险限制了任务效率和安全性。

Conclusion: REACT显著提升了水下机器人检测的安全性和效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Inspection of complex underwater structures with tethered underwater vehicles
is often hindered by the risk of tether entanglement. We propose REACT
(real-time entanglement-aware coverage path planning for tethered underwater
vehicles), a framework designed to overcome this limitation. REACT comprises a
fast geometry-based tether model using the signed distance field (SDF) map for
accurate, real-time simulation of taut tether configurations around arbitrary
structures in 3D. This model enables an efficient online replanning strategy by
enforcing a maximum tether length constraint, thereby actively preventing
entanglement. By integrating REACT into a coverage path planning framework, we
achieve safe and optimal inspection paths, previously challenging due to tether
constraints. The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe
inspection scenario, demonstrating safe, entanglement-free navigation and
full-coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete
coverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission
20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to
proactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission
disentanglement. Real-world experiments confirm these benefits, where REACT
completes the full mission, while the baseline planner fails due to physical
tether entanglement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将离散的占用网格地图转化为连续可微函数的方法，以解决MPC中障碍物避障约束的兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MPC在导航任务中因离散占用网格地图与连续可微约束不兼容而难以实现障碍物避障的问题。

Method: 通过将障碍物定义为多边形（半空间的交集），并使用模糊逻辑将逻辑运算符重新表述为不等式约束，使其与标准MPC兼容。

Result: 在仿真中成功测试了基于MPC的轨迹规划器。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于导航任务，还可用于在MPC中实现逻辑或语言约束。

Abstract: In practice, navigation of mobile robots in confined environments is often
done using a spatially discrete cost-map to represent obstacles. Path following
is a typical use case for model predictive control (MPC), but formulating
constraints for obstacle avoidance is challenging in this case. Typically the
cost and constraints of an MPC problem are defined as closed-form functions and
typical solvers work best with continuously differentiable functions. This is
contrary to spatially discrete occupancy grid maps, in which a grid's value
defines the cost associated with occupancy. This paper presents a way to
overcome this compatibility issue by re-formulating occupancy grid maps to
continuously differentiable functions to be embedded into the MPC scheme as
constraints. Each obstacle is defined as a polygon -- an intersection of
half-spaces. Any half-space is a linear inequality representing one edge of a
polygon. Using AND and OR operators, the combined set of all obstacles and
therefore the obstacle avoidance constraints can be described. The key
contribution of this paper is the use of fuzzy logic to re-formulate such
constraints that include logical operators as inequality constraints which are
compatible with standard MPC formulation. The resulting MPC-based trajectory
planner is successfully tested in simulation. This concept is also applicable
outside of navigation tasks to implement logical or verbal constraints in MPC.

Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is a nonlinear estimation algorithm commonly used

crucial to the stable behavior of the filter. This prediction is done by
propagating the sigma points according to the dynamic model at hand. In this

This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate

Abstract: The rapid emergence of foundation models, particularly Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), has introduced a transformative
paradigm in robotics. These models offer powerful capabilities in semantic
understanding, high-level reasoning, and cross-modal generalization, enabling
significant advances in perception, planning, control, and human-robot
interaction. This critical review provides a structured synthesis of recent
developments, categorizing applications across simulation-driven design,
open-world execution, sim-to-real transfer, and adaptable robotics. Unlike
existing surveys that emphasize isolated capabilities, this work highlights
integrated, system-level strategies and evaluates their practical feasibility
in real-world environments. Key enabling trends such as procedural scene
generation, policy generalization, and multimodal reasoning are discussed
alongside core bottlenecks, including limited embodiment, lack of multimodal
data, safety risks, and computational constraints. Through this lens, this
paper identifies both the architectural strengths and critical limitations of
foundation model-based robotics, highlighting open challenges in real-time
operation, grounding, resilience, and trust. The review concludes with a
roadmap for future research aimed at bridging semantic reasoning and physical
intelligence through more robust, interpretable, and embodied models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for whole-body torque control of
humanoid robots without joint torque sensors, designed for systems with
electric motors and high-ratio harmonic drives. The approach integrates
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for friction modeling and Unscented
Kalman Filtering (UKF) for joint torque estimation, within a real-time torque
control architecture. PINNs estimate nonlinear static and dynamic friction from
joint and motor velocity readings, capturing effects like motor actuation
without joint movement. The UKF utilizes PINN-based friction estimates as
direct measurement inputs, improving torque estimation robustness. Experimental
validation on the ergoCub humanoid robot demonstrates improved torque tracking
accuracy, enhanced energy efficiency, and superior disturbance rejection
compared to the state-of-the-art Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA), using
a dynamic balancing experiment. The framework's scalability is shown by
consistent performance across robots with similar hardware but different
friction characteristics, without re-identification. Furthermore, a comparative
analysis with position control highlights the advantages of the proposed torque
control approach. The results establish the method as a scalable and practical
solution for sensorless torque control in humanoid robots, ensuring torque

Abstract: Developing robust locomotion controllers for bipedal robots with closed
kinematic chains presents unique challenges, particularly since most
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simplify these parallel mechanisms into
serial models during training. We demonstrate that this simplification
significantly impairs sim-to-real transfer by failing to capture essential
aspects such as joint coupling, friction dynamics, and motor-space control
characteristics. In this work, we present an RL framework that explicitly
incorporates closed-chain dynamics and validate it on our custom-built robot
TopA. Our approach enhances policy robustness through symmetry-aware loss
functions, adversarial training, and targeted network regularization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our integrated approach achieves stable
locomotion across diverse terrains, significantly outperforming methods based
on simplified kinematic models.

Abstract: Optimization has been widely used to generate smooth trajectories for motion
planning. However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when
dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel
computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently
solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this
paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the
Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which
decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in
parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per
iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that
integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the
optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality
constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness.
Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving
over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on
modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and
show high performance with thousands of segments.

Conclusion: 雷达在恶劣天气下的鲁棒性使其成为姿态估计系统的关键组件，尤其在视觉传感器性能下降时。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems are highly dependent on sensors like cameras,
LiDAR, and inertial measurement units (IMU) to perceive the environment and
estimate their motion. Among these sensors, perception-based sensors are not
protected from harsh weather and technical failures. Although existing methods
show robustness against common technical issues like rotational misalignment
and disconnection, they often degrade when faced with dynamic environmental
factors like weather conditions. To address these problems, this research
introduces a novel deep learning-based motion estimator that integrates visual,
inertial, and millimeter-wave radar data, utilizing each sensor strengths to
improve odometry estimation accuracy and reliability under adverse
environmental conditions such as snow, rain, and varying light. The proposed
model uses advanced sensor fusion techniques that dynamically adjust the
contributions of each sensor based on the current environmental condition, with
radar compensating for visual sensor limitations in poor visibility. This work
explores recent advancements in radar-based odometry and highlights that radar
robustness in different weather conditions makes it a valuable component for
pose estimation systems, specifically when visual sensors are degraded.
Experimental results, conducted on the Boreas dataset, showcase the robustness
and effectiveness of the model in both clear and degraded environments.

Conclusion: MP1通过高效的单次评估和轻量级损失函数，显著提升了机器人动作轨迹生成的性能和速度。

Abstract: In robot manipulation, robot learning has become a prevailing approach.
However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off
between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural
constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit
consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs
3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action
trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning
the interval-averaged velocity via the MeanFlow Identity, our policy avoids any
additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical
ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1
further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while
retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because
subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in
few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state
embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference.
We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in
real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average
task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its
average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster
than FlowPolicy. Our code is available at https://mp1-2254.github.io/.

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了动态文本流的可视化，揭示了主题聚类，适用于实时数据流分析。

Abstract: We present a visualization infrastructure that maps data elements to agents,
which have behaviors parameterized by those elements. Dynamic visualizations
emerge as the agents change position, alter appearance and respond to one
other. Agents move to minimize the difference between displayed agent-to-agent
distances, and an input matrix of ideal distances. Our current application is
visualization of streaming text. Each agent represents a significant word,
visualizing it by displaying the word itself, centered in a circle sized by the
frequency of word occurrence. We derive the ideal distance matrix from word
cooccurrence, mapping higher co-occurrence to lower distance. To depict
co-occurrence in its textual context, the ratio of intersection to circle area
approximates the ratio of word co-occurrence to frequency. A networked backend
process gathers articles from news feeds, blogs, Digg or Twitter, exploiting
online search APIs to focus on user-chosen topics. Resulting visuals reveal the
primary topics in text streams as clusters, with agent-based layout moving
without instability as data streams change dynamically.

Result: 实验显示M1-Parallel在保持准确性的同时提速2.2倍，并提高任务完成率。

Conclusion: 并行计划执行优化了多代理系统在高复杂度任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated
remarkable promise for tackling complex tasks by breaking them down into
subtasks that are iteratively planned, executed, observed, and refined. Despite
their effectiveness, these systems often incur high latency because real-world
problems frequently demand multiple iterative cycles of reasoning steps. To
address this challenge, we propose M1-Parallel, a framework that concurrently
runs multiple multi-agent teams in parallel to uncover distinct solution paths.
By leveraging an event-driven communication model with asynchronous messaging,
M1-Parallel efficiently capitalizes on the inherent diversity of valid plans to
either reduce end-to-end latency or boost task completion rates. Our
experiments on complex tasks show that M1-Parallel with early termination
achieves up to $2.2\times$ speedup while preserving accuracy, and that
M1-Parallel with aggregation yields higher task completion rates. We further
investigate strategies aimed at encouraging diverse execution plans but observe
no additional performance gains over repeated sampling. Overall, these findings
underscore the potential of parallel plan execution for optimizing multi-agent
systems for real-world, high-complexity reasoning tasks.

often computationally expensive, both at training and inference time. In this
work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses these
challenges by training only a single leader LLM to coordinate a team of
untrained peer agents. To this end, we propose Multi-agent guided Leader Policy
\textbf{O}ptimization (MLPO), a novel approach which trains the leader to
evaluate and synthesize agent responses without auxiliary value networks or
explicit agent feedback. Leaders trained with MLPO exhibit improved performance
not only when interacting with the agent team at inference time, but also enjoy
improved performance when deployed in single-agent settings without the team.
Empirical results on Big-Bench Hard (BBH), MATH, and MMLU demonstrate that our
framework achieves substantial performance improvements over both single-agent
and multi-agent baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of training a single, flexible leader for collaborative reasoning in
multi-agent LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模拟工具存在局限性，如分离不同类型的道路使用者、依赖脚本行为、忽视公共交通用户，且缺乏对非技术用户的易用性设计。

Method: 采用高保真沉浸式虚拟环境，模块化架构，集成多种硬件设备和传感器（如fNIRS、眼动追踪等），支持多模态数据采集。

Result: 展示了三个用例，证明系统的可用性，旨在降低高保真交通模拟的门槛，支持跨学科实验。

Conclusion: 该平台为复杂城市环境中多模式交通研究提供了创新工具，提升了模拟的包容性和实用性。

Abstract: As cities evolve toward more complex and multimodal transportation systems,
the need for human-centered multi-agent simulation tools has never been more
urgent. Yet most existing platforms remain limited - they often separate
different types of road users, rely on scripted or pre-defined behaviors,
overlook public transit users as active participants, and are rarely designed
with accessibility in mind for non-technical users. To address this gap, this
paper presents the specifications of a multi-agent simulation platform designed
to support real-time, human-centered, and immersive studies of all road users,
accompanied by open-source scripts for replication. Using high-fidelity
immersive virtual environments, our platform enables interaction across public
transit users, pedestrians, cyclists, automated vehicles, and drivers. The
architecture is modular, extensible, and designed for accessibility. The system
integrates hardware-specific modules - including an omnidirectional treadmill,
a seating arrangement, a smart trainer, and an actuated cockpit. Additionally,
the platform collects multimodal physiological, neurological, and behavioral
data through embedded sensing devices such as functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and wrist-based biosensors. To show the
usability of this system, we present three use cases. Simulation for All aims
to lower the barrier to entry for high-fidelity transportation simulation,
support experimentation across disciplines, and advance our understanding of
multimodal mobility in complex urban environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种理性心智化模型，用于权衡社交学习与非社交学习的决策，并通过实验验证了模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类如何平衡社交学习与非社交学习，以优化学习效率。

Method: 提出理性心智化模型，通过推理他人目标和行为的信息量来评估社交学习的效用，并与非社交学习进行比较。

Result: 模型能定量捕捉人类在社交与非社交学习之间的权衡，且两者结合能更高效地实现目标。

Conclusion: 理性心智化模型为理解人类学习决策提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Social learning is a powerful mechanism through which agents learn about the
world from others. However, humans don't always choose to observe others, since
social learning can carry time and cognitive resource costs. How do people
balance social and non-social learning? In this paper, we propose a rational
mentalizing model of the decision to engage in social learning. This model
estimates the utility of social learning by reasoning about the other agent's
goal and the informativity of their future actions. It then weighs the utility
of social learning against the utility of self-exploration (non-social
learning). Using a multi-player treasure hunt game, we show that our model can
quantitatively capture human trade-offs between social and non-social learning.
Furthermore, our results indicate that these two components allow agents to
flexibly apply social learning to achieve their goals more efficiently.

Conclusion: TinyTroupe不仅是一个具体的Python实现，更是一种可应用于其他场景的新颖概念贡献，其开源库已发布。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) have led to a new class of
autonomous agents, renewing and expanding interest in the area. LLM-powered
Multiagent Systems (MAS) have thus emerged, both for assistive and simulation
purposes, yet tools for realistic human behavior simulation -- with its
distinctive challenges and opportunities -- remain underdeveloped. Existing MAS
libraries and tools lack fine-grained persona specifications, population
sampling facilities, experimentation support, and integrated validation, among
other key capabilities, limiting their utility for behavioral studies, social
simulation, and related applications. To address these deficiencies, in this
work we introduce TinyTroupe, a simulation toolkit enabling detailed persona
definitions (e.g., nationality, age, occupation, personality, beliefs,
behaviors) and programmatic control via numerous LLM-driven mechanisms. This
allows for the concise formulation of behavioral problems of practical
interest, either at the individual or group level, and provides effective means
for their solution. TinyTroupe's components are presented using representative
working examples, such as brainstorming and market research sessions, thereby
simultaneously clarifying their purpose and demonstrating their usefulness.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of selected aspects are also provided,
highlighting possibilities, limitations, and trade-offs. The approach, though
realized as a specific Python implementation, is meant as a novel conceptual
contribution, which can be partially or fully incorporated in other contexts.

Conclusion: LPMs是AI研究的新路径，补充个体智能研究，推动集体智能和政策测试。

Abstract: Many of society's most pressing challenges, from pandemic response to supply
chain disruptions to climate adaptation, emerge from the collective behavior of
millions of autonomous agents making decisions over time. Large Population
Models (LPMs) offer an approach to understand these complex systems by
simulating entire populations with realistic behaviors and interactions at
unprecedented scale. LPMs extend traditional modeling approaches through three
key innovations: computational methods that efficiently simulate millions of
agents simultaneously, mathematical frameworks that learn from diverse
real-world data streams, and privacy-preserving communication protocols that
bridge virtual and physical environments. This allows researchers to observe
how agent behavior aggregates into system-level outcomes and test interventions
before real-world implementation. While current AI advances primarily focus on
creating "digital humans" with sophisticated individual capabilities, LPMs
develop "digital societies" where the richness of interactions reveals emergent
phenomena. By bridging individual agent behavior and population-scale dynamics,
LPMs offer a complementary path in AI research illuminating collective
intelligence and providing testing grounds for policies and social innovations
before real-world deployment. We discuss the technical foundations and some
open problems here. LPMs are implemented by the AgentTorch framework

Conclusion: AnalogTester为模拟电路设计的LLM专业化提供了基础训练数据，具有扩展潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements have demonstrated the significant potential of large
language models (LLMs) in analog circuit design. Nevertheless, testbench
construction for analog circuits remains manual, creating a critical bottleneck
in achieving fully automated design processes. Particularly when replicating
circuit designs from academic papers, manual Testbench construction demands
time-intensive implementation and frequent adjustments, which fails to address
the dynamic diversity and flexibility requirements for automation. AnalogTester
tackles automated analog design challenges through an LLM-powered pipeline: a)
domain-knowledge integration, b) paper information extraction, c) simulation
scheme synthesis, and d) testbench code generation with Tsinghua Electronic
Design (TED). AnalogTester has demonstrated automated Testbench generation
capabilities for three fundamental analog circuit types: operational amplifiers
(op-amps), bandgap references (BGRs), and low-dropout regulators (LDOs), while
maintaining a scalable framework for adaptation to broader circuit topologies.
Furthermore, AnalogTester can generate circuit knowledge data and TED code
corpus, establishing fundamental training datasets for LLM specialization in
analog circuit design automation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于后推控制屏障函数（CBFs）的新型协作驱赶策略，用于协调多个驱赶者将逃避者安全引导至目标区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异质群体（驱赶者和逃避者）中因间接交互导致的系统欠驱动问题，确保驱赶任务的安全性和完成性。

Method: 构建目标到达和避障的双重CBFs，将欠驱动系统转化为控制仿射结构，并采用后推方法设计分层屏障函数的控制输入。

Result: 提出了集中式和分散式算法实现，验证了策略在多机器人驱赶中的有效性和安全性。

Conclusion: 基于后推CBFs的协作驱赶策略能安全高效地完成多逃避者驱赶任务。

Abstract: We propose a novel cooperative herding strategy through backstepping control
barrier functions (CBFs), which coordinates multiple herders to herd a group of
evaders safely towards a designated goal region. For the herding system with
heterogeneous groups involving herders and evaders, the behavior of the evaders
can only be influenced indirectly by the herders' motion, especially when the
evaders follow an inverse dynamics model and respond solely to repulsive
interactions from the herders. This indirect interaction mechanism inherently
renders the overall system underactuated. To address this issue, we first
construct separate CBFs for the dual objectives of goal reaching and collision
avoidance, which ensure both herding completion and safety guarantees. Then, we
reformulate the underactuated herding dynamics into a control-affine structure
and employ a backstepping approach to recursively design control inputs for the
hierarchical barrier functions, avoiding taking derivatives of the higher-order
system. Finally, we present a cooperative herding strategy based on
backstepping CBFs that allow herders to safely herd multiple evaders into the
goal region. In addition, centralized and decentralized implementations of the
proposed algorithm are developed, further enhancing its flexibility and
applicability. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the
effectiveness and safety of the proposed strategy in multi-robot herding.

*Wenjing Zhang,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的异步多智能体强化学习方法ToMacVF，通过精细的时间信用分配和完整的宏动作执行信息收集，解决了现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异步MARL方法在宏动作端点采样数据，导致宏动作执行过程表示不完整且信用分配不准确。

Method: 设计了ToMacVF架构和Mac-SJERT缓冲区，结合To-Mac-IGM一致性要求，实现精细信用分配。

Result: 实验表明ToMacVF在性能、适应性和鲁棒性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ToMacVF为异步MARL提供了一种更全面和精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing asynchronous MARL methods based on MacDec-POMDP typically construct
training trajectory buffers by simply sampling limited and biased data at the
endpoints of macro-actions, and directly apply conventional MARL methods on the
buffers. As a result, these methods lead to an incomplete and inaccurate
representation of the macro-action execution process, along with unsuitable
credit assignments. To solve these problems, the Temporal Macro-action Value
Factorization (ToMacVF) is proposed to achieve fine-grained temporal credit
assignment for macro-action contributions. A centralized training buffer,
called Macro-action Segmented Joint Experience Replay Trajectory (Mac-SJERT),
is designed to incorporate with ToMacVF to collect accurate and complete
macro-action execution information, supporting a more comprehensive and precise
representation of the macro-action process. To ensure principled and
fine-grained asynchronous value factorization, the consistency requirement
between joint and individual macro-action selection called Temporal
Macro-action based IGM (To-Mac-IGM) is formalized, proving that it generalizes
the synchronous cases. Based on To-Mac-IGM, a modularized ToMacVF architecture,
which satisfies CTDE principle, is designed to conveniently integrate previous
value factorization methods. Next, the ToMacVF algorithm is devised as an
implementation of the ToMacVF architecture. Experimental results demonstrate
that, compared to asynchronous baselines, our ToMacVF algorithm not only
achieves optimal performance but also exhibits strong adaptability and
robustness across various asynchronous multi-agent experimental scenarios.

Motivation: 金融系统需要高效检测欺诈交易以降低风险，提升用户体验和业务可持续性。

Method: 在RoFormer模型中引入相对距离旋转编码（ReDRE），增强时间序列数据的表征能力。

Result: ReDRE通过更好地捕捉时间依赖性和事件关系，提高了欺诈检测的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融行业提供了一种新颖且有效的欺诈检测解决方案。

Abstract: Fraud detection is one of the most important challenges that financial
systems must address. Detecting fraudulent transactions is critical for payment
gateway companies like Flow Payment, which process millions of transactions
monthly and require robust security measures to mitigate financial risks.
Increasing transaction authorization rates while reducing fraud is essential
for providing a good user experience and building a sustainable business. For
this reason, discovering novel and improved methods to detect fraud requires
continuous research and investment for any company that wants to succeed in
this industry. In this work, we introduced a novel method for detecting
transactional fraud by incorporating the Relative Distance Rotating Encoding
(ReDRE) in the RoFormer model. The incorporation of angle rotation using ReDRE
enhances the characterization of time series data within a Transformer, leading
to improved fraud detection by better capturing temporal dependencies and event
relationships.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain represents visual information is a fundamental
challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While AI-driven decoding
of neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating
multimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical
hurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches
often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural
representation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for
integrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural
representation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the
potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we
further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural
modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the
brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping
to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from
different modalities of neural imaging. Beyond methodological advancements,
BrainFLORA offers novel implications for cognitive neuroscience and
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空中交通管制（ATC）工作压力大且容错率低，检测压力对维持安全至关重要，但处理语音数据需遵守隐私法规（如GDPR）。

Method: 评估了多种架构用于匿名化ATC语音数据的压力检测，使用了匿名化的SUSAS数据集和ATC模拟数据集。

Result: 最佳网络在匿名化SUSAS数据集上达到93.6%的准确率，在匿名化ATC模拟数据集上达到80.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: 隐私保护不会阻碍构建高性能的深度学习模型。

Abstract: Air traffic control (ATC) demands multi-tasking under time pressure with high
consequences of an error. This can induce stress. Detecting stress is a key
point in maintaining the high safety standards of ATC. However, processing ATC
voice data entails privacy restrictions, e.g. the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) law. Anonymizing the ATC voice data is one way to comply with
these restrictions. In this paper, different architectures for stress detection
for anonymized ATCO speech are evaluated. Our best networks reach a stress
detection accuracy of 93.6% on an anonymized version of the Speech Under
Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) dataset and an accuracy of 80.1% on our
anonymized ATC simulation dataset. This shows that privacy does not have to be
an impediment in building well-performing deep-learning-based models.

TL;DR: 论文提出多模态和多粒度的生成式错误校正方法，结合发音信息提升带口音语音识别的准确性，显著降低词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR技术已有显著进步，但在处理带口音语音时性能下降。生成式错误校正（GER）虽优于传统LM方法，但在口音场景中缺乏针对性。

Method: 提出多模态GER（整合语音模态的发音信息）和多粒度GER（结合细粒度音素级信息），通过LoRA微调利用发音和语义信息。采用三阶段训练策略和HDMoLE方法融合多口音LoRA专家。

Result: 在多口音英语数据集上，相比Whisper-large-v3基线，词错误率相对降低67.35%。

Conclusion: 多模态和多粒度GER方法有效提升带口音语音识别的准确性，HDMoLE方法成功应对口音多样性挑战。

Abstract: Despite substantial improvements in ASR, performance tends to degrade when
faced with adverse conditions such as speaker accents. Generative error
correction (GER) leverages the rich linguistic knowledge and exceptional
reasoning ability of LLMs, significantly outperforming typical LM methods.
However, it lacks specificity in accented speech scenarios. In this study, we
leverage GER to improve the accuracy of transcription predictions by addressing
the two primary features of accented speech recognition. To fully leverage
pronunciation information, we propose the multi-modal GER, which integrates
pronunciation information from the speech modality, and the multi-granularity
GER, which incorporates fine-grained phoneme-level information related to
pronunciation. These two methods enable the LLM to utilize the pronunciation
information of accented speech and the semantic information from word-level
hypotheses for accurate transcription predictions through LoRA fine-tuning. On
the one hand, we employ a three-stage training strategy to train separate
multi-modal GER models for each accent to obtain mono-accent LoRA experts. By
adopting our proposed HDMoLE method, which incorporates hierarchical routing
and dynamic thresholds within the mixture of LoRA experts, we effectively merge
multiple mono-accent LoRA experts within a single multi-modal GER to overcome
the challenges posed by accent diversity. On the other hand, multi-granularity
GER leverages the N-best word-level and phoneme-level hypotheses generated by
the HDMoLE model to predict the final accented speech transcriptions.
Experimental results on the multi-accent English dataset demonstrate the
efficacy of our proposed methods. Our methods achieve a remarkable relative WER
reduction of 67.35% compared to the Whisper-large-v3 baseline.

Conclusion: 语言引导方法在空间音频理解中具有潜力，为空间场景分析提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for spatial audio understanding
of first-order ambisonic (FOA) signals through a question answering (QA)
paradigm, aiming to extend the scope of sound event localization and detection
(SELD) towards spatial scene understanding and reasoning. First, we curate and
release fine-grained spatio-temporal textual descriptions for the STARSS23
dataset using a rule-based approach, and further enhance linguistic diversity
using large language model (LLM)-based rephrasing. We also introduce a QA
dataset aligned with the STARSS23 scenes, covering various aspects such as
event presence, localization, spatial, and temporal relationships. To increase
language variety, we again leverage LLMs to generate multiple rephrasings per
question. Finally, we develop a baseline spatial audio QA model that takes FOA
signals and natural language questions as input and provides answers regarding
various occurrences, temporal, and spatial relationships of sound events in the
scene formulated as a classification task. Despite being trained solely with
scene-level question answering supervision, our model achieves performance that
is comparable to a fully supervised sound event localization and detection
model trained with frame-level spatiotemporal annotations. The results
highlight the potential of language-guided approaches for spatial audio
understanding and open new directions for integrating linguistic supervision
into spatial scene analysis.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过语音转换（VC）技术实现Lombard说话风格迁移，比较了隐式和显式声学特征条件模型，发现隐式条件策略在保持说话人相似性的同时，实现了与显式条件模型相当的清晰度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lombard风格的TTS系统可提升语音清晰度，适用于听力损失和嘈杂环境，但数据获取困难，因此探索语音转换作为替代方法。

Method: 比较了隐式和显式声学特征条件的语音转换模型，用于Lombard风格迁移。

Result: 隐式条件策略在清晰度提升和说话人相似性保持方面表现与显式条件模型相当。

Conclusion: 隐式条件策略是一种有效的Lombard风格迁移方法，适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems in Lombard speaking style can improve the
overall intelligibility of speech, useful for hearing loss and noisy
conditions. However, training those models requires a large amount of data and
the Lombard effect is challenging to record due to speaker and noise
variability and tiring recording conditions. Voice conversion (VC) has been
shown to be a useful augmentation technique to train TTS systems in the absence
of recorded data from the target speaker in the target speaking style. In this
paper, we are concerned with Lombard speaking style transfer. Our goal is to
convert speaker identity while preserving the acoustic attributes that define
the Lombard speaking style. We compare voice conversion models with implicit
and explicit acoustic feature conditioning. We observe that our proposed
implicit conditioning strategy achieves an intelligibility gain comparable to
the model conditioned on explicit acoustic features, while also preserving

TL;DR: 该研究创建了一个英语到约鲁巴语的语音到语音翻译语料库（BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1），通过混合架构和音频增强技术显著降低了成本，并开发了一个约鲁巴语TTS模型作为概念验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高资源到低资源语言对的语音到语音翻译数据集严重不足，尤其是英语到约鲁巴语。

Method: 利用现有约鲁巴语音频和转录数据，通过预训练AI模型生成英语音频，并开发音频增强算法AcoustAug。

Result: 生成了包含24,064个样本（41.20小时）的语料库，并开发了约鲁巴语TTS模型YoruTTS-0.5，其F0 RMSE值为63.54。

Conclusion: 该语料库架构可用于其他高资源到低资源的非洲语言数据集构建，缩小翻译领域的数字鸿沟。

Abstract: There is a major shortage of Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) datasets for
high resource-to-low resource language pairs such as English-to-Yoruba. Thus,
in this study, we curated the Bilingual English-to-Yoruba Speech-to-Speech
Translation Corpus Version 1 (BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1). The corpus is based on a
hybrid architecture we developed for large-scale direct S2ST corpus creation at
reduced cost. To achieve this, we leveraged non speech-to-speech Standard
Yoruba (SY) real-time audios and transcripts in the YORULECT Corpus as well as
the corresponding Standard English (SE) transcripts. YORULECT Corpus is small
scale(1,504) samples, and it does not have paired English audios. Therefore, we
generated the SE audios using pre-trained AI models (i.e. Facebook MMS). We
also developed an audio augmentation algorithm named AcoustAug based on three
latent acoustic features to generate augmented audios from the raw audios of
the two languages. BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 has 12,032 audio samples per language,
which gives a total of 24,064 sample size. The total audio duration for the two
languages is 41.20 hours. This size is quite significant. Beyond building S2ST
models, BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 can be used to build pretrained models or improve
existing ones. The created corpus and Coqui framework were used to build a
pretrained Yoruba TTS model (named YoruTTS-0.5) as a proof of concept. The
YoruTTS-0.5 gave a F0 RMSE value of 63.54 after 1,000 epochs, which indicates
moderate fundamental pitch similarity with the reference real-time audio.
Ultimately, the corpus architecture in this study can be leveraged by
researchers and developers to curate datasets for multilingual
high-resource-to-low-resource African languages. This will bridge the huge
digital divides in translations among high and low-resource language pairs.
BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 and YoruTTS-0.5 are publicly available at

*Bilkent Samsurya*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于2D FDTD的声波传播模拟框架，用于虚拟应用中低频声波现象的精确模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前行业声学建模方法未能全面捕捉声波现象，影响虚拟应用的沉浸感。

Method: 通过2D网格离散化场景几何，使用Python FDTD求解器模拟声波传播，生成多通道脉冲响应并集成到Unreal Engine音频管线。

Result: 测试结果与理论预期一致，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为低频声波现象模拟提供了可行方案，并具备商业化扩展潜力。

Abstract: Accurate sound propagation simulation is essential for delivering immersive
experiences in virtual applications, yet industry methods for acoustic modeling
often do not account for the full breadth of acoustic wave phenomena. This
paper proposes a novel two-dimensional (2D) finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD) framework that simulates sound propagation as a wave-based model in
Unreal Engine, with an emphasis on capturing lower frequency wave phenomena,
embedding occlusion, diffraction, reflection and interference in generated
impulse responses. The process begins by discretizing the scene geometry into a
2D grid via a top-down projection from which obstacle masks and boundary
conditions are derived. A Python-based FDTD solver injects a sine sweep at a
source position, and virtual quadraphonic microphone arrays record pressure
field responses at pre-defined listener positions. De-convolution of the
pressure responses yields multi-channel impulse responses that retain spatial
directionality which are then integrated into Unreal Engine's audio pipeline
for dynamic playback. Benchmark tests confirm agreement with analytical
expectations, and the paper outlines hybrid extensions aimed at commercial
viability.

Motivation: 在依赖音频提示的TSE系统中，说话者嵌入的质量对性能至关重要，但可能存在说话者身份混淆问题。本文从说话者一致性的角度改进TSE性能。

Method: 提出了一种说话者一致性感知的目标说话者提取方法，结合质心一致性损失和条件损失抑制。

Result: 实验验证了所提方法在提升TSE性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过确保说话者一致性，该方法显著提升了TSE性能。

Abstract: Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) uses a reference cue to extract the target
speech from a mixture. In TSE systems relying on audio cues, the speaker
embedding from the enrolled speech is crucial to performance. However, these
embeddings may suffer from speaker identity confusion. Unlike previous studies
that focus on improving speaker embedding extraction, we improve TSE
performance from the perspective of speaker consistency. In this paper, we
propose a speaker consistency-aware target speaker extraction method that
incorporates a centroid-based speaker consistency loss. This approach enhances
TSE performance by ensuring speaker consistency between the enrolled and
extracted speech. In addition, we integrate conditional loss suppression into
the training process. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods in advancing the TSE performance. A speech demo is
available online.\footnote{https://sc-tse.netlify.app/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前声音事件检测方法在开放环境中表现不佳，预测过于自信且缺乏不确定性度量，限制了其在新场景中的适应性。

Method: 采用集成方法，并提出EOW-Softmax进行置信度校准，同时将其应用于声音发生和重叠检测（SOD）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在开放环境中提升了性能，减少了过度自信，增强了处理未知场景的能力。

Conclusion: EOW-Softmax方法有效提升了声音事件检测在开放环境中的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sound event detection (SED) has made strong progress in controlled
environments with clear event categories. However, real-world applications
often take place in open environments. In such cases, current methods often
produce predictions with too much confidence and lack proper ways to measure
uncertainty. This limits their ability to adapt and perform well in new
situations. To solve this problem, we are the first to use ensemble methods in
SED to improve robustness against out-of-domain (OOD) inputs. We propose a
confidence calibration method called Energy-based Open-World Softmax
(EOW-Softmax), which helps the system better handle uncertainty in unknown
scenes. We further apply EOW-Softmax to sound occurrence and overlap detection
(SOD) by adjusting the prediction. In this way, the model becomes more
adaptable while keeping its ability to detect overlapping events. Experiments
show that our method improves performance in open environments. It reduces
overconfidence and increases the ability to handle OOD situations.

Motivation: 填补泰语语音情感识别领域缺乏大规模高质量语料库的空白。

Method: 通过专业演员录制脚本和即兴会话，使用众包标注情感，并设计质量控制方案。

Result: 语料库的标注一致性（Krippendorff's alpha）为0.692，人类识别准确率为0.772。

Conclusion: THAI-SER是一个高质量、公开可用的泰语情感识别语料库，为相关研究提供了基础资源。

Abstract: We present the first sizeable corpus of Thai speech emotion recognition,
THAI-SER, containing 41 hours and 36 minutes (27,854 utterances) from 100
recordings made in different recording environments: Zoom and two studio
setups. The recordings contain both scripted and improvised sessions, acted by
200 professional actors (112 females and 88 males, aged 18 to 55) and were
directed by professional directors. There are five primary emotions: neutral,
angry, happy, sad, and frustrated, assigned to the actors when recording
utterances. The utterances are annotated with an emotional category using
crowdsourcing. To control the annotation process's quality, we also design an
extensive filtering and quality control scheme to ensure that the majority
agreement score remains above 0.71. We evaluate our annotated corpus using two
metrics: inter-annotator reliability and human recognition accuracy.
Inter-annotator reliability score was calculated using Krippendorff's alpha,
where our corpus, after filtering, achieved an alpha score of 0.692, higher
than a recommendation of 0.667. For human recognition accuracy, our corpus
scored up to 0.772 post-filtering. We also provide the results of the model
trained on the corpus evaluated on both in-corpus and cross-corpus setups. The
corpus is publicly available under a Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0, as well as our
codes for the experiments.

Conclusion: MB-RIRs显著提升语音增强性能，数据集已公开免费下载。

Abstract: We investigate the effects of four strategies for improving the ecological
validity of synthetic room impulse response (RIR) datasets for monoaural Speech
Enhancement (SE). We implement three features on top of the traditional image
source method-based (ISM) shoebox RIRs: multiband absorption coefficients,
source directivity and receiver directivity. We additionally consider
mesh-based RIRs from the SoundSpaces dataset. We then train a DeepFilternet3
model for each RIR dataset and evaluate the performance on a test set of real
RIRs both objectively and subjectively. We find that RIRs which use
frequency-dependent acoustic absorption coefficients (MB-RIRs) can obtain
+0.51dB of SDR and a +8.9 MUSHRA score when evaluated on real RIRs. The MB-RIRs
dataset is publicly available for free download.

Conclusion: 该系统在自动评估文本到音乐生成任务中表现出色，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Evaluation of text-to-music systems is constrained by the cost and
availability of collecting experts for assessment. AudioMOS 2025 Challenge
track 1 is created to automatically predict music impression (MI) as well as
text alignment (TA) between the prompt and the generated musical piece. This
paper reports our winning system, which uses a dual-branch architecture with
pre-trained MuQ and RoBERTa models as audio and text encoders. A
cross-attention mechanism fuses the audio and text representations. For
training, we reframe the MI and TA prediction as a classification task. To
incorporate the ordinal nature of MOS scores, one-hot labels are converted to a
soft distribution using a Gaussian kernel. On the official test set, a single
model trained with this method achieves a system-level Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) of 0.991 for MI and 0.952 for TA, corresponding
to a relative improvement of 21.21\% in MI SRCC and 31.47\% in TA SRCC over the
challenge baseline.

response, models for detecting fake music have been proposed. In this work, we
explore the robustness of such systems under audio augmentations. To evaluate
model generalization, we constructed a dataset consisting of both real and

the performance of a recent state-of-the-art musical deepfake detection model
in the presence of audio augmentations. The performance of the model decreases
significantly even with the introduction of light augmentations.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) trained on audio spectrogram patches have emerged
as a prominent approach for learning self-supervised audio representations.
While several recent papers have evaluated key aspects of training MAEs on

building blocks, whereas the transformer community has seen steady integration
of newer architectural advancements. In this work, we propose AudioMAE++, a
revamped audio masked autoencoder with two such enhancements, namely
macaron-style transformer blocks with gated linear units. When pretrained on
the AudioSet dataset, the proposed AudioMAE++ models outperform existing MAE
based approaches on 10 diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating excellent
performance on audio classification and speech-based benchmarks. The proposed
AudioMAE++ models also demonstrate excellent scaling characteristics,
outperforming directly comparable standard MAE baselines with up to 4x more

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in end-to-end AI music generation, AI-driven modeling
of professional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) workflows remains challenging.
In particular, while there is growing interest in neural black-box modeling of
audio effect graphs (e.g. reverb, compression, equalization), AI-based
approaches struggle to replicate the nuanced signal flow and parameter
interactions used in professional workflows. Existing differentiable plugin
approaches often diverge from real-world tools, exhibiting inferior performance
relative to simplified neural controllers under equivalent computational
constraints. We introduce WildFX, a pipeline containerized with Docker for
generating multi-track audio mixing datasets with rich effect graphs, powered
by a professional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) backend. WildFX supports
seamless integration of cross-platform commercial plugins or any plugins in the
wild, in VST/VST3/LV2/CLAP formats, enabling structural complexity (e.g.,
sidechains, crossovers) and achieving efficient parallelized processing. A
minimalist metadata interface simplifies project/plugin configuration.
Experiments demonstrate the pipeline's validity through blind estimation of
mixing graphs, plugin/gain parameters, and its ability to bridge AI research
with practical DSP demands. The code is available on:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的学习范式——循环扩展（RE），超越了传统的机器学习和深度学习，通过分析模型自身行为的演化来实现自我迭代改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习专注于静态数据表示，而RE提出从模型行为中学习，以实现更智能、自适应的系统。

Method: RE通过多次映射数据并分析内部表示与性能信号，结合并行模型实例（MVRE）和异构架构（HMVRE），进一步提出可扩展的Sc-HMVRE。

Result: RE框架实现了行为感知的自进化系统，为智能模型提供了新的发展方向。

Conclusion: RE标志着深度学习从静态表示学习转向行为感知的自进化系统，为自适应人工智能奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces Recurrent Expansion (RE) as a new learning paradigm
that advances beyond conventional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).
While DL focuses on learning from static data representations, RE proposes an
additional dimension: learning from the evolving behavior of models themselves.
RE emphasizes multiple mappings of data through identical deep architectures
and analyzes their internal representations (i.e., feature maps) in conjunction
with observed performance signals such as loss. By incorporating these
behavioral traces, RE enables iterative self-improvement, allowing each model
version to gain insight from its predecessors. The framework is extended
through Multiverse RE (MVRE), which aggregates signals from parallel model
instances, and further through Heterogeneous MVRE (HMVRE), where models of
varying architectures contribute diverse perspectives. A scalable and adaptive
variant, Sc-HMVRE, introduces selective mechanisms and scale diversity for
real-world deployment. Altogether, RE presents a shift in DL: from purely
representational learning to behavior-aware, self-evolving systems. It lays the
groundwork for a new class of intelligent models capable of reasoning over
their own learning dynamics, offering a path toward scalable, introspective,
and adaptive artificial intelligence. A simple code example to support
beginners in running their own experiments is provided in Code Availability
Section of this paper.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释人工智能（XAI）的高效三重模块冗余（TMR）方法，用于提升深度神经网络（DNN）在比特翻转故障下的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，DNN的可靠性至关重要。TMR能有效提升可靠性，但开销较大，需选择性应用。

Method: 利用梯度基础的XAI技术（如LRP）计算DNN参数的重要性分数，选择关键权重进行TMR保护。

Result: 在VGG16和AlexNet模型上验证，该方法在比特错误率为10-4时，可靠性提升超过60%，且开销与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 基于XAI的TMR方法能高效提升DNN可靠性，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely employed in safety-critical domains,
where ensuring their reliability is essential. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)
is an effective technique to enhance the reliability of DNNs in the presence of
bit-flip faults. In order to handle the significant overhead of TMR, it is
applied selectively on the parameters and components with the highest
contribution at the model output. Hence, the accuracy of the selection
criterion plays the key role on the efficiency of TMR. This paper presents an
efficient TMR approach to enhance the reliability of DNNs against bit-flip
faults using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method. Since XAI can
provide valuable insights about the importance of individual neurons and
weights in the performance of the network, they can be applied as the selection
metric in TMR techniques. The proposed method utilizes a low-cost,
gradient-based XAI technique known as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to
calculate importance scores for DNN parameters. These scores are then used to
enhance the reliability of the model, with the most critical weights being
protected by TMR. The proposed approach is evaluated on two DNN models, VGG16
and AlexNet, using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results demonstrate
that the method can protect the AlexNet model at a bit error rate of 10-4,
achieving over 60% reliability improvement while maintaining the same overhead
as state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Farmers in developing regions like Karnataka, India, face a dual challenge:
navigating extreme market and climate volatility while being excluded from the
digital revolution due to literacy barriers. This paper presents a novel
decision support system that addresses both challenges through a unique
synthesis of machine learning and human-computer interaction. We propose a
hybrid recommendation engine that integrates two predictive models: a Random
Forest classifier to assess agronomic suitability based on soil, climate, and
real-time weather data, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to forecast
market prices for agronomically viable crops. This integrated approach shifts
the paradigm from "what can grow?" to "what is most profitable to grow?",
providing a significant advantage in mitigating economic risk. The system is
delivered through an end-to-end, voice-based interface in the local Kannada
language, leveraging fine-tuned speech recognition and high-fidelity speech
synthesis models to ensure accessibility for low-literacy users. Our results
show that the Random Forest model achieves 98.5% accuracy in suitability
prediction, while the LSTM model forecasts harvest-time prices with a low
margin of error. By providing data-driven, economically optimized
recommendations through an inclusive interface, this work offers a scalable and
impactful solution to enhance the financial resilience of marginalized farming
communities.

Conclusion: 研究为网络科学和机器学习提供了新见解，可能启发更具生物启发性的神经网络设计。

Abstract: In recent years, graph-based machine learning techniques, such as
reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have garnered significant
attention. While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship
between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive
performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks,
particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work
advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation,
incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous
degree distributions and community structures, which are typical
characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a
nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model
networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a
biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We
examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image
classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect
performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely
interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The
comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our
findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth
further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and
machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more
biologically informed neural networks.

### [303] [LoRA Is Slower Than You Think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08833)
*Seokmin Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA是一种广泛用于微调大语言模型的技术，通过引入少量可训练的低秩权重矩阵减少参数更新量，但速度提升不一致。本文分析其性能并提出更高效的微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在不同模型架构和训练设置中速度提升不一致，作者希望探究其限制因素并提出改进方法。

Method: 对LoRA性能进行全面分析，提出几种更高效的微调方法，并进行实证评估。

Result: 新方法在性能上与LoRA相当或更优，同时提供更一致的训练速度提升。

Conclusion: 本文为资源受限下优化LLM微调提供了实用指南和见解。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most widely used techniques for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By introducing a small number of
trainable low-rank weight matrices, LoRA substantially reduces the number of
parameters that need to be updated, offering significant advantages in memory
consumption and computational efficiency compared to full fine-tuning. However,
we observed that LoRA does not consistently provide speed improvements across
all model architectures and training setups. Motivated by this inconsistency,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance and investigate the
underlying factors limiting its speedup. Based on our findings, we propose
several methods for more efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. We empirically evaluate
these methods and compare them to LoRA, demonstrating that our approach
achieves comparable or superior performance while delivering more consistent
training speed improvements. Our work offers valuable insights and practical
guidelines for practitioners seeking to optimize LLM fine-tuning under resource
constraints.

Motivation: 传统数值方法在处理大规模动态海洋域中的污染物传输时面临复杂性和规模挑战，需要一种更高效、灵活的方法。

Method: 采用PINN框架，通过嵌入物理定律和拟合噪声合成数据（由有限差分法生成）来训练神经网络，结合混合损失函数（包括PDE残差、边界/初始条件一致性和加权数据拟合项）。

Result: 模型实现了物理一致的预测，能够处理非线性动态和边界/初始条件的约束，并通过Julia语言生态系统实现高性能模拟。

Conclusion: PINN框架为传统求解器提供了一种可扩展且灵活的替代方案，适用于复杂污染物传输问题。

Abstract: Traditional numerical methods often struggle with the complexity and scale of
modeling pollutant transport across vast and dynamic oceanic domains. This
paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to simulate
the dispersion of pollutants governed by the 2D advection-diffusion equation.
The model achieves physically consistent predictions by embedding physical laws
and fitting to noisy synthetic data, generated via a finite difference method
(FDM), directly into the neural network training process. This approach
addresses challenges such as non-linear dynamics and the enforcement of
boundary and initial conditions. Synthetic data sets, augmented with varying
noise levels, are used to capture real-world variability. The training
incorporates a hybrid loss function including PDE residuals, boundary/initial
condition conformity, and a weighted data fit term. The approach takes
advantage of the Julia language scientific computing ecosystem for
high-performance simulations, offering a scalable and flexible alternative to
traditional solvers

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer神经网络的新方法，用于检测洗钱行为，通过对比学习生成时间序列表示，并结合BH程序控制假阳性率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统规则或LSTM架构在洗钱检测中的局限性，提出更高效且低监督需求的方法。

Method: 1. 通过对比学习无监督学习时间序列表示；2. 利用这些表示生成洗钱评分；3. 采用BH程序控制假阳性率。

Result: Transformer能有效捕捉洗钱模式，检测能力优于规则或LSTM方法，同时控制假阳性率。

Conclusion: 新方法在洗钱检测中表现优异，减少专家监督需求，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The present work tackles the money laundering detection problem. A new
procedure is introduced which exploits structured time series of both
qualitative and quantitative data by means of a transformer neural network. The
first step of this procedure aims at learning representations of time series
through contrastive learning (without any labels). The second step leverages
these representations to generate a money laundering scoring of all
observations. A two-thresholds approach is then introduced, which ensures a
controlled false-positive rate by means of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)
procedure. Experiments confirm that the transformer is able to produce general
representations that succeed in exploiting money laundering patterns with
minimal supervision from domain experts. It also illustrates the higher ability
of the new procedure for detecting nonfraudsters as well as fraudsters, while
keeping the false positive rate under control. This greatly contrasts with
rule-based procedures or the ones based on LSTM architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为wd1的新方法，通过加权似然优化扩散大语言模型的推理能力，避免了传统RL方法中的计算开销和偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）的推理能力提升是一个开放性问题，传统RL方法因似然函数难以处理而引入计算开销和潜在偏差。

Method: 提出wd1方法，将目标重新表述为加权似然，仅需对当前参数化策略似然进行单次近似。

Result: 在广泛使用的推理基准测试中，wd1无需监督微调或监督数据，性能优于现有RL方法，准确率提升高达16%，同时减少训练时间和梯度步的函数评估次数。

Conclusion: wd1因其高效性和简单性，成为提升dLLMs推理能力的更优方法。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based large language models
(dLLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) remains an open problem. The
intractability of dLLMs likelihood function necessitates approximating the
current, old, and reference policy likelihoods at each policy optimization
step. This reliance introduces additional computational overhead and lead to
potentially large bias -- particularly when approximation errors occur in the
denominator of policy ratios used for importance sampling. To mitigate these
issues, we introduce $\mathtt{wd1}$, a novel policy optimization approach that
reformulates the objective as a weighted likelihood, requiring only a single
approximation for the current parametrized policy likelihood. Experiments on
widely used reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathtt{wd1}$, without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or any supervised data, outperforms existing RL
methods for dLLMs, achieving up to 16% higher accuracy. $\mathtt{wd1}$ delivers
additional computational gains, including reduced training time and fewer
function evaluations (NFEs) per gradient step. These findings, combined with
the simplicity of method's implementation and R1-Zero-like training (no SFT),
position $\mathtt{wd1}$ as a more effective and efficient method for applying
RL to dLLMs reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究分布式学习问题，探讨在DAG中学习代理如何通过观察父节点的预测和自身特征实现信息聚合，并分析DAG深度对结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式学习中代理如何通过有限观察和协作实现全局最优模型的问题，特别是在DAG结构中。

Method: 代理按DAG拓扑顺序学习，利用自身观察的特征和父节点的预测作为额外特征训练模型。

Result: 理论上下界表明DAG深度是关键参数，信息聚合在足够长的路径上可能实现，但某些分布下无法实现。

Conclusion: DAG深度是信息聚合的关键，实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We study a distributed learning problem in which learning agents are embedded
in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). There is a fixed and arbitrary distribution
over feature/label pairs, and each agent or vertex in the graph is able to
directly observe only a subset of the features -- potentially a different
subset for every agent. The agents learn sequentially in some order consistent
with a topological sort of the DAG, committing to a model mapping observations
to predictions of the real-valued label. Each agent observes the predictions of
their parents in the DAG, and trains their model using both the features of the
instance that they directly observe, and the predictions of their parents as
additional features. We ask when this process is sufficient to achieve
\emph{information aggregation}, in the sense that some agent in the DAG is able
to learn a model whose error is competitive with the best model that could have
been learned (in some hypothesis class) with direct access to \emph{all}
features, despite the fact that no single agent in the network has such access.
We give upper and lower bounds for this problem for both linear and general
hypothesis classes. Our results identify the \emph{depth} of the DAG as the key
parameter: information aggregation can occur over sufficiently long paths in
the DAG, assuming that all of the relevant features are well represented along
the path, and there are distributions over which information aggregation cannot
occur even in the linear case, and even in arbitrarily large DAGs that do not
have sufficient depth (such as a hub-and-spokes topology in which the spoke
vertices collectively see all the features). We complement our theoretical
results with a comprehensive set of experiments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制的迁移学习方法（TAT），利用阿尔茨海默病（AD）数据增强路易体病（LBD）的诊断，解决了数据稀缺和领域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBD是一种常见但研究不足的痴呆症，诊断数据稀缺且与AD数据存在领域偏移，限制了深度学习的应用。

Method: 使用结构MRI提取的结构连接性（SC）作为训练数据，通过TAT自适应分配权重，突出疾病可迁移特征并抑制领域特异性特征。

Result: 实验证明TAT能有效减少领域偏移，提高LBD诊断准确性。

Conclusion: TAT为数据稀缺和领域偏移条件下的罕见疾病诊断提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Lewy Body Disease (LBD) is a common yet understudied form of dementia that
imposes a significant burden on public health. It shares clinical similarities
with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as both progress through stages of normal
cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. A major obstacle in LBD
diagnosis is data scarcity, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning. In
contrast, AD datasets are more abundant, offering potential for knowledge
transfer. However, LBD and AD data are typically collected from different sites
using different machines and protocols, resulting in a distinct domain shift.
To effectively leverage AD data while mitigating domain shift, we propose a
Transferability Aware Transformer (TAT) that adapts knowledge from AD to
enhance LBD diagnosis. Our method utilizes structural connectivity (SC) derived
from structural MRI as training data. Built on the attention mechanism, TAT
adaptively assigns greater weights to disease-transferable features while
suppressing domain-specific ones, thereby reducing domain shift and improving
diagnostic accuracy with limited LBD data. The experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of TAT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to explore domain adaptation from AD to LBD under conditions of data scarcity
and domain shift, providing a promising framework for domain-adaptive diagnosis
of rare diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本NAS方法的有效性、稳定性和通用性不足，需要更高效的训练免费代理来加速架构估计。

Method: 使用加权响应相关性（WRCor）作为代理，通过计算不同输入样本响应之间的相关系数矩阵来评估架构的表达性和泛化性。

Result: WRCor及其投票代理在代理评估中表现优于现有方法，NAS算法在不同搜索空间中优于大多数现有算法，并在ImageNet-1k上实现了22.1%的测试错误率。

Conclusion: WRCor是一种高效且通用的训练免费代理，能够显著提升NAS的效率和性能。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically
designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of
NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training
multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods
use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their
effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel
training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor).
WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different
input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which
can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on
proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more
efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with
different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on
architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most
existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can
discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset
within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedRAS是一个通信高效的联邦推荐系统框架，通过动作共享策略减少通信开销，同时保持推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦推荐系统（FedRecs）存在通信开销高和训练效率低的问题，现有压缩方法导致性能下降。

Method: 采用动作共享策略，将梯度聚类为有限的动作进行通信，而非直接压缩嵌入矩阵，并引入自适应聚类机制。

Result: 实验表明，FedRAS能减少96.88%的通信负载，且不影响推荐性能。

Conclusion: FedRAS有效解决了通信和效率问题，适用于异构环境。

Abstract: As a promising privacy-aware collaborative model training paradigm, Federated
Learning (FL) is becoming popular in the design of distributed recommender
systems. However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from
two major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive
item embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low
training efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network
environments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ
various compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the
parameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from
model performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,
this paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,
which adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item
embedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication
rather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud
server can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since
gradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining
the directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors
compared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space.
To accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS
incorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the
number of actions. Comprehensive experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate
that FedRAS can reduce the size of communication payloads by up to 96.88%,
while not sacrificing recommendation performance within various heterogeneous
scenarios. We have open-sourced FedRAS at

Abstract: The field of AI research is advancing at an unprecedented pace, enabling
automated hypothesis generation and experimental design across diverse domains

structured reasoning processes. Our findings reveal that a relatively small
model, when equipped with a well-compressed literature database and a
structured reasoning framework, can outperform powerful general-purpose

self-ranked top-30% submissions to ICLR 2025. Moreover, when limited to
high-confidence predictions, our system achieves an acceptance rate exceeding
90% on the ICLR 2025 test set, underscoring its potential to significantly
enhance the quality and efficiency of hypothesis generation and experimental
design. The code is released at

Result: 在多个数据集上，DAFOS显著提升训练速度和准确性，最高实现12.6倍加速和F1分数提升。

Conclusion: DAFOS为大规模GNN训练提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming an essential tool for learning from
graph-structured data, however uniform neighbor sampling and static fanout
settings frequently limit GNNs' scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we
propose the Dynamic Adaptive Fanout Optimization Sampler (DAFOS), a novel
approach that dynamically adjusts the fanout based on model performance and
prioritizes important nodes during training. Our approach leverages node
scoring based on node degree to focus computational resources on structurally
important nodes, incrementing the fanout as the model training progresses.
DAFOS also integrates an early stopping mechanism to halt training when
performance gains diminish. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets,
ogbnarxiv, Reddit, and ogbn-products, demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves training speed and accuracy compared to a
state-of-the-art approach. DAFOS achieves a 3.57x speedup on the ogbn-arxiv
dataset and a 12.6x speedup on the Reddit dataset while improving the F1 score
from 68.5% to 71.21% on ogbn-arxiv and from 73.78% to 76.88% on the
ogbn-products dataset, respectively. These results highlight the potential of
DAFOS as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale GNN training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习（ML）在信息物理系统（CPS）中的广泛应用，RL因其处理复杂动态环境的能力而备受关注。然而，安全关键应用需要RL不仅有效，还需具备可证明的安全性。现有方法（如Safe-RL和AMLAS）无法完全满足RL的安全保证需求。

Method: 本文通过迭代过程将AMLAS方法适配到RL领域，提出了AMLAS-RL框架，并通过一个轮式车辆避障任务的案例进行了演示。

Result: AMLAS-RL框架能够为RL系统生成系统化的安全保证论证，解决了现有方法在RL生命周期中的不足。

Conclusion: AMLAS-RL为RL在安全关键应用中的安全保证提供了结构化指导，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has led to its increasing
integration into cyber-physical systems (CPS) across diverse domains. While CPS
offer powerful capabilities, incorporating ML components introduces significant
safety and assurance challenges. Among ML techniques, reinforcement learning
(RL) is particularly suited for CPS due to its capacity to handle complex,
dynamic environments where explicit models of interaction between system and
environment are unavailable or difficult to construct. However, in
safety-critical applications, this learning process must not only be effective
but demonstrably safe. Safe-RL methods aim to address this by incorporating
safety constraints during learning, yet they fall short in providing systematic
assurance across the RL lifecycle. The AMLAS methodology offers structured
guidance for assuring the safety of supervised learning components, but it does
not directly apply to the unique challenges posed by RL. In this paper, we
adapt AMLAS to provide a framework for generating assurance arguments for an
RL-enabled system through an iterative process; AMLAS-RL. We demonstrate
AMLAS-RL using a running example of a wheeled vehicle tasked with reaching a
target goal without collision.

Result: TSFMs在数据有限时表现更优，提供更可靠的预测区间和更稳定的校准过程，尤其在数据稀缺时优势更明显。

Conclusion: 基础模型在时间序列共形预测中具有潜力，特别是在数据受限的情况下，能显著提升预测可靠性。

Abstract: The zero-shot capabilities of foundation models (FMs) for time series
forecasting offer promising potentials in conformal prediction, as most of the
available data can be allocated to calibration. This study compares the
performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with traditional methods,
including statistical models and gradient boosting, within a conformal
prediction setting. Our findings highlight two key advantages of TSFMs. First,
when the volume of data is limited, TSFMs provide more reliable conformalized
prediction intervals than classic models, thanks to their superior predictive
accuracy. Second, the calibration process is more stable because more data are
used for calibration. Morever, the fewer data available, the more pronounced
these benefits become, as classic models require a substantial amount of data
for effective training. These results underscore the potential of foundation
models in improving conformal prediction reliability in time series
applications, particularly in data-constrained cases. All the code to reproduce
the experiments is available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标如AUC和F1-score未能反映财务结果，可能误导战略决策，因此需要一种更贴近业务需求的评估方法。

Method: e-Profits结合客户特定价值、保留概率和干预成本，利用Kaplan-Meier生存分析估计个性化保留率，支持细粒度的客户级评估。

Result: 在电信数据集上测试六种分类器，e-Profits改变了模型排名，揭示了传统指标忽略的财务优势，并为高价值客户提供投资回报洞察。

Conclusion: e-Profits是一种直观的后验工具，适用于业务场景中的模型评估，尤其适合注重利润驱动的营销和分析团队。

Abstract: Retention campaigns in customer relationship management often rely on churn
prediction models evaluated using traditional metrics such as AUC and F1-score.
However, these metrics fail to reflect financial outcomes and may mislead
strategic decisions. We introduce e-Profits, a novel business-aligned
evaluation metric that quantifies model performance based on customer-specific
value, retention probability, and intervention costs. Unlike existing
profit-based metrics such as Expected Maximum Profit, which assume fixed
population-level parameters, e-Profits uses Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to
estimate personalised retention rates and supports granular, per customer
evaluation. We benchmark six classifiers across two telecom datasets (IBM Telco

TL;DR: 论文提出了图神经网络（GNN）在求解偏微分方程（PDE）时所需消息传递迭代次数的严格下界，显著减少了超参数调优的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过将问题的物理特性与GNN的消息传递需求联系起来，为三类基本PDE（双曲、抛物和椭圆）推导出下界，以减少计算成本并提高效率。

Method: 研究PDE的物理常数、时空离散化与GNN消息传递机制之间的关系，推导出迭代次数的下界。

Result: 当迭代次数低于下界时，信息无法有效传播，导致解质量差；满足下界时，GNN能准确捕捉现象学，得到高精度解。

Conclusion: 通过四个方程示例验证了下界的严格性，表明该方法能有效指导GNN在PDE求解中的应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes sharp lower bounds for the number of message passing
iterations required in graph neural networks (GNNs) when solving partial
differential equations (PDE). This significantly reduces the need for
exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. Bounds are derived for the three fundamental
classes of PDEs (hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic) by relating the physical
characteristics of the problem in question to the message-passing requirement
of GNNs. In particular, we investigate the relationship between the physical
constants of the equations governing the problem, the spatial and temporal
discretisation and the message passing mechanisms in GNNs.
  When the number of message passing iterations is below these proposed limits,
information does not propagate efficiently through the network, resulting in
poor solutions, even for deep GNN architectures. In contrast, when the
suggested lower bound is satisfied, the GNN parameterisation allows the model
to accurately capture the underlying phenomenology, resulting in solvers of
adequate accuracy.
  Examples are provided for four different examples of equations that show the
sharpness of the proposed lower bounds.

Motivation: 解决现有语音分离模型计算和参数固定、无法适应不同计算需求或资源的问题，特别是在嵌入式设备上的应用。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在语音分离和增强任务中表现优异，可与多计算预算的先进模型竞争。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了语音分离网络的动态计算扩展，同时保持高性能和可解释性。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based single-channel speech separation has
improved considerably, in large part driven by increasingly compute- and
parameter-efficient neural network architectures. Most such architectures are,
however, designed with a fixed compute and parameter budget, and consequently
cannot scale to varying compute demands or resources, which limits their use in
embedded and heterogeneous devices such as mobile phones and hearables. To
enable such use-cases we design a neural network architecture for speech
separation capable of early-exit, and we propose an uncertainty-aware
probabilistic framework to jointly model the clean speech signal and error
variance which we use to derive probabilistic early-exit conditions in terms of
desired signal-to-noise ratios. We evaluate our methods on both speech
separation and enhancement tasks, and we show that a single early-exit model
can be competitive with state-of-the-art models trained at many compute and
parameter budgets. Our framework enables fine-grained dynamic compute-scaling
of speech separation networks while achieving state-of-the-art performance and
interpretable exit conditions.

Motivation: 数据偏见是算法歧视的主要驱动因素，但研究不足，阻碍了检测和缓解偏见的计算最佳实践的发展。

Method: 研究三种常见数据偏见的单独和联合影响，开发了检测机制并整合为数据偏见配置文件（DBP）。

Result: 发现弱势群体在训练集中的代表性不足对歧视的影响较小，而代理和标签偏见的组合更为关键。DBP能有效预测歧视风险。

Conclusion: DBP为系统性记录偏见信号提供了初步框架，通过数据视角连接了算法公平研究和反歧视政策。

Abstract: Undesirable biases encoded in the data are key drivers of algorithmic
discrimination. Their importance is widely recognized in the algorithmic
fairness literature, as well as legislation and standards on
anti-discrimination in AI. Despite this recognition, data biases remain
understudied, hindering the development of computational best practices for
their detection and mitigation. In this work, we present three common data
biases and study their individual and joint effect on algorithmic
discrimination across a variety of datasets, models, and fairness measures. We
find that underrepresentation of vulnerable populations in training sets is
less conducive to discrimination than conventionally affirmed, while
combinations of proxies and label bias can be far more critical. Consequently,
we develop dedicated mechanisms to detect specific types of bias, and combine
them into a preliminary construct we refer to as the Data Bias Profile (DBP).
This initial formulation serves as a proof of concept for how different bias
signals can be systematically documented. Through a case study with popular
fairness datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DBP in predicting
the risk of discriminatory outcomes and the utility of fairness-enhancing
interventions. Overall, this article bridges algorithmic fairness research and
anti-discrimination policy through a data-centric lens.

Result: 在洛杉矶的实验中，模型准确复制了真实出行模式，性能与传统模型相当，但成本更低、扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 该框架为旅行需求建模提供了高效、可扩展的替代方案，适用于不同区域。

Abstract: Travel demand models are critical tools for planning, policy, and mobility
system design. Traditional activity-based models (ABMs), although grounded in
behavioral theories, often rely on simplified rules and assumptions, and are
costly to develop and difficult to adapt across different regions. This paper
presents a learning-based travel demand modeling framework that synthesizes
household-coordinated daily activity patterns based on a household's
socio-demographic profiles. The whole framework integrates population
synthesis, coordinated activity generation, location assignment, and
large-scale microscopic traffic simulation into a unified system. It is fully
generative, data-driven, scalable, and transferable to other regions. A
full-pipeline implementation is conducted in Los Angeles with a 10 million
population. Comprehensive validation shows that the model closely replicates
real-world mobility patterns and matches the performance of legacy ABMs with
significantly reduced modeling cost and greater scalability. With respect to
the SCAG ABM benchmark, the origin-destination matrix achieves a cosine
similarity of 0.97, and the daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network
yields a 0.006 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) and a 9.8% mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE). When compared to real-world observations from Caltrans
PeMS, the evaluation on corridor-level traffic speed and volume reaches a 0.001
JSD and a 6.11% MAPE.

Motivation: 传统基于神经网络的语义编码和解码需要联合训练，而CLIP模型无需训练即可提取语义信息，同时无线噪声和资源限制影响语义通信性能，需联合优化。

Method: 设计基于CLIP模型的语义通信框架，利用PPO强化学习算法优化CLIP模型架构和频谱资源分配，以应对无线噪声和资源限制。

Conclusion: 基于CLIP模型的语义通信框架和强化学习优化方法显著提升了语义通信的性能和效率。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model
based semantic communication framework is designed. Compared to standard neural
network (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and
decoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model
based method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a
transmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural
network model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for
follow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter.
Next, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework
over a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the
CLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic
information transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP
model architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize
semantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay
and energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a
proximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
to learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus
finding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user. Simulation results show that
our proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 40%, and the
accumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.

Motivation: 现有AI模型在EEG识别脑活动时存在评分者间差异、资源限制和泛化性差的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发并验证了VIPEEGNet模型，使用来自1950名患者的106,800个EEG片段进行训练，并在独立数据集上测试。

Conclusion: VIPEEGNet是一种高效且准确的EEG分析工具，有望在脑疾病诊断和治疗中广泛应用。

Abstract: Timely identification of harmful brain activities via electroencephalography
(EEG) is critical for brain disease diagnosis and treatment, which remains
limited application due to inter-rater variability, resource constraints, and
poor generalizability of existing artificial intelligence (AI) models. In this
study, a convolutional neural network model, VIPEEGNet, was developed and
validated using EEGs recorded from Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard
Medical School. The VIPEEGNet was developed and validated using two independent
datasets, collected between 2006 and 2020. The development cohort included EEG
recordings from 1950 patients, with 106,800 EEG segments annotated by at least
one experts (ranging from 1 to 28). The online testing cohort consisted of EEG
segments from a subset of an additional 1,532 patients, each annotated by at
least 10 experts. For the development cohort (n=1950), the VIPEEGNet achieved
high accuracy, with an AUROC for binary classification of seizure, LPD, GPD,
LRDA, GRDA, and "other" categories at 0.972 (95% CI, 0.957-0.988), 0.962 (95%
CI, 0.954-0.970), 0.972 (95% CI, 0.960-0.984), 0.938 (95% CI, 0.917-0.959),
0.949 (95% CI, 0.941-0.957), and 0.930 (95% CI, 0.926-0.935). For multi
classification, the sensitivity of VIPEEGNET for the six categories ranges from
36.8% to 88.2% and the precision ranges from 55.6% to 80.4%, and performance
similar to human experts. Notably, the external validation showed
Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)of 0.223 and 0.273, ranking top 2 among the
existing 2,767 competing algorithms, while we only used 2.8% of the parameters
of the first-ranked algorithm.

Conclusion: 行为探索方法能够有效提升自主代理的在线探索和适应能力，接近人类水平。

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents that quickly explore an environment and adapt
their behavior online is a canonical challenge in robotics and machine
learning. While humans are able to achieve such fast online exploration and
adaptation, often acquiring new information and skills in only a handful of
interactions, existing algorithmic approaches tend to rely on random
exploration and slow, gradient-based behavior updates. How can we endow
autonomous agents with such capabilities on par with humans? Taking inspiration
from recent progress on both in-context learning and large-scale behavioral
cloning, in this work we propose behavioral exploration: training agents to
internalize what it means to explore and adapt in-context over the space of
``expert'' behaviors. To achieve this, given access to a dataset of expert
demonstrations, we train a long-context generative model to predict expert
actions conditioned on a context of past observations and a measure of how
``exploratory'' the expert's behaviors are relative to this context. This
enables the model to not only mimic the behavior of an expert, but also, by
feeding its past history of interactions into its context, to select different
expert behaviors than what have been previously selected, thereby allowing for
fast online adaptation and targeted, ``expert-like'' exploration. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both simulated locomotion and
manipulation settings, as well as on real-world robotic manipulation tasks,
illustrating its ability to learn adaptive, exploratory behavior.

Motivation: LLM函数调用的高延迟影响用户体验，需要一种高效且自动化的加速方法。

Method: 利用生产流量中的“简单查询”，通过知识蒸馏将大模型的知识迁移到小模型，实现加速。

Result: 响应延迟降低45%（预期）和78%（中位数），小模型成功处理60%的流量且准确性损失可忽略。

Conclusion: ODIA是一种实用且自动化的解决方案，适用于生产环境，能持续优化。

Abstract: Function Calling is a crucial technique that enables Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems through APIs. However, the high
latency associated with LLM-based Function Calling significantly impacts user
experience. This paper presents a novel approach called Oriented Distillation
for Inline Acceleration (ODIA) that leverages online user interaction data to
accelerate Function Calling. By automatically identifying "simple queries" from
production traffic and distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller ones,
our method reduces response latency by 45% (expected) and 78% (median) while
maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
real-world deployment in a music application, where the smaller model
successfully handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss. Our method
requires minimal human intervention and continuously improves through automated
data collection and model updating, making it a practical solution for
production environments.

<details>

Motivation: 模仿学习在离散设置中已取得巨大成功，但在物理设置（如自动驾驶和机器人学习）中由于误差累积问题更为复杂，需要更先进的策略或数据增强方法。

Method: 提出了两种干预措施：对于开环稳定系统，采用动作分块（预测并执行动作序列）；对于可能不稳定的系统，采用噪声注入（在专家演示中添加噪声）。

Result: 这些干预措施与机器人学习中的流行选择一致，但其效果与设计初衷不同，且结合了控制理论和强化学习的工具与见解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了单独考虑控制理论或强化学习时未自然出现的新考量，为连续状态和动作模仿学习提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a continuous
state-and-action dynamical system. While imitation learning in discrete
settings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and
popularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous
driving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the
compounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform
stably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential
compounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled
trajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or
data augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably
mitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning.
When the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe "action chunking," i.e.,
predicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is
possibly unstable, we prescribe "noise injection," i.e., adding noise during
expert demonstrations. These interventions align with popular choices in modern
robot learning, though the benefits we derive are distinct from the effects
they were designed to target. Our results draw insights and tools from both
control theory and reinforcement learning; however, our analysis reveals novel
considerations that do not naturally arise when either literature is considered
in isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMC虽是不确定性估计的金标准，但其计算成本限制了其在大规模数据和大型DNN架构中的应用。LL-HMC通过仅对DNN的最后一层进行HMC采样，降低了计算需求。

Method: LL-HMC将HMC采样限制在DNN的最后一层，并与五种最后一层概率深度学习方法（LL-PDL）在三个真实视频数据集上进行比较，评估分类性能、校准性和分布外（OOD）检测能力。

Result: LL-HMC在分类和OOD检测上表现优异，但额外的采样参数未提升分类性能，仅改善了OOD检测。多链或不同起始位置未带来一致改进。

Conclusion: LL-HMC在计算效率和性能之间取得了平衡，适用于资源有限的场景，尤其是在OOD检测方面表现突出。

Abstract: We explore the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling as a
probabilistic last layer approach for deep neural networks (DNNs). While HMC is
widely regarded as a gold standard for uncertainty estimation, the
computational demands limit its application to large-scale datasets and large
DNN architectures. Although the predictions from the sampled DNN parameters can
be parallelized, the computational cost still scales linearly with the number
of samples (similar to an ensemble). Last layer HMC (LL--HMC) reduces the
required computations by restricting the HMC sampling to the final layer of a
DNN, making it applicable to more data-intensive scenarios with limited
computational resources. In this paper, we compare LL-HMC against five last
layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods across three real-world
video datasets for driver action and intention. We evaluate the in-distribution
classification performance, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. Due to the stochastic nature of the probabilistic evaluations, we
performed five grid searches for different random seeds to avoid being reliant
on a single initialization for the hyperparameter configurations. The results
show that LL--HMC achieves competitive in-distribution classification and OOD
detection performance. Additional sampled last layer parameters do not improve
the classification performance, but can improve the OOD detection. Multiple
chains or starting positions did not yield consistent improvements.

Motivation: 深度伪造检测方法在预测性能上表现优异，但存在对种族和性别等人口属性的偏见，威胁公共信任。

Method: 通过重新加权训练模型的最后一层输入，优先处理低变异性输入，降低高变异性输入的影响。

Result: 实验显示，Fair-FLIP将公平性指标提升30%，同时仅降低基线准确率0.25%。

Conclusion: Fair-FLIP是一种有效的后处理方法，能在保持检测性能的同时显著减少偏见。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-generated content has become increasingly popular,
yet its malicious use, particularly the deepfakes, poses a serious threat to
public trust and discourse. While deepfake detection methods achieve high
predictive performance, they often exhibit biases across demographic attributes
such as ethnicity and gender. In this work, we tackle the challenge of fair
deepfake detection, aiming to mitigate these biases while maintaining robust
detection capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel post-processing
approach, referred to as Fairness-Oriented Final Layer Input Prioritising
(Fair-FLIP), that reweights a trained model's final-layer inputs to reduce
subgroup disparities, prioritising those with low variability while demoting
highly variable ones. Experimental results comparing Fair-FLIP to both the
baseline (without fairness-oriented de-biasing) and state-of-the-art approaches
show that Fair-FLIP can enhance fairness metrics by up to 30% while maintaining
baseline accuracy, with only a negligible reduction of 0.25%.

Conclusion: 本文扩展了随机洗牌型梯度方法的适用范围，为更广泛的机器学习模型提供了理论支持，同时保持了高效性能。

Abstract: Shuffling-type gradient methods are favored in practice for their simplicity
and rapid empirical performance. Despite extensive development of convergence
guarantees under various assumptions in recent years, most require the
Lipschitz smoothness condition, which is often not met in common machine
learning models. We highlight this issue with specific counterexamples. To
address this gap, we revisit the convergence rates of shuffling-type gradient
methods without assuming Lipschitz smoothness. Using our stepsize strategy, the
shuffling-type gradient algorithm not only converges under weaker assumptions
but also match the current best-known convergence rates, thereby broadening its
applicability. We prove the convergence rates for nonconvex, strongly convex,
and non-strongly convex cases, each under both random reshuffling and arbitrary
shuffling schemes, under a general bounded variance condition. Numerical
experiments further validate the performance of our shuffling-type gradient
algorithm, underscoring its practical efficacy.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖于分数的估计，而本文探索了一种替代方法，即通过反向离散化和近端映射来改进采样效率和准确性。

Method: 利用近端匹配技术学习对数密度的近端算子，开发了Proximal Diffusion Models（ProxDM）。

Result: 理论证明ProxDM仅需$\widetilde{O}(d/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$步即可生成KL散度$\varepsilon$-准确的分布；实验显示其收敛速度显著快于传统分数匹配方法。

Conclusion: ProxDM在理论和实践上均优于传统方法，为高效生成高维数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly become some of the most popular and powerful
generative models for high-dimensional data. The key insight that enabled their
development was the realization that access to the score -- the gradient of the
log-density at different noise levels -- allows for sampling from data
distributions by solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
via forward discretization, and that popular denoisers allow for unbiased
estimators of this score. In this paper, we demonstrate that an alternative,
backward discretization of these SDEs, using proximal maps in place of the
score, leads to theoretical and practical benefits. We leverage recent results
in proximal matching to learn proximal operators of the log-density and, with
them, develop Proximal Diffusion Models (ProxDM). Theoretically, we prove that
$\widetilde{O}(d/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps suffice for the resulting
discretization to generate an $\varepsilon$-accurate distribution w.r.t. the KL
divergence. Empirically, we show that two variants of ProxDM achieve
significantly faster convergence within just a few sampling steps compared to
conventional score-matching methods.

Motivation: 提升跨平台广告推荐的准确性，捕捉用户兴趣迁移的潜在路径。

Method: 利用用户行为数据、广告内容和平台特征进行多维度建模，通过GNN捕捉兴趣迁移。

Result: 在三个平台数据集上测试，Platform B的AUC值达到0.937，表现最佳；其他平台因广告标签分布不均略有下降。

Conclusion: 通过调整超参数，模型在异构数据中的适应性和鲁棒性得到进一步改善。

Abstract: In order to improve the accuracy of cross-platform advertisement
recommendation, a graph neural network (GNN)- based advertisement
recommendation method is analyzed. Through multi-dimensional modeling, user
behavior data (e.g., click frequency, active duration) reveal temporal patterns
of interest evolution, ad content (e.g., type, tag, duration) influences
semantic preferences, and platform features (e.g., device type, usage context)
shape the environment where interest transitions occur. These factors jointly
enable the GNN to capture the latent pathways of user interest migration across
platforms. The experimental results are based on the datasets of three
platforms, and Platform B reaches 0.937 in AUC value, which is the best
performance. Platform A and Platform C showed a slight decrease in precision
and recall with uneven distribution of ad labels. By adjusting the
hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size and embedding dimension, the
adaptability and robustness of the model in heterogeneous data are further
improved.

TL;DR: 论文分析了离散扩散模型中无分类器引导（CFG）的作用，发现早期高强度引导会降低生成质量，而后期引导效果更显著。提出了改进方法，通过简单代码调整提升样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究离散扩散模型中CFG的引导调度对生成质量的影响，并解决现有实现中的不平衡过渡问题。

Method: 理论分析CFG在掩码离散扩散中的作用，提出一种新的引导机制，平滑数据分布与初始分布之间的过渡。

Result: 实验证明改进方法在ImageNet和QM9数据集上有效提升了样本质量。

Conclusion: 早期高强度引导有害，后期引导更有效；改进方法简单且有效，适用于任何离散扩散模型。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for conditional
generation and improving sample quality in continuous diffusion models, and
recent works have extended it to discrete diffusion. This paper theoretically
analyzes CFG in the context of masked discrete diffusion, focusing on the role
of guidance schedules. Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling
(when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage
guidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation
for empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The
analysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations. These
implementations can unintentionally cause imbalanced transitions, such as
unmasking too rapidly during the early stages of generation, which degrades the
quality of the resulting samples. To address this, we draw insight from the
analysis and propose a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism empirically
applicable to any discrete diffusion. Intuitively, our method smoothens the
transport between the data distribution and the initial (masked/uniform)
distribution, which results in improved sample quality. Remarkably, our method
is achievable via a simple one-line code change. The efficacy of our method is
empirically demonstrated with experiments on ImageNet (masked discrete
diffusion) and QM9 (uniform discrete diffusion).

Motivation: 解决机器学习在蛋白质-配体结合亲和力预测中数据不足的问题，同时弥补物理方法计算成本高的缺陷。

Method: 引入ToxBench数据集，并使用双损失框架的DualBind模型学习结合能函数。

Result: DualBind模型表现优异，机器学习能以较低计算成本近似AB-FEP。

Conclusion: ToxBench和DualBind为药物发现提供了高效工具，展示了机器学习在结合亲和力预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is essential for drug discovery
and toxicity assessment. While machine learning (ML) promises fast and accurate
predictions, its progress is constrained by the availability of reliable data.
In contrast, physics-based methods such as absolute binding free energy
perturbation (AB-FEP) deliver high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive
for high-throughput applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench,
the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on
a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha
(ER$\alpha$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$\alpha$-ligand complex structures with
binding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against
experimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping
ligand splits to assess model generalizability. Using ToxBench, we further
benchmark state-of-the-art ML methods, and notably, our proposed DualBind
model, which employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding
energy function. The benchmark results demonstrate the superior performance of
DualBind and the potential of ML to approximate AB-FEP at a fraction of the
computational cost.

Abstract: Deep learning models incorporating linear SSMs have gained attention for

parameter sizes pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
In this study, we propose an efficient parameter reduction method for these
models by applying $H^{2}$ model order reduction techniques from control theory
to their linear SSM components. In experiments, the LRA benchmark results show
that the model compression based on our proposed method outperforms an existing
method using the Balanced Truncation, while successfully reducing the number of
parameters in the SSMs to $1/32$ without sacrificing the performance of the
original models.

Result: PINNs准确再现了湍流的关键统计量，如能量谱、动能、涡度和雷诺应力。

Conclusion: 神经方程求解器能处理复杂混沌系统，为超越传统计算限制的湍流建模开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems
in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive
at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a
radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical
equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free
solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully
simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly
learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional
computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic
innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and
advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning
chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence
problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics
including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our
results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic
systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that
transcends traditional computational limitations.

Conclusion: SGNNs将科学理论与深度学习结合，开创了新的建模范式，提供了灵活、鲁棒且可解释的推断能力。

Abstract: Scientific modeling faces a core limitation: mechanistic models offer
interpretability but collapse under real-world complexity, while machine
learning models are flexible but require large labeled datasets, cannot infer
unobservable quantities, and operate as black boxes. We introduce
Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), a general framework that uses
mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are
pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter
regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. We evaluated SGNNs across
scientific disciplines and modeling tasks, and found that SGNNs achieved
state-of-the-art results across settings: for prediction tasks, they nearly
tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield
prediction error by one third, and maintained accuracy in ecological
forecasting where task specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also
accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social
networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as
estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods
even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution,
a new form of mechanistic interpretability. Given real world input, SGNNs
retrieve simulations based on what the model has learned to see as most
similar, revealing which underlying dynamics the model believes are active.
This provides process-level insight -- what the model thinks is happening --
not just which features mattered. SGNNs unify scientific theory with deep
learning flexibility and unlock a new modeling paradigm -- transforming
simulations from rigid, post hoc tools into flexible sources of supervision,
enabling robust, interpretable inference even when ground truth is missing.

Conclusion: 表示引导显著提升扩散模型的生成效率和训练速度，为未来研究提供了系统性框架。

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more
effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already
shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those
of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a
systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion
models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with
their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and
how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical
insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation
alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target
representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different
synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal
pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances
representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image,
protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior
performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the
class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in
$23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times
speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA. The code is available at

Abstract: While poisoning attacks on machine learning models have been extensively
studied, the mechanisms by which adversaries can distribute poisoned models at
scale remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we shed light on how model
leaderboards -- ranked platforms for model discovery and evaluation -- can
serve as a powerful channel for adversaries for stealthy large-scale
distribution of poisoned models. We present TrojanClimb, a general framework
that enables injection of malicious behaviors while maintaining competitive
leaderboard performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across four diverse
modalities: text-embedding, text-generation, text-to-speech and text-to-image,
showing that adversaries can successfully achieve high leaderboard rankings
while embedding arbitrary harmful functionalities, from backdoors to bias
injection. Our findings reveal a significant vulnerability in the machine
learning ecosystem, highlighting the urgent need to redesign leaderboard
evaluation mechanisms to detect and filter malicious (e.g., poisoned) models,
while exposing broader security implications for the machine learning community
regarding the risks of adopting models from unverified sources.

Abstract: Methods: We developed a self-supervised deep learning model that extracts
meaningful patterns from multi-modal signals (Electroencephalography (EEG),
Electrocardiography (ECG), and respiratory signals). The model was trained on
data from 4,398 participants. Projection scores were derived by contrasting
embeddings from individuals with and without CVD outcomes. External validation
was conducted in an independent cohort with 1,093 participants. The source code
is available on https://github.com/miraclehetech/sleep-ssl. Results: The
projection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across
modalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident
cardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were
predictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals
added complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with
the Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance,
achieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across
different outcomes. Findings were robustly replicated and validated in the
external testing cohort. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the proposed
framework can generate individualized CVD risk scores directly from PSG data.
The resulting projection scores have the potential to be integrated into
clinical practice, enhancing risk assessment and supporting personalized care.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns language models with

that leverage human gaze modeling to enhance RLHF: (1) gaze-aware reward models
and (2) gaze-based distribution of sparse rewards at token level. Our
experiments demonstate that gaze-informed RLHF achieves faster convergence
while maintaining or slightly improving performance, thus, reducing
computational costs during policy optimization. These results show that human
gaze provides a valuable and underused signal for policy optimization, pointing
to a promising direction for improving RLHF efficiency.

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM推理系统的评估方法奠定了严谨基础，促进了可重复和有意义的比较。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems has
yielded significant efficiency improvements. However, our systematic analysis
reveals that current evaluation methodologies frequently exhibit fundamental
flaws, often manifesting as common evaluation anti-patterns that obscure true
performance characteristics and impede scientific progress. Through a
comprehensive examination of recent systems, we identify recurring
anti-patterns across three key dimensions: Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup,
and Metric Design. These anti-patterns are uniquely problematic for LLM
inference due to its dual-phase nature combining distinct prefill and decode
operations, its handling of highly heterogeneous workloads, and its strict
temporal requirements for interactive use. We demonstrate how common
anti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate
engineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to
represent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial
performance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions.
To address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from
our analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these
anti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation. To demonstrate the
practical application of our framework, we present a case study analyzing
speculative decoding, a technique whose bursty, non-uniform token generation is
easily misinterpreted when evaluated using approaches characteristic of these
anti-patterns. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for evaluation
methodology, enabling meaningful comparisons, ensuring reproducible results,
and ultimately accelerating genuine progress in LLM inference systems by moving
beyond common anti-patterns to align evaluation with real-world requirements.

Result: 随机块丢弃技术表现优于宽度子网络构建，内存使用减少20-40%且性能不降。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少内存需求的同时保持了性能，具有潜力。

Abstract: Distributed pre-training of large models at scale often imposes heavy memory
demands on individual nodes and incurs significant intra-node communication
costs. We propose a novel alternative approach that reduces the memory
requirements by training small, structured subnetworks of the model on separate
workers. Unlike pipelining, our method avoids inter-node activation
communication and maintains bandwidth requirements that are comparable to or
lower than standard data parallel communication schemes based on all-reduce. We
evaluate two subnetwork construction strategies guided by the principle of
ensuring uniform representation of each parameter across the distributed
training setup. Our results show that the stochastic block dropping technique
consistently outperforms the width-wise subnetwork construction previously
explored in federated learning. We empirically attribute this superior
performance to stronger gradient alignment in subnetworks that retain blocks
having skip connections. Preliminary experiments highlight the promise of our
approach, achieving a 20-40% reduction in memory usage without any loss in
performance.

Result: 实验表明，R-MDN在静态学习和持续学习中均能减少混杂变量影响，提升预测公平性。

Conclusion: R-MDN是一种有效的解决方案，可集成到任何深度学习架构中，应对持续学习中的混杂变量问题。

Abstract: Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the
target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are
recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models,
such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned
features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of
continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time
without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to
confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from
intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN)
layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including
vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical
regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and
continually update an internal model state with respect to changing
distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate
that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within
static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing
catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持训练粒度和推理保真度的同时，大幅提高了生成效率。

Abstract: Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by
reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with
Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the
high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve
hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we
introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that
improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or
inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the
noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a
Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which
the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining
generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike
existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping
steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while
avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like'
distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate
substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Flight delays are a significant challenge in the aviation industry, causing
major financial and operational disruptions. To improve passenger experience
and reduce revenue loss, flight delay prediction models must be both precise
and generalizable across different networks. This paper introduces a novel
approach that combines Queue-Theory with a simple attention model, referred to
as the Queue-Theory SimAM (QT-SimAM). To validate our model, we used data from
the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, where our proposed QT-SimAM
(Bidirectional) model outperformed existing methods with an accuracy of 0.927
and an F1 score of 0.932. To assess transferability, we tested the model on the
EUROCONTROL dataset. The results demonstrated strong performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.826 and an F1 score of 0.791. Ultimately, this paper outlines an
effective, end-to-end methodology for predicting flight delays. The proposed
model's ability to forecast delays with high accuracy across different networks
can help reduce passenger anxiety and improve operational decision-making

Conclusion: 多步信用分配的GPBE扩展方法显著提升了深度RL的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Achieving fast and stable off-policy learning in deep reinforcement learning
(RL) is challenging. Most existing methods rely on semi-gradient
temporal-difference (TD) methods for their simplicity and efficiency, but are
consequently susceptible to divergence. While more principled approaches like
Gradient TD (GTD) methods have strong convergence guarantees, they have rarely
been used in deep RL. Recent work introduced the Generalized Projected Bellman
Error ($\GPBE$), enabling GTD methods to work efficiently with nonlinear
function approximation. However, this work is only limited to one-step methods,
which are slow at credit assignment and require a large number of samples. In
this paper, we extend the $\GPBE$ objective to support multistep credit
assignment based on the $\lambda$-return and derive three gradient-based
methods that optimize this new objective. We provide both a forward-view
formulation compatible with experience replay and a backward-view formulation
compatible with streaming algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed
algorithms and show that they outperform both PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and
MinAtar environments, respectively. Code available at

Abstract: We generalize the low-rank decomposition problem, such as principal and
independent component analysis (PCA, ICA) for continuous-time vector-valued
signals and provide a model-agnostic implicit neural signal representation
framework to learn numerical approximations to solve the problem. Modeling
signals as continuous-time stochastic processes, we unify the approaches to
both the PCA and ICA problems in the continuous setting through a contrast
function term in the network loss, enforcing the desired statistical properties
of the source signals (decorrelation, independence) learned in the
decomposition. This extension to a continuous domain allows the application of
such decompositions to point clouds and irregularly sampled signals where
standard techniques are not applicable.

TL;DR: 论文提出DejaVu攻击，利用网络延迟导致多模态传感器时间错位，显著降低感知性能，并提出防御方法AION。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合（MMF）在自动驾驶中至关重要，但其严格的时间同步要求使其易受攻击。

Method: 提出DejaVu攻击，通过延迟传感器数据流制造时间错位；提出AION防御，通过跨模态时间一致性监测攻击。

Result: 攻击显著降低感知性能（如目标检测mAP下降88.5%）；AION防御表现优异（AUROC 0.92-0.98）。

Conclusion: DejaVu攻击揭示了MMF的脆弱性，AION为时间错位攻击提供了有效防御。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous
driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and
efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal
synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle
temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream
MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different
models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced
sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while
object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a
single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to
88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy
(MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense
patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal
alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal
shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path
of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our
thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with
low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it
as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于集合转换器的多任务学习框架S2SRec2，用于解决电商购物篮中多食材推荐问题，显著优于传统单目标方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统食谱补全方法仅预测单一缺失食材，无法满足实际需求中多食材推荐及食材间关系的考虑。

Method: 将购物篮补全问题重新定义为集合到集合（S2S）推荐问题，采用基于Set Transformer的多任务学习框架S2SRec2，同时学习缺失食材检索和购物篮完整性评估。

Result: 在大规模食谱数据集上的实验表明，S2SRec2显著优于单目标基线方法。

Conclusion: S2SRec2为提升电商购物体验和激发烹饪创意提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In grocery e-commerce, customers often build ingredient baskets guided by
dietary preferences but lack the expertise to create complete meals. Leveraging
recipe knowledge to recommend complementary ingredients based on a partial
basket is essential for improving the culinary experience. Traditional recipe
completion methods typically predict a single missing ingredient using a
leave-one-out strategy. However, they fall short in two key aspects: (i) they
do not reflect real-world scenarios where multiple ingredients are often
needed, and (ii) they overlook relationships among the missing ingredients
themselves. To address these limitations, we reformulate basket completion as a
set-to-set (S2S) recommendation problem, where an incomplete basket is input
into a system that predicts a set of complementary ingredients. We introduce
S2SRec2, a set-to-set ingredient recommendation framework based on a Set
Transformer and trained in a multitask learning paradigm. S2SRec2 jointly
learns to (i) retrieve missing ingredients from the representation of existing
ones and (ii) assess basket completeness after prediction. These tasks are
optimized together, enforcing accurate retrieval and coherent basket
completion. Experiments on large-scale recipe datasets and qualitative analyses
show that S2SRec2 significantly outperforms single-target baselines, offering a
promising approach to enhance grocery shopping and inspire culinary creativity.

Motivation: 研究特征选项是否能在模型无关强化学习中加速信用分配，并探索其在深度强化学习中的应用。

Method: 在表格和像素网格世界中进行实验，评估特征选项的表现，并提出一种在非线性函数逼近下学习选项值的方法。

Result: 预定义特征选项有助于信用分配和探索，而在线发现可能因偏置经验而阻碍学习。

Conclusion: 特征选项在信用分配和探索中具有潜力，但需注意其复杂性，尤其是在深度强化学习中。

Abstract: Options, which impose an inductive bias toward temporal and hierarchical
structure, offer a powerful framework for reinforcement learning (RL). While
effective in sequential decision-making, they are often handcrafted rather than
learned. Among approaches for discovering options, eigenoptions have shown
strong performance in exploration, but their role in credit assignment remains
underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether eigenoptions can
accelerate credit assignment in model-free RL, evaluating them in tabular and
pixel-based gridworlds. We find that pre-specified eigenoptions aid not only
exploration but also credit assignment, whereas online discovery can bias the
agent's experience too strongly and hinder learning. In the context of deep RL,
we also propose a method for learning option-values under non-linear function
approximation, highlighting the impact of termination conditions on
performance. Our findings reveal both the promise and complexity of using
eigenoptions, and options more broadly, to simultaneously support credit
assignment and exploration in reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合图提示与权重剪枝的新框架GPAWP，旨在通过减少提示数量提升图神经网络的性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）在训练和推理时间、复杂关系捕捉及特征提取方面存在不足，而现有研究忽视了图提示在优化模型中的潜力及其对稳定性和效率的影响。

Method: 提出GPAWP框架，结合图提示与权重剪枝，通过重要性评估函数确定不同粒度的正负权重，并采用分层剪枝去除负提示标签。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，GPAWP显著减少了节点分类任务中的参数数量，同时保持了竞争力。

Conclusion: GPAWP通过优化图提示和剪枝策略，有效提升了GNNs的性能与效率。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
graph-based tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction). Despite their
triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times,
difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature
extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods
have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale
datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential
improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the
potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both
positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with
weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and
efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance
of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive
and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically
structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more
parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a
significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.

TL;DR: POIFormer是一种基于Transformer的新框架，用于准确高效地将用户访问归因于特定POI，解决了GPS不准确和POI空间密度高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GPS精度问题（2-20米误差）和城市环境中POI的高密度分布，传统的基于邻近性的POI归因方法效果不佳，需要更先进的解决方案。

Method: POIFormer利用Transformer的自注意力机制，综合建模空间邻近性、访问时间与时长、POI语义上下文以及用户和群体行为模式。

Result: 在真实世界移动数据集上的实验表明，POIFormer显著优于现有基线方法，尤其在空间噪声和高密度POI聚类场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: POIFormer提供了一种高效、通用的POI归因方法，适用于多种数据源和地理环境，具有实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Accurately attributing user visits to specific Points of Interest (POIs) is a
foundational task for mobility analytics, personalized services, marketing and
urban planning. However, POI attribution remains challenging due to GPS
inaccuracies, typically ranging from 2 to 20 meters in real-world settings, and
the high spatial density of POIs in urban environments, where multiple venues
can coexist within a small radius (e.g., over 50 POIs within a 100-meter radius
in dense city centers). Relying on proximity is therefore often insufficient
for determining which POI was actually visited. We introduce
\textsf{POIFormer}, a novel Transformer-based framework for accurate and
efficient POI attribution. Unlike prior approaches that rely on limited
spatiotemporal, contextual, or behavioral features, \textsf{POIFormer} jointly
models a rich set of signals, including spatial proximity, visit timing and
duration, contextual features from POI semantics, and behavioral features from
user mobility and aggregated crowd behavior patterns--using the Transformer's
self-attention mechanism to jointly model complex interactions across these
dimensions. By leveraging the Transformer to model a user's past and future
visits (with the current visit masked) and incorporating crowd-level behavioral
patterns through pre-computed KDEs, \textsf{POIFormer} enables accurate,
efficient attribution in large, noisy mobility datasets. Its architecture
supports generalization across diverse data sources and geographic contexts
while avoiding reliance on hard-to-access or unavailable data layers, making it
practical for real-world deployment. Extensive experiments on real-world
mobility datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines,
particularly in challenging real-world settings characterized by spatial noise
and dense POI clustering.

Motivation: 药物相互作用（DDI）对患者安全和医疗结果有重大影响，现有方法常忽视药物对的复杂性和上下文依赖性，且难以整合生物网络和分子结构。

Method: MolecBioNet将药物对建模为统一实体，结合宏观生物相互作用和微观分子影响，使用图神经网络学习多尺度表示，并引入两种特定池化策略（CASPool和AGIPool）及互信息最小化正则化。

Conclusion: MolecBioNet提供了一个全面且可解释的DDI预测框架，通过统一建模和多尺度整合显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology,
often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for
patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved
strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently,
overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs.
Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction
networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic
insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework
that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable
DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet
captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular
influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework
extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs
hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging
classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of
drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces
two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling
(CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and
attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential
molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information
minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and
embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair
modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.

Motivation: 持续强化学习中，代理在学习新任务时可能遗忘旧任务（灾难性遗忘），本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用在线学习的Follow-The-Leader浅层模型捕捉世界动态，结合模型预测控制规划任务。

Result: 在线世界模型具有抗遗忘性，实验表明该方法在持续学习基准上优于基于深度世界模型的基线。

Conclusion: 提出的FTL在线代理（OA）能持续学习新任务且不遗忘旧技能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) refers to a naturalistic setting where
an agent needs to endlessly evolve, by trial and error, to solve multiple tasks
that are presented sequentially. One of the largest obstacles to CRL is that
the agent may forget how to solve previous tasks when learning a new task,
known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose to address this
challenge by planning with online world models. Specifically, we learn a
Follow-The-Leader shallow model online to capture the world dynamics, in which
we plan using model predictive control to solve a set of tasks specified by any
reward functions. The online world model is immune to forgetting by
construction with a proven regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K^2D\log(T)})$
under mild assumptions. The planner searches actions solely based on the latest
online model, thus forming a FTL Online Agent (OA) that updates incrementally.
To assess OA, we further design Continual Bench, a dedicated environment for
CRL, and compare with several strong baselines under the same model-planning
algorithmic framework. The empirical results show that OA learns continuously
to solve new tasks while not forgetting old skills, outperforming agents built
on deep world models with various continual learning techniques.

Conclusion: XiChen展示了完全由AI驱动的天气预报系统的潜力，有望摆脱对数值天气预报系统的依赖。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) demonstrate significant
potential to revolutionize weather forecasting. However, most AI-driven models
rely on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems for initial condition
preparation, which often consumes hours on supercomputers. Here we introduce
XiChen, the first observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather
forecasting system, whose entire pipeline, from Data Assimilation (DA) to
medium-range forecasting, can be accomplished within only 17 seconds. XiChen is
built upon a foundation model that is pre-trained for weather forecasting.
Meanwhile, this model is subsequently fine-tuned to serve as both observation
operators and DA models, thereby scalably assimilating conventional and raw
satellite observations. Furthermore, the integration of four-dimensional
variational knowledge ensures that XiChen's DA and medium-range forecasting
accuracy rivals that of operational NWP systems, amazingly achieving a skillful
forecasting lead time exceeding 8.25 days. These findings demonstrate that
XiChen holds strong potential toward fully AI-driven weather forecasting
independent of NWP systems.

Motivation: 现有气候极端事件记录不完整，且忽视空间依赖性，低估了同步灾害的风险。

Method: 开发DeepX-GAN模型，结合知识引导的深度生成方法，捕捉罕见极端事件的空间结构。

Result: 模型成功模拟了超出历史经验的极端事件，揭示了脆弱地区的潜在风险。

Conclusion: 未来气候变暖可能改变极端事件分布，需制定空间适应性政策以应对新兴风险热点。

Abstract: Observed records of climate extremes provide an incomplete picture of risk,
missing "unseen" extremes that exceed historical bounds. In parallel,
neglecting spatial dependence undervalues the risk of synchronized hazards that
amplify impacts. To address these challenges, we develop DeepX-GAN
(Dependence-Enhanced Embedding for Physical eXtremes - Generative Adversarial
Network), a knowledge-informed deep generative model designed to better capture
the spatial structure of rare extremes. The zero-shot generalizability of
DeepX-GAN enables simulation of unseen extremes that fall outside historical
experience yet remain statistically plausible. We define two types of unseen
extremes: "checkmate" extremes that directly hit targets, and "stalemate"
extremes that narrowly miss. These unrealized scenarios expose latent risks in
fragile systems and may reinforce a false sense of resilience if overlooked.
Near misses, in particular, can prompt either proactive adaptation or dangerous
complacency, depending on how they are interpreted. Applying DeepX-GAN to the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA), we find that these unseen extremes
disproportionately affect regions with high vulnerability and low socioeconomic
readiness, but differ in urgency and interpretation. Future warming could
expand and redistribute these unseen extremes, with emerging exposure hotspots
in Indo-Pakistan and Central Africa. This distributional shift highlights
critical blind spots in conventional hazard planning and underscores the need
to develop spatially adaptive policies that anticipate emergent risk hotspots
rather than simply extrapolating from historical patterns.

Result: 在Cornell和Jacquard数据集上，性能比传统联邦学习提升8%。

Conclusion: MTF-Grasp有效解决了非独立同分布数据问题，提升了机器人抓取任务的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning paradigm that enables
participating devices to train privacy-preserved and collaborative models. FL
has proven its benefits for robotic manipulation tasks. However, grasping tasks
lack exploration in such settings where robots train a global model without
moving data and ensuring data privacy. The main challenge is that each robot
learns from data that is nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID)
and of low quantity. This exhibits performance degradation, particularly in
robotic grasping. Thus, in this work, we propose MTF-Grasp, a multi-tier FL
approach for robotic grasping, acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the
non-IID data distribution across robots, including quantitative skewness.
MTF-Grasp harnesses data quality and quantity across robots to select a set of
"top-level" robots with better data distribution and higher sample count. It
then utilizes top-level robots to train initial seed models and distribute them
to the remaining "low-level" robots, reducing the risk of model performance
degradation in low-level robots. Our approach outperforms the conventional FL
setup by up to 8% on the quantity-skewed Cornell and Jacquard grasping
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的迭代生成模型（如扩散模型和流匹配）生成高保真样本需要大量计算步骤，速度较慢。

Method: 引入warm-start模型，通过预测一个条件化的先验分布N(mu, sigma)作为起始点，减少生成过程的距离。

Result: 在图像修复等任务中，仅需11次函数评估即可达到与1000步DDPM基线相当的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法简单且兼容现有生成模型，无需修改即可与其他高效采样技术结合，进一步加速生成。

Abstract: Iterative generative models, like diffusion and flow-matching, create
high-fidelity samples by progressively refining a noise vector into data.
However, this process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function
evaluations. We introduce the warm-start model, a simple, deterministic model
that dramatically accelerates conditional generation by providing a better
starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed N(0, I)
prior, our warm-start model predicts an informed prior N(mu, sigma), whose
moments are conditioned on the input context. This "warm start" substantially
reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, particularly when
the conditioning information is strongly informative. On tasks like image
inpainting, our method achieves results competitive with a 1000-step DDPM
baseline using only 11 total function evaluations (1 for the warm start, 10 for
generation). A simple conditional normalization trick makes our method
compatible with any standard generative model and sampler without modification,
allowing it to be combined with other efficient sampling techniques for further
acceleration. Our implementation is available at
https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/warm-start-model.

Conclusion: CWNN框架具有广泛的应用性和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Wavelet neural network (WNN), which learns an unknown nonlinear mapping from
the data, has been widely used in signal processing, and time-series analysis.
However, challenges in constructing accurate wavelet bases and high
computational costs limit their application. This study introduces a
constructive WNN that selects initial bases and trains functions by introducing
new bases for predefined accuracy while reducing computational costs. For the
first time, we analyze the frequency of unknown nonlinear functions and select
appropriate initial wavelets based on their primary frequency components by
estimating the energy of the spatial frequency component. This leads to a novel
constructive framework consisting of a frequency estimator and a wavelet-basis
increase mechanism to prioritize high-energy bases, significantly improving
computational efficiency. The theoretical foundation defines the necessary
time-frequency range for high-dimensional wavelets at a given accuracy. The
framework's versatility is demonstrated through four examples: estimating
unknown static mappings from offline data, combining two offline datasets,
identifying time-varying mappings from time-series data, and capturing
nonlinear dependencies in real time-series data. These examples showcase the
framework's broad applicability and practicality. All the code will be released
at https://github.com/dshuangdd/CWNN.

Method: 通过识别TPP的细化算法与语言模型推测解码的结构相似性，设计了一个高效的采样框架，使用较小的草稿模型生成候选事件，并由较大的目标模型并行验证。

Result: 实验表明，TPP-SD在保持与自回归采样相同输出分布的同时，实现了2-6倍的加速。

Conclusion: TPP-SD成功地将强大的Transformer TPP模型与实际快速序列采样的需求结合起来。

Abstract: We propose TPP-SD, a novel approach that accelerates Transformer temporal
point process (TPP) sampling by adapting speculative decoding (SD) techniques
from language models. By identifying the structural similarities between
thinning algorithms for TPPs and speculative decoding for language models, we
develop an efficient sampling framework that leverages a smaller draft model to
generate multiple candidate events, which are then verified by the larger
target model in parallel. TPP-SD maintains the same output distribution as
autoregressive sampling while achieving significant acceleration. Experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach produces
samples from identical distributions as standard methods, but with 2-6$\times$
speedup. Our ablation studies analyze the impact of hyperparameters such as
draft length and draft model size on sampling efficiency. TPP-SD bridges the
gap between powerful Transformer TPP models and the practical need for rapid
sequence sampling.

Abstract: Patch-based transformer surrogates have become increasingly effective for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics, but the fixed patch size is a major
limitation for budget-conscience deployment in production. We introduce two
lightweight, architecture-agnostic modules-the Convolutional Kernel Modulator
(CKM) and Convolutional Stride Modulator (CSM)-that enable dynamic patch size
control at inference in patch based models, without retraining or accuracy
loss. Combined with a cyclic patch-size rollout, our method mitigates patch
artifacts and improves long-term stability for video-like prediction tasks.
Applied to a range of challenging 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks, our approach
improves rollout fidelity and runtime efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to enable inference-time patch-size tunability in patch-based
PDE surrogates. Its plug-and-play design makes it broadly applicable across
architectures-establishing a general foundation for compute-adaptive modeling
in PDE surrogate tasks.

Conclusion: 将不确定性纳入时间序列插补具有实际价值，能显著提升数据质量和任务表现。

Abstract: Time series data with missing values is common across many domains.
Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor
disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is
critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack
mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general
framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation.
By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable
imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering
diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing
less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves
downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour
mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating
uncertainty into time series imputation.

Result: 初步定义了MAE并提供了示例，展示了其在机器学习和生物学中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: MAE为动态演化类别的建模提供了新方法，未来研究将进一步探索其应用。

Abstract: An autoencoder (AE) is a neural network that, using self-supervised training,
learns a succinct parameterized representation, and a corresponding encoding
and decoding process, for all instances in a given class. Here, we introduce
the concept of a meta-autoencoder (MAE): an AE for a collection of
autoencoders. Given a family of classes that differ from each other by the
values of some parameters, and a trained AE for each class, an MAE for the
family is a neural net that has learned a compact representation and associated
encoder and decoder for the class-specific AEs. One application of this general
concept is in research and modeling of natural evolution -- capturing the
defining and the distinguishing properties across multiple species that are
dynamically evolving from each other and from common ancestors. In this interim
report we provide a constructive definition of MAEs, initial examples, and the
motivating research directions in machine learning and biology.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlations
between different data modalities and learning low-dimensional representations.
As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention.
However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream
classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA
method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are
independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without
compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world
data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating
its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving
fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in
neuroimaging studies where unbiased analysis is essential.

Abstract: Generative modeling of graphs with spatial structure is essential across many
applications from computer graphics to spatial genomics. Recent flow-based
generative models have achieved impressive results by gradually adding and then
learning to remove noise from these graphs. Existing models, however, use graph
neural network architectures that are independent of the noise level, limiting
their expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce
\textit{Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks} (NCGNs), a class of graph neural
networks that dynamically modify their architecture according to the noise
level during generation. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that as
noise increases, (1) graphs require information from increasingly distant
neighbors and (2) graphs can be effectively represented at lower resolutions.
Based on these insights, we develop Dynamic Message Passing (DMP), a specific
instantiation of NCGNs that adapts both the range and resolution of message
passing to the noise level. DMP consistently outperforms noise-independent
architectures on a variety of domains including $3$D point clouds,
spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and images. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究了多头潜在注意力（MLA）对预训练中Transformer内部容量的影响，发现旋转嵌入的应用方式对防止容量瓶颈至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MLA在压缩键/值记忆时如何影响Transformer的预训练容量，特别是旋转嵌入的应用方式对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用Marchenko-Pastur（MP）诊断分析$W_{Q}W_{K}^\top$矩阵的频谱，比较标准多头注意力（MHA）、MLA-PreRoPE和MLA-Decoupled三种变体。

Result: 发现容量瓶颈在特定层早期出现并传播，导致秩崩溃；只有MLA-Decoupled能避免这一问题，保持频谱支持。

Conclusion: 旋转嵌入的应用方式与压缩位置同样重要，共享旋转分量能防止频谱碎片化并保持模型容量。

Abstract: In this work, we study how multi-head latent attention (MLA), a popular
strategy for compressing key/value memory, affects a transformer's internal
capacity during pretraining. Using a lightweight suite of Marchenko-Pastur (MP)
diagnostics, we analyze the spectrum of the $W_{Q}W_{K}^\top$ gram matrix
throughout training, comparing three variants: the standard multi-head
attention (MHA) baseline, MLA-PreRoPE with rotary applied before compression,
and MLA-Decoupled, which shares a single rotary sub-vector across all heads.
Our random matrix analysis reveals \textbf{three key findings:} \textbf{ i)}
capacity bottlenecks emerge locally: both MHA and MLA-PreRoPE exhibit sharp,
early spikes in specific layers that persist and propagate, disrupting the
balance between bulk and outlier directions; \textbf{ ii)} these spikes
coincide with rank collapse, concentrating the model's expressivity into narrow
subspaces; \textbf{ iii)} only the decoupled variant prevents this cascade,
maintaining broad spectral support and suppressing outlier formation across
layers. These results underscore that \emph{how} rotary embeddings are applied
is just as critical as \emph{where} compression occurs. Sharing rotary
components across heads mitigates spectral fragmentation and preserves
representational capacity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据混合比例选择依赖试错法，在大规模预训练中不切实际，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 利用缩放定律预测模型损失，通过小规模训练估算参数，并外推至大规模和未见数据混合比例。

Result: 在LLM、NMM和LVM三种大规模场景中验证了缩放定律的普适性和预测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据混合比例选择提供了理论依据，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large foundation models are typically trained on data from multiple domains,
with the data mixture--the proportion of each domain used--playing a critical
role in model performance. The standard approach to selecting this mixture
relies on trial and error, which becomes impractical for large-scale
pretraining. We propose a systematic method to determine the optimal data
mixture for any target domain using scaling laws. Our approach accurately
predicts the loss of a model of size $N$ trained with $D$ tokens and a specific
domain weight vector $h$. We validate the universality of these scaling laws by
demonstrating their predictive power in three distinct and large-scale
settings: large language model (LLM), native multimodal model (NMM), and large
vision models (LVM) pretraining. We further show that these scaling laws can
extrapolate to new data mixtures and across scales: their parameters can be
accurately estimated using a few small-scale training runs, and used to
estimate the performance at larger scales and unseen domain weights. The
scaling laws allow to derive the optimal domain weights for any target domain
under a given training budget ($N$,$D$), providing a principled alternative to
costly trial-and-error methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在安全对齐后仍可能表现出隐蔽的欺骗行为，需要一种机制来识别和解决这一问题。

Method: 采用对抗性激活修补框架，通过将欺骗性提示的激活修补到安全前向传递中，模拟漏洞并量化欺骗率。

Result: 实验显示，对抗性修补将欺骗性输出从0%提高到23.9%，并验证了多个假设。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI安全提供了新工具，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent
deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit
critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a
novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching
as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in
transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and
patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate
vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network
simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we
demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from
a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We
propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation
in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review
synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial
attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust
fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research
directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use
potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.

Motivation: 深度学习模型参数数量不断增加，需在资源受限设备上部署，因此需要有效的压缩技术。

Method: 采用信息几何视角分析模型压缩方法，重点关注算子分解，并提出使用信息散度进行投影。同时，研究了迭代奇异值阈值方法在软秩约束下的收敛性。

Result: 研究表明，信息散度在预训练模型压缩中至关重要，但在微调场景下，模型的训练性更为关键。通过软秩减少的简单修改，可在固定压缩率下提升性能。

Conclusion: 信息几何为模型压缩提供了新视角，预训练和微调场景下需采用不同策略，迭代方法在软秩约束下具有潜力。

Abstract: The ever-increasing parameter counts of deep learning models necessitate
effective compression techniques for deployment on resource-constrained
devices. This paper explores the application of information geometry, the study
of density-induced metrics on parameter spaces, to analyze existing methods
within the space of model compression, primarily focusing on operator
factorization. Adopting this perspective highlights the core challenge:
defining an optimal low-compute submanifold (or subset) and projecting onto it.
We argue that many successful model compression approaches can be understood as
implicitly approximating information divergences for this projection. We
highlight that when compressing a pre-trained model, using information
divergences is paramount for achieving improved zero-shot accuracy, yet this
may no longer be the case when the model is fine-tuned. In such scenarios,
trainability of bottlenecked models turns out to be far more important for
achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation,
necessitating adoption of iterative methods. In this context, we prove
convergence of iterative singular value thresholding for training neural
networks subject to a soft rank constraint. To further illustrate the utility
of this perspective, we showcase how simple modifications to existing methods
through softer rank reduction result in improved performance under fixed
compression rates.

Conclusion: DyCAST-Net通过可解释的注意力热图揭示隐藏因果模式，适用于高维动态环境，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) is
essential for effective decision-making in fields such as finance and
marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge conventional
analytical approaches. We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal
Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel
architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated
temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net
effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated
convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its
attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy
and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens
robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference
reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets
demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as
TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation
of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in
noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights,
uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising
on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial
markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent
mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in
high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by
RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability
across diverse application domains

Motivation: 探索变压器在ICL中的工作机制，揭示其为何能在无梯度更新的情况下学习新任务。

Method: 通过合成线性回归任务和分布外泛化实验，分析变压器在ICL中的表现。

Result: 变压器在分布外数据上泛化能力差，且其行为与OLS等算法不一致；预训练数据分布对ICL行为有显著影响。

Conclusion: ICL的机制并非简单实现传统学习算法，而是依赖于预训练数据的分布特征。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large
pretrained transformers, enabling them to solve new tasks implicit in example
input-output pairs without any gradient updates. Despite its practical success,
the mechanisms underlying ICL remain largely mysterious. In this work we study
synthetic linear regression to probe how transformers implement learning at
inference time. Previous works have demonstrated that transformers match the
performance of learning rules such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
or gradient descent and have suggested ICL is facilitated in transformers
through the learned implementation of one of these techniques. In this work, we
demonstrate through a suite of out-of-distribution generalization experiments
that transformers trained for ICL fail to generalize after shifts in the prompt
distribution, a behaviour that is inconsistent with the notion of transformers
implementing algorithms such as OLS. Finally, we highlight the role of the
pretraining corpus in shaping ICL behaviour through a spectral analysis of the
learned representations in the residual stream. Inputs from the same
distribution as the training data produce representations with a unique
spectral signature: inputs from this distribution tend to have the same top two
singular vectors. This spectral signature is not shared by out-of-distribution
inputs, and a metric characterizing the presence of this signature is highly
correlated with low loss.

Abstract: Proactive maintenance strategies, such as Predictive Maintenance (PdM), play
an important role in the operation of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), particularly
due to their capacity to reduce offline time by preventing unexpected shutdowns
caused by component failures.
  In this work, we explore the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture combined with a computational thermomechanical model to calculate
the temperature, stress, and strain of a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) fuel
rod during operation. This estimation relies on a limited number of temperature
measurements from the cladding's outer surface. This methodology can
potentially aid in developing PdM tools for nuclear reactors by enabling
real-time monitoring of such systems.
  The training, validation, and testing datasets were generated through coupled
simulations involving BISON, a finite element-based nuclear fuel performance
code, and the MOOSE Thermal-Hydraulics Module (MOOSE-THM). We conducted eleven
simulations, varying the peak linear heat generation rates. Of these, eight
were used for training, two for validation, and one for testing.
  The CNN was trained for over 1,000 epochs without signs of overfitting,
achieving highly accurate temperature distribution predictions. These were then
used in a thermomechanical model to determine the stress and strain
distribution within the fuel rod.

Conclusion: FBM方法有效解决了现有问题，并通过时间-频率特征提取显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for
time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis
functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the
frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine
basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing
Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series
length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and
overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping
(FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features
through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our
approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal
characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of
neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better
performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear,
MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model
architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and
interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model
time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several
techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking,
centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale
down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for
both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.

Abstract: Clinical monitoring of functional decline in ALS relies on periodic
assessments that may miss critical changes occurring between visits. To address
this gap, semi-supervised regression models were developed to estimate rates of
decline in a case series cohort by targeting ALSFRS- R scale trajectories with
continuous in-home sensor monitoring data. Our analysis compared three model
paradigms (individual batch learning and cohort-level batch versus incremental
fine-tuned transfer learning) across linear slope, cubic polynomial, and
ensembled self-attention pseudo-label interpolations. Results revealed cohort
homogeneity across functional domains responding to learning methods, with
transfer learning improving prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales in 28 of 32
contrasts (mean RMSE=0.20(0.04)), and individual batch learning for predicting
the composite scale (mean RMSE=3.15(1.25)) in 2 of 3. Self-attention
interpolation achieved the lowest prediction error for subscale-level models
(mean RMSE=0.19(0.06)), capturing complex nonlinear progression patterns,
outperforming linear and cubic interpolations in 20 of 32 contrasts, though
linear interpolation proved more stable in all ALSFRS-R composite scale models
(mean RMSE=0.23(0.10)). We identified distinct homogeneity-heterogeneity
profiles across functional domains with respiratory and speech exhibiting
patient-specific patterns benefiting from personalized incremental adaptation,
while swallowing and dressing functions followed cohort-level trajectories
suitable for transfer models. These findings suggest that matching learning and
pseudo-labeling techniques to functional domain-specific
homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles enhances predictive accuracy in ALS
progression tracking. Integrating adaptive model selection within sensor
monitoring platforms could enable timely interventions and scalable deployment
in future multi-center studies.

Conclusion: La-Proteina在可扩展性和鲁棒性方面表现出色，能够生成长达800个残基的可共设计蛋白质。

Abstract: Recently, many generative models for de novo protein structure design have
emerged. Yet, only few tackle the difficult task of directly generating fully
atomistic structures jointly with the underlying amino acid sequence. This is
challenging, for instance, because the model must reason over side chains that
change in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina for atomistic
protein design based on a novel partially latent protein representation: coarse
backbone structure is modeled explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details
are captured via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality, thereby
effectively side-stepping challenges of explicit side-chain representations.
Flow matching in this partially latent space then models the joint distribution
over sequences and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple generation benchmarks, including all-atom
co-designability, diversity, and structural validity, as confirmed through
detailed structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also
surpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding performance, unlocking
critical atomistic structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover,
La-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up to 800 residues, a
regime where most baselines collapse and fail to produce valid samples,
demonstrating La-Proteina's scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Taylor's formula holds significant importance in function representation,
such as solving differential difference equations, ordinary differential
equations, partial differential equations, and further promotes applications in
visual perception, complex control, fluid mechanics, weather forecasting and
thermodynamics. However, the Taylor's formula suffers from the curse of
dimensionality and error propagation during derivative computation in discrete
situations. In this paper, we propose a new discrete differential operator to
estimate derivatives and to represent continuous smooth function locally using
the Vandermonde coefficient matrix derived from truncated Taylor series. Our
method simultaneously computes all derivatives of orders less than the number
of sample points, inherently mitigating error propagation. Utilizing
equidistant uniform sampling, it achieves high-order accuracy while alleviating
the curse of dimensionality. We mathematically establish rigorous error bounds
for both derivative estimation and function representation, demonstrating
tighter bounds for lower-order derivatives. We extend our method to the
two-dimensional case, enabling its use for multivariate derivative
calculations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed method compared to the finite forward difference method for derivative
estimation and cubic spline and linear interpolation for function

*Brett Daley,Prabhat Nagarajan,Martha White,Marlos C. Machado*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了基于两个非对称价值函数的TD学习方法（QV-learning和AV-learning），发现AV-learning在控制任务中优于Q-learning，并提出新算法RDQ，性能优于Dueling DQN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究使用两个价值函数（状态值和动作值）的TD学习方法是否比单一动作值函数更高效且理论可靠。

Method: 分析QV-learning和AV-learning的收敛性和样本效率，并引入新算法Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ)。

Result: AV-learning在控制任务中优于Q-learning，RDQ在MinAtar基准测试中显著优于Dueling DQN。

Conclusion: AV-learning方法在控制任务中具有优势，RDQ算法表现出色。

Abstract: The hallmark feature of temporal-difference (TD) learning is bootstrapping:
using value predictions to generate new value predictions. The vast majority of
TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single
action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less
attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value
functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in
learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as
either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been
investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is
advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether
such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze
these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We
find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the
prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over
Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning
algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly
outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.

Result: 通过一个关于霜冻事件的案例，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为数据不平衡情况下的XAI解释可靠性提供了初步见解和实用方法。

Abstract: The usage of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods has become
essential in practical applications, given the increasing deployment of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and the legislative requirements put
forward in the latest years. A fundamental but often underestimated aspect of
the explanations is their robustness, a key property that should be satisfied
in order to trust the explanations. In this study, we provide some preliminary
insights on evaluating the reliability of explanations in the specific case of
unbalanced datasets, which are very frequent in high-risk use-cases, but at the
same time considerably challenging for both AI models and XAI methods. We
propose a simple evaluation focused on the minority class (i.e. the less
frequent one) that leverages on-manifold generation of neighbours, explanation
aggregation and a metric to test explanation consistency. We present a use-case
based on a tabular dataset with numerical features focusing on the occurrence
of frost events.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving
data privacy. However, the rise of federated unlearning, designed to allow
clients to erase their data from the global model, introduces new privacy
concerns. Specifically, the gradient exchanges during the unlearning process
can leak sensitive information about deleted data. In this paper, we introduce
DRAGD, a novel attack that exploits gradient discrepancies before and after
unlearning to reconstruct forgotten data. We also present DRAGDP, an enhanced
version of DRAGD that leverages publicly available prior data to improve
reconstruction accuracy, particularly for complex datasets like facial images.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAGD and
DRAGDP significantly outperform existing methods in data reconstruction.Our
work highlights a critical privacy vulnerability in federated unlearning and
offers a practical solution, advancing the security of federated unlearning
systems in real-world applications.

Result: 在视觉Transformer任务中，MLoRQ性能提升高达15%，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLoRQ是一种高效且兼容性强的压缩方法，适用于边缘设备上的Transformer部署。

Abstract: Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed
through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision
quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization
(MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a
two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank
assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This
process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially
optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization
combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision
and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional
final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive
rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank
approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly
integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows
state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on
Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 解决LLM在跨文化、政治等维度上无法满足用户多样化偏好的问题。

Method: 通过大规模多语言人类研究，分析人类偏好与LLM响应的差异，提出负相关采样方法，并构建新的数据集。

Result: 发现人类偏好比LLM响应更多样化，现有数据集收集方法不足，负相关采样显著提升对齐方法的效果。

Conclusion: Community Alignment数据集为提升LLM对全球多样化用户的有效性提供了重要资源。

Abstract: How can large language models (LLMs) serve users with varying preferences
that may conflict across cultural, political, or other dimensions? To advance
this challenge, this paper establishes four key results. First, we demonstrate,
through a large-scale multilingual human study with representative samples from
five countries (N=15,000), that humans exhibit significantly more variation in
preferences than the responses of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs. Second, we show
that existing methods for preference dataset collection are insufficient for
learning the diversity of human preferences even along two of the most salient
dimensions of variability in global values, due to the underlying homogeneity
of candidate responses. Third, we argue that this motivates the need for
negatively-correlated sampling when generating candidate sets, and we show that
simple prompt-based techniques for doing so significantly enhance the
performance of alignment methods in learning heterogeneous preferences. Fourth,
based on this novel candidate sampling approach, we collect and open-source
Community Alignment, the largest and most representative multilingual and
multi-turn preference dataset to date, featuring almost 200,000 comparisons
from annotators spanning five countries. We hope that the Community Alignment
dataset will be a valuable resource for improving the effectiveness of LLMs for
a diverse global population.

Motivation: 填补严格不确定性量化与隐私保护机器学习之间的空白。

Method: 使用AES加密的MNIST数据集，测试$p$-value和$e$-value CP方法在加密数据上的表现。

Result: 加密数据上训练的模型仍能提取有意义结构，$e$-value CP覆盖率达60%，$p$-value CP预测集更小但覆盖准确性较低。

Conclusion: CP在加密数据中具有潜力，但需权衡预测集紧凑性与可靠性。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of Conformal Prediction (CP) with supervised
learning on deterministically encrypted data, aiming to bridge the gap between
rigorous uncertainty quantification and privacy-preserving machine learning.
Using AES-encrypted variants of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that CP
methods remain effective even when applied directly in the encrypted domain,
owing to the preservation of data exchangeability under fixed-key encryption.
We test traditional $p$-value-based against $e$-value-based conformal
predictors. Our empirical evaluation reveals that models trained on
deterministically encrypted data retain the ability to extract meaningful
structure, achieving 36.88\% test accuracy -- significantly above random
guessing (9.56\%) observed with per-instance encryption. Moreover,
$e$-value-based CP achieves predictive set coverage of over 60\% with 4.3
loss-threshold calibration, correctly capturing the true label in 4888 out of
5000 test cases. In contrast, the $p$-value-based CP yields smaller predictive
sets but with reduced coverage accuracy. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of CP in encrypted data settings and underscore
critical trade-offs between prediction set compactness and reliability. %Our
work sets a foundation for principled uncertainty quantification in secure,
privacy-aware learning systems.

TL;DR: 本文比较了生成式和判别式LSTM文本分类模型在边缘计算中的表现，重点研究了后训练量化（PTQ）对模型性能的影响，尤其是在噪声和类别不平衡数据下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算中的文本分类需要低延迟和高精度，生成式分类器对噪声和分布外数据具有鲁棒性，但其在边缘设备上的部署受计算和内存限制。PTQ是一种无需重新训练即可减小模型大小和计算成本的方法。

Method: 使用Brevitas量化库，对生成式和判别式LSTM模型进行PTQ，评估不同比特宽度下的性能，并分析噪声输入和类别不平衡校准数据的影响。

Result: 判别式分类器在量化后仍保持鲁棒性，而生成式分类器对比特宽度、校准数据和输入噪声更敏感。类别不平衡的校准数据会导致生成式分类器在低比特宽度下性能下降。

Conclusion: 校准数据在PTQ中起关键作用，生成式分类器在噪声和类别不平衡条件下可能表现不佳，需谨慎部署于边缘环境。

Abstract: Text classification plays a pivotal role in edge computing applications like
industrial monitoring, health diagnostics, and smart assistants, where low
latency and high accuracy are both key requirements. Generative classifiers, in
particular, have been shown to exhibit robustness to out-of-distribution and
noisy data, which is an extremely critical consideration for deployment in such
real-time edge environments. However, deploying such models on edge devices
faces computational and memory constraints. Post Training Quantization (PTQ)
reduces model size and compute costs without retraining, making it ideal for
edge deployment. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of
generative and discriminative Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based text
classification models with PTQ using the Brevitas quantization library. We
evaluate both types of classifier models across multiple bitwidths and assess
their robustness under regular and noisy input conditions. We find that while
discriminative classifiers remain robust, generative ones are more sensitive to
bitwidth, calibration data used during PTQ, and input noise during quantized
inference. We study the influence of class imbalance in calibration data for
both types of classifiers, comparing scenarios with evenly and unevenly
distributed class samples including their effect on weight adjustments and
activation profiles during PTQ. Using test statistics derived from
nonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data
during calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths
for generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance. This
study underscores the role of calibration data in PTQ and when generative
classifiers succeed or fail under noise, aiding deployment in edge
environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive open-source framework for developing
correlation kernels, with a particular focus on user-defined and composition of
kernels for surrogate modeling. By advancing kernel-based modeling techniques,
we incorporate frequency-aware elements that effectively capture complex
mechanical behaviors and timefrequency dynamics intrinsic to aircraft systems.
Traditional kernel functions, often limited to exponential-based methods, are
extended to include a wider range of kernels such as exponential squared sine
and rational quadratic kernels, along with their respective firstand
second-order derivatives. The proposed methodologies are first validated on a
sinus cardinal test case and then applied to forecasting Mauna-Loa Carbon
Dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and airline passenger traffic. All these
advancements are integrated into the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox
(SMT 2.0), providing a versatile platform for both standard and customizable
kernel configurations. Furthermore, the framework enables the combination of
various kernels to leverage their unique strengths into composite models
tailored to specific problems. The resulting framework offers a flexible
toolset for engineers and researchers, paving the way for numerous future
applications in metamodeling for complex, frequency-sensitive domains.

parallel, we introduce a perturbation-based ensemble model of EPT-2 for

Abstract: Habitats integrate the abiotic conditions and biophysical structures that
support biodiversity and sustain nature's contributions to people. As these
ecosystems face mounting pressure from human activities, accurate,
high-resolution habitat maps are essential for effective conservation and
restoration. Yet current maps often fall short in thematic or spatial
resolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive habitat types
that co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class imbalance that
complicate multi-class training. Here, we evaluated how high-resolution remote
sensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can improve habitat
classification over large geographic extents at fine thematic resolution. Using
vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive, we modelled Level 3
EUNIS habitats across Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against
independent validation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical
nature of habitat nomenclatures resolved classification ambiguities, especially
in fragmented landscapes. Integrating multi-spectral (MSI) and synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) imagery, particularly through Earth Observation Foundation
models, enhanced within-formation discrimination and overall performance.
Finally, ensemble machine learning that corrects class imbalance boosted
accuracy further. Our methodological framework is transferable beyond Europe
and adaptable to other classification systems. Future research should advance
temporal modelling of dynamic habitats, extend to habitat segmentation and
quality assessment, and exploit next-generation EO data paired with
higher-quality in-situ observations.

Conclusion: 该工作标志着从AI加速物理到AI发现物理的范式转变，建立了首个真正通用的物理模拟框架。

Abstract: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation
that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without
requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit
mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their
generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion
transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as
a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the
synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.
  By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial
relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium
mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential
time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach
bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state
solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our
data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned
representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),
revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical
constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics
to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics
simulation framework.

Conclusion: 非等变CNN通过适当训练可以替代复杂的等变模型，为分子生成提供更简单的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep generative models are increasingly used for molecular discovery, with
most recent approaches relying on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs)
under the assumption that explicit equivariance is essential for generating
high-quality 3D molecules. However, these models are complex, difficult to
train, and scale poorly.
  We investigate whether non-equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
trained with rotation augmentations can learn equivariance and match the
performance of equivariant models. We derive a loss decomposition that
separates prediction error from equivariance error, and evaluate how model
size, dataset size, and training duration affect performance across denoising,
molecule generation, and property prediction. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to analyze learned equivariance in generative tasks.

Abstract: Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) prediction is crucial for
understanding gene regulation and various biological processes. This study
introduces a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for TFBS prediction,
integrating multiple pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models,
each specializing in different TFBS patterns. We evaluate the performance of
our MoE model against individual expert models on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, using six randomly selected transcription
factors (TFs) for OOD testing. Our results demonstrate that the MoE model
achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse TF binding sites,
particularly excelling in OOD scenarios. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
statistical test confirms the significance of these performance differences.
Additionally, we introduce ShiftSmooth, a novel attribution mapping technique
that provides more robust model interpretability by considering small shifts in
input sequences. Through comprehensive explainability analysis, we show that
ShiftSmooth offers superior attribution for motif discovery and localization
compared to traditional Vanilla Gradient methods. Our work presents an
efficient, generalizable, and interpretable solution for TFBS prediction,

Result: 在三个工业数据集上，RGPD在RUL和SOH估计中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RGPD框架具有强鲁棒性和预测准确性，适用于多样化工业场景。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and State of Health (SOH)
is essential for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) across a wide range of
industrial applications. We propose a novel framework -- Reinforced Graph-Based
Physics-Informed Neural Networks Enhanced with Dynamic Weights (RGPD) -- that
combines physics-based supervision with advanced spatio-temporal learning.
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRNs) embed graph-convolutional
filters within recurrent units to capture how node representations evolve over
time. Graph Attention Convolution (GATConv) leverages a self-attention
mechanism to compute learnable, edge-wise attention coefficients, dynamically
weighting neighbor contributions for adaptive spatial aggregation. A Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) module is positioned between the Temporal Attention Unit
(TAU) and GCRN to further improve the spatio-temporal learning. This module
improves attention and prediction accuracy by dynamically scaling hidden
representations to minimize noise and highlight informative features. To
identify the most relevant physical constraints in each area, Q-learning agents

Abstract: Fast and accurate generation of molecular conformers is desired for
downstream computational chemistry and drug discovery tasks. Currently,
training and sampling state-of-the-art diffusion or flow-based models for
conformer generation require significant computational resources. In this work,
we build upon flow-matching and propose two mechanisms for accelerating
training and inference of generative models for 3D molecular conformer
generation. For fast training, we introduce the SO(3)-Averaged Flow training
objective, which leads to faster convergence to better generation quality
compared to conditional optimal transport flow or Kabsch-aligned flow. We
demonstrate that models trained using SO(3)-Averaged Flow can reach
state-of-the-art conformer generation quality. For fast inference, we show that
the reflow and distillation methods of flow-based models enable few-steps or
even one-step molecular conformer generation with high quality. The training
techniques proposed in this work show a path towards highly efficient molecular
conformer generation with flow-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理保留数据集子集的计算时间过长以及减少训练轮次的挑战是当前AMU的主要问题。

Method: 1. Blend：通过合并视觉相似的图像以减少保留集大小；2. A-AMU：通过增强遗忘目标函数加速收敛。

Result: 实验表明，这种双重优化方法显著减少了端到端遗忘延迟，同时保持了模型性能。

Conclusion: 这是首个通过联合设计专用数据集压缩技术和加速损失函数来系统解决遗忘效率的工作。

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning (AMU) enables models to `forget' specific
training data through specialized fine-tuning on a retained dataset subset.
However, processing this retained subset still dominates computational runtime,
while reductions of epochs also remain a challenge. We propose two
complementary methods to accelerate classification-oriented AMU. First,
\textbf{Blend}, a novel distribution-matching dataset condensation (DC), merges
visually similar images with shared blend-weights to significantly reduce the
retained set size. It operates with minimal pre-processing overhead and is
orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art DC methods. Second, our
loss-centric method, \textbf{Accelerated-AMU (A-AMU)}, augments the unlearning
objective to quicken convergence. A-AMU achieves this by combining a steepened
primary loss to expedite forgetting with a novel, differentiable regularizer
that matches the loss distributions of forgotten and in-distribution unseen
data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual approach of data and
loss-centric optimization dramatically reduces end-to-end unlearning latency
across both single and multi-round scenarios, all while preserving model
utility and privacy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
tackle unlearning efficiency by jointly designing a specialized dataset
condensation technique with a dedicated accelerated loss function. Code is

recommendation systems for its job matching product, including cold-start,
filter bubbles, and biases affecting candidate-job matching. To address these,
we developed the STAR (Signal Integration for Talent And Recruiters) system,
leveraging the combined strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph

member profiles and job postings, while GNNs capture intricate relationships
and mitigate cold-start issues through network effects. STAR integrates diverse
signals by uniting LLM and GNN capabilities with industrial-scale paradigms
including adaptive sampling and version management. It provides an end-to-end
solution for developing and deploying embeddings in large-scale recommender

high-performing recommendations, and practical insights for real-world model
deployment.

Result: 在METR-LA和PEMS-BAY数据集上表现优于标准基线和近期图联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效捕捉空间关系且计算高效，适用于交通预测任务。

Abstract: In traffic prediction, the goal is to estimate traffic speed or flow in
specific regions or road segments using historical data collected by devices
deployed in each area. Each region or road segment can be viewed as an
individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning
(FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing
raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model
updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each
client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging
(FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in
traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are
important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies
during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant
computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL
approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph
learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic
neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting
client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial
relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY,
and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard
baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.

Result: 发现了一种密集解，其效率优于理论构造，且具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络偏好的电路类型，为网络结构和可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Neural networks are capable of superposition -- representing more features
than there are dimensions. Recent work considers the analogous concept for
computation instead of storage, proposing theoretical constructions. But there
has been little investigation into whether these circuits can be learned in
practice. In this work, we investigate a toy model for the Universal-AND
problem which computes the AND of all $m\choose 2$ pairs of $m$ sparse inputs.
The hidden dimension that determines the number of non-linear activations is
restricted to pressure the model to find a compute-efficient circuit, called
compressed computation. We find that the training process finds a simple
solution that does not correspond to theoretical constructions. It is fully
dense -- every neuron contributes to every output. The solution circuit
naturally scales with dimension, trading off error rates for neuron efficiency.
It is similarly robust to changes in sparsity and other key parameters, and
extends naturally to other boolean operations and boolean circuits. We explain
the found solution in detail and compute why it is more efficient than the
theoretical constructions at low sparsity. Our findings shed light on the types
of circuits that models like to form and the flexibility of the superposition
representation. This contributes to a broader understanding of network
circuitry and interpretability.

Result: 在多个时间序列分类任务中，模型在低资源场景下显著优于先前方法，在资源丰富时仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 该模型结合了DTW的可解释性和神经网络的可训练性，适用于不同资源场景。

Abstract: Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in time series
classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for
training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they
lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast,
dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is
widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent
interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and
cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than
neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a
versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with
labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic
length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while
preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the
DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on
this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a
neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available,
while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to
several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it
significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and
remains competitive in rich-resource settings.

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) models latent cognitive states of human learners by
analyzing their response patterns on diagnostic tests, serving as a crucial
machine learning technique for educational assessment and evaluation.
Traditional cognitive diagnosis models typically follow a transductive
prediction paradigm that optimizes parameters to fit response scores and
extract learner abilities. These approaches face significant limitations as
they cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally
expensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability.
In this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that
fundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling
inductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We
propose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative
Item Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model
(G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional
methods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from
response prediction through a well-designed generation process that
incorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in
addressing scalability and reliability challenges, especially $\times 100$
speedup for the diagnosis of new learners. Our framework opens new avenues for
cognitive diagnosis applications in artificial intelligence, particularly for
intelligent model evaluation and intelligent education systems. The code is

Conclusion: 研究主张将任务异构性和时间结构编码为预训练目标的设计原则，以提升关系数据库的预测建模能力。

Abstract: Relational databases underpin critical infrastructure across a wide range of
domains, yet the design of generalizable pre-training strategies for learning
from relational databases remains an open challenge due to task heterogeneity.
Specifically, there exist infinitely many possible downstream tasks, as tasks
are defined based on relational schema graphs, temporal dependencies, and
SQL-defined label logics. An effective pre-training framework is desired to
take these factors into account in order to obtain task-aware representations.
By incorporating knowledge of the underlying distribution that drives label
generation, downstream tasks can benefit from relevant side-channel
information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task Vector Estimation (TVE), a
novel pre-training framework that constructs predictive supervisory signals via
set-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs, explicitly modeling
next-window relational dynamics. We formalize our approach through an
information-theoretic lens, demonstrating that task-informed representations
retain more relevant signals than those obtained without task priors. Extensive
experiments on the RelBench benchmark show that TVE consistently outperforms
traditional pre-training baselines. Our findings advocate for pre-training
objectives that encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure as design
principles for predictive modeling on relational databases.

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了提示优化的性能，适用于不同模型版本或API提供商的迁移场景。

Abstract: An increasing number of NLP applications interact with large language models
(LLMs) through black-box APIs, making prompt engineering critical for
controlling model outputs. While recent Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO)
methods iteratively refine prompts using model-generated feedback, textual
gradients, they primarily focus on error correction and neglect valuable
insights from correct predictions. This limits both their effectiveness and
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel APO framework centered on
enhancing the feedback mechanism. We reinterpret the textual gradient as a form
of negative reinforcement and introduce the complementary positive
reinforcement to explicitly preserve beneficial prompt components identified
through successful predictions. To mitigate the noise inherent in LLM-generated
feedback, we introduce a technique called feedback diversification, which
aggregates multiple feedback signals, emphasizing consistent, actionable advice
while filtering out outliers. Motivated by the rapid evolution and diversity of
available LLMs, we also formalize Continual Prompt Optimization (CPO),
addressing the practical challenge of efficiently migrating optimized prompts
between different model versions or API providers. Our experiments reveal that
naive prompt migration often degrades performance due to loss of critical
instructions. In contrast, our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, achieving significant accuracy improvements, faster convergence, and
lower computational costs in both standard and migration scenarios.

Motivation: 随着模型和数据集的规模迅速扩大，传统的预训练策略（如固定计算预算的余弦学习率调度）已不足以应对大规模训练需求。现有方法（如WSD和权重平均）存在灵活性不足或内存开销大的问题。

Method: 重新审视了Schedule-Free（SF）方法，并通过理论和实证分析揭示了其隐式权重平均的特性。在此基础上，提出了一种改进的SF变体，提高了对动量的鲁棒性，并在大批量训练中表现更好。

Conclusion: SF方法是一种实用、可扩展且理论支持的语言模型训练方法，改进后的变体解决了原方法的局限性。

Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional
pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate
schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent
alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight
averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay
phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at
the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable
alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024],
which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show
that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape
without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable
for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we
conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it
implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this
analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to
momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key
limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a
practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model
training.

Result: 该框架首次能够回答模型在所有可能任务上的平均性能和方差等关键问题。

Conclusion: 任务先验框架为SSL研究提供了更全面的评估标准，有望加速研究进展。

Abstract: The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning
(SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In
contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely
on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large
amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of
evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that
such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To
remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by
adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view,
one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream
tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as
(i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream
tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the
variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the
defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we
believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where
downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have
access to.

Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offer a safe and accessible
means of connecting the human brain to external devices, with broad
applications in home and clinical settings to enhance human capabilities.
However, the high noise level and limited task-specific data in non-invasive
signals constrain decoding capabilities. Recently, the adoption of
self-supervised pre-training is transforming the landscape of non-invasive BCI
research, enabling the development of brain foundation models to capture
generic neural representations from large-scale unlabeled
electroencephalography (EEG) signals with substantial noises. However, despite
these advances, the field currently lacks comprehensive, practical and
extensible benchmarks to assess the utility of the public foundation models
across diverse BCI tasks, hindering their widespread adoption. To address this
challenge, we present AdaBrain-Bench, a large-scale standardized benchmark to
systematically evaluate brain foundation models in widespread non-invasive BCI
tasks. AdaBrain-Bench encompasses a diverse collection of representative BCI
decoding datasets spanning 7 key applications. It introduces a streamlined task
adaptation pipeline integrated with multi-dimensional evaluation metrics and a
set of adaptation tools. The benchmark delivers an inclusive framework for
assessing generalizability of brain foundation models across key transfer
settings, including cross-subject, multi-subject, and few-shot scenarios. We
leverage AdaBrain-Bench to evaluate a suite of publicly available brain
foundation models and offer insights into practices for selecting appropriate

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing

TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning
frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their

TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across

Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法将数据视为离散序列，忽略了其作为连续过程噪声样本的本质。本文提出从函数族的角度重新定义预测任务，以解决离散观测无法唯一确定连续函数的问题。

Method: 提出NeuTSFlow框架，利用神经算子进行流匹配，学习历史与未来函数族之间的测度路径，直接在无限维函数空间中参数化流的速率场。

Result: 在多种预测任务上的实验表明，NeuTSFlow在准确性和鲁棒性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 从函数族的角度建模时间序列预测任务是一种有效的方法，NeuTSFlow展示了其在实践中的优越性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet
conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their
origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy
observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they
correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can
be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a
shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as
learning the transition from the historical function family to the future
function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we
leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships
between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the
transition path in function space from the historical function family to the
future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a
novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for
learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By
parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function
spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies
at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead.
Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior
accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family
perspective.

Abstract: Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
data analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent
graph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks
(GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of
high-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to
ambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph
constructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents
challenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary
edges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of
continuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information
loss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard
graphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures,
potentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering
outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph
Clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately
characterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge
weights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC
framework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative
binomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed
soft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering
optimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that
scSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy,
cell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its
substantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our
understanding of cellular heterogeneity.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络从有限经验中实现无限泛化的一种机制，为算法学习提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Even when massively overparameterized, deep neural networks show a remarkable
ability to generalize. Research on this phenomenon has focused on
generalization within distribution, via smooth interpolation. Yet in some
settings neural networks also learn to extrapolate to data far beyond the
bounds of the original training set, sometimes even allowing for infinite
generalization, implying that an algorithm capable of solving the task has been
learned. Here we undertake a case study of the learning dynamics of recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) trained on the streaming parity task in order to develop
an effective theory of algorithm development. The streaming parity task is a
simple but nonlinear task defined on sequences up to arbitrary length. We show
that, with sufficient finite training experience, RNNs exhibit a phase
transition to perfect infinite generalization. Using an effective theory for
the representational dynamics, we find an implicit representational merger
effect which can be interpreted as the construction of a finite automaton that
reproduces the task. Overall, our results disclose one mechanism by which
neural networks can generalize infinitely from finite training experience.

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，DepBERT优于现有最先进的监督方法。

Conclusion: DepBERT通过结合依赖树，显著提升了因果关系短语提取的性能。

Abstract: Extracting cause and effect phrases from a sentence is an important NLP task,
with numerous applications in various domains, including legal, medical,
education, and scientific research. There are many unsupervised and supervised
methods proposed for solving this task. Among these, unsupervised methods
utilize various linguistic tools, including syntactic patterns, dependency
tree, dependency relations, etc. among different sentential units for
extracting the cause and effect phrases. On the other hand, the contemporary
supervised methods use various deep learning based mask language models
equipped with a token classification layer for extracting cause and effect
phrases. Linguistic tools, specifically, dependency tree, which organizes a
sentence into different semantic units have been shown to be very effective for
extracting semantic pairs from a sentence, but existing supervised methods do
not have any provision for utilizing such tools within their model framework.
In this work, we propose DepBERT, which extends a transformer-based model by
incorporating dependency tree of a sentence within the model framework.
Extensive experiments over three datasets show that DepBERT is better than
various state-of-the art supervised causality extraction methods.

Motivation: 在安全关键领域（如核工程）中部署LLM需要理解其内部推理过程，以满足核监管框架的验证要求。

Method: 采用参数高效微调技术（Low-Rank Adaptation）对通用LLM进行核领域适配，并通过神经元沉默技术分析关键神经元的作用。

Result: 研究发现，单独沉默关键神经元影响不显著，但集体沉默会导致任务性能显著下降，且模型生成技术信息的能力受损。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升LLM透明度提供了可行路径，有助于实现核级AI保障，满足核监管要求。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains,
such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their
internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for
interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a
Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM
(Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation
patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a
sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the
adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we
employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while
silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a
statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively
led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative
analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's
ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This
paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an
opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable
neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade
artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and
validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR
50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear
operations.

Motivation: 大语言模型容易记忆重复序列，引发隐私和版权担忧，现有后处理方法效果有限。

Method: 提出MemSinks范式，利用序列标识符激活特定记忆神经元，隔离记忆内容。

Result: 在十亿参数和十亿标记规模下实现有效隔离和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MemSinks首次证明在真实数据上同时实现泛化和隔离是可行的。

Abstract: Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences,
posing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to
remove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such
approaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show
that the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically
plausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language
abilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we
put forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization
by design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of
memorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the
dynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates
isolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising
general language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter
and billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong
generalization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real
data demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is
achievable. We open-source our code at http://github.com/grghosal/MemSinks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整神经元数量的方法，以解决类别不平衡问题，提升少数类别的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物学启发，人类海马体在学习过程中会不断生成和修剪神经元，表明灵活分配容量可能提升性能。现实数据集中类别不平衡问题常见，固定大小网络会降低少数类别的识别准确率。

Method: 在训练过程中定期增加和移除神经元，动态调整容量，同时保留多数类别的关键特征。最终网络大小和结构保持不变。

Result: 在三个数据集和五种模型上的实验表明，该方法优于固定大小网络，结合其他不平衡处理技术时效果更佳。

Conclusion: 动态、受生物学启发的网络设计能有效提升类别不平衡数据的性能。

Abstract: In conventional deep learning, the number of neurons typically remains fixed
during training. However, insights from biology suggest that the human
hippocampus undergoes continuous neuron generation and pruning of neurons over
the course of learning, implying that a flexible allocation of capacity can
contribute to enhance performance. Real-world datasets often exhibit class
imbalance situations where certain classes have far fewer samples than others,
leading to significantly reduce recognition accuracy for minority classes when
relying on fixed size networks.To address the challenge, we propose a method
that periodically adds and removes neurons during training, thereby boosting
representational power for minority classes. By retaining critical features
learned from majority classes while selectively increasing neurons for
underrepresented classes, our approach dynamically adjusts capacity during
training. Importantly, while the number of neurons changes throughout training,
the final network size and structure remain unchanged, ensuring efficiency and
compatibility with deployment.Furthermore, by experiments on three different
datasets and five representative models, we demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms fixed size networks and shows even greater accuracy when
combined with other imbalance-handling techniques. Our results underscore the
effectiveness of dynamic, biologically inspired network designs in improving
performance on class-imbalanced data.

Result: 在大规模职位数据集上实验，模型显著优于现有方法，解决了冷启动问题并提升了动态匹配能力。

Conclusion: 研究为招聘行业提供了更准确的职位分类框架，支持更明智的决策。

Abstract: In the dynamic realm of online recruitment, accurate job classification is
paramount for optimizing job recommendation systems, search rankings, and labor
market analyses. As job markets evolve, the increasing complexity of job titles
and descriptions necessitates sophisticated models that can effectively
leverage intricate relationships within job data. Traditional text
classification methods often fall short, particularly due to their inability to
fully utilize the hierarchical nature of industry categories. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel representation learning and classification
model that embeds jobs and hierarchical industry categories into a latent
embedding space. Our model integrates the Standard Occupational Classification
(SOC) system and an in-house hierarchical taxonomy, Carotene, to capture both
graph and hierarchical relationships, thereby improving classification
accuracy. By embedding hierarchical industry categories into a shared latent
space, we tackle cold start issues and enhance the dynamic matching of
candidates to job opportunities. Extensive experimentation on a large-scale
dataset of job postings demonstrates the model's superior ability to leverage
hierarchical structures and rich semantic features, significantly outperforming
existing methods. This research provides a robust framework for improving job
classification accuracy, supporting more informed decision-making in the
recruitment industry.

Motivation: 推荐系统在潜在空间中具有低秩结构，但如何有效定义和测量潜在空间中的距离以捕捉用户和物品关系是一个关键挑战。

Method: 通过行和列距离近似潜在空间距离，引入方差校正以减少噪声影响，并提出径向邻域估计器（RNE）来构建邻域并提高插补准确性。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的评估表明，RNE优于现有的协同过滤和矩阵分解方法，并缓解了冷启动问题。

Conclusion: 论文提出的距离估计方法和RNE为推荐系统提供了一种更结构化的邻域构建方式，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems inherently exhibit a low-rank structure in latent space.
A key challenge is to define meaningful and measurable distances in the latent
space to capture user-user, item-item, user-item relationships effectively. In
this work, we establish that distances in the latent space can be
systematically approximated using row-wise and column-wise distances in the
observed matrix, providing a novel perspective on distance estimation. To
refine the distance estimation, we introduce the correction based on empirical
variance estimator to account for noise-induced non-centrality. The novel
distance estimation enables a more structured approach to constructing
neighborhoods, leading to the Radial Neighborhood Estimator (RNE), which
constructs neighborhoods by including both overlapped and partially overlapped
user-item pairs and employs neighborhood smoothing via localized kernel
regression to improve imputation accuracy. We provide the theoretical
asymptotic analysis for the proposed estimator. We perform evaluations on both
simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating that RNE achieves superior
performance compared to existing collaborative filtering and matrix
factorization methods. While our primary focus is on distance estimation in
latent space, we find that RNE also mitigates the ``cold-start'' problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNNWR方法在建模空间非平稳性时受限于固定的距离方案和有限的归纳偏差，需要更灵活的模型来适应不同数据特性。

Method: 通过引入卷积神经网络、循环神经网络和Transformer的局部感受野、序列上下文和自注意力机制，扩展了GNNWR的框架。

Result: 改进后的GNNWR在合成空间数据集上表现优于传统方法，尤其在非线性关系建模和小样本场景中。模型性能与数据特性密切相关。

Conclusion: 归纳偏差在空间建模中至关重要，未来研究方向包括可学习的空间加权函数、混合神经网络架构以及提升非平稳空间数据模型的解释性。

Abstract: Inductive bias is a key factor in spatial regression models, determining how
well a model can learn from limited data and capture spatial patterns. This
work revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted
Regression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for
modeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional
Geographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial
weighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed
distance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize
GNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent
neural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields,
sequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through
extensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying
heterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic
methods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results
also reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics,
with local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios,
and global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data. These
findings highlight the importance of inductive bias in spatial modeling and
suggest future directions, including learnable spatial weighting functions,
hybrid neural architectures, and improved interpretability for models handling
non-stationary spatial data.

Conclusion: TDCRL通过因果学习机制，有效提取域不变特征，显著提升源自由域泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep learning often struggles when training and test data distributions
differ. Traditional domain generalization (DG) tackles this by including data
from multiple source domains, which is impractical due to expensive data
collection and annotation. Recent vision-language models like CLIP enable
source-free domain generalization (SFDG) by using text prompts to simulate
visual representations, reducing data demands. However, existing SFDG methods
struggle with domain-specific confounders, limiting their generalization
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose TDCRL
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{R}epresentation
\textbf{L}earning), the first method to integrate causal inference into the
SFDG setting. TDCRL operates in two steps: first, it employs data augmentation
to generate style word vectors, combining them with class information to
generate text embeddings to simulate visual representations; second, it trains
a causal intervention network with a confounder dictionary to extract
domain-invariant features. Grounded in causal learning, our approach offers a
clear and effective mechanism to achieve robust, domain-invariant features,
ensuring robust generalization. Extensive experiments on PACS, VLCS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet show state-of-the-art performance, proving TDCRL
effectiveness in SFDG.

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和效率上优于现有机器学习方法，提供了设计复杂度的可控性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently gained significant attention
for solving compliance minimization (CM) problems. However, these methods
typically provide poor feature boundaries, are very expensive, and lack a
systematic mechanism to control the design complexity. Herein, we address these
limitations by proposing a mesh-free and simultaneous framework based on
physics-informed Gaussian processes (GPs). In our approach, we parameterize the
design and state variables with GP priors which have independent kernels but
share a multi-output neural network (NN) as their mean function. The
architecture of this NN is based on Parametric Grid Convolutional Attention
Networks (PGCANs) which not only mitigate spectral bias issues, but also
provide an interpretable mechanism to control design complexity. We estimate
all the parameters of our GP-based representations by simultaneously minimizing
the compliance, total potential energy, and residual of volume fraction
constraint. Importantly, our loss function exclude all data-based residuals as
GPs automatically satisfy them. We also develop computational schemes based on
curriculum training and numerical integration to increase the efficiency and
robustness of our approach which is shown to (1) produce super-resolution
topologies with fast convergence, (2) achieve smaller compliance and less gray
area fraction compared to traditional numerical methods, (3) provide control
over fine-scale features, and (4) outperform competing ML-based methods.

Motivation: 现有单细胞基础模型（如scGPT）无法利用生物学文本信息，而LLMs虽表现优异但缺乏对其性能驱动因素的理解。

Result: scMPT表现优于单一模型，且在不同数据集上性能更稳定。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为单细胞基础模型的补充，提升单细胞分析性能。

Abstract: Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT represent a significant
advancement in single-cell omics, with an ability to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on various downstream biological tasks. However, these models are
inherently limited in that a vast amount of information in biology exists as
text, which they are unable to leverage. There have therefore been several
recent works that propose the use of LLMs as an alternative to single-cell
foundation models, achieving competitive results. However, there is little
understanding of what factors drive this performance, along with a strong focus
on using LLMs as an alternative, rather than complementary approach to
single-cell foundation models. In this study, we therefore investigate what
biological insights contribute toward the performance of LLMs when applied to
single-cell data, and introduce scMPT; a model which leverages synergies
between scGPT, and single-cell representations from LLMs that capture these
insights. scMPT demonstrates stronger, more consistent performance than either
of its component models, which frequently have large performance gaps between
each other across datasets. We also experiment with alternate fusion methods,
demonstrating the potential of combining specialized reasoning models with
scGPT to improve performance. This study ultimately showcases the potential for
LLMs to complement single-cell foundation models and drive improvements in
single-cell analysis.

Abstract: As machine learning gets adopted into the industry quickly, trustworthiness
is increasingly in focus. Yet, efficiency and sustainability of robust training
pipelines still have to be established. In this work, we consider a simple
pipeline for training adversarially robust decision trees and investigate the
efficiency of each step. Our pipeline consists of three stages. Firstly, we
choose the perturbation size automatically for each dataset. For that, we
introduce a simple algorithm, instead of relying on intuition or prior work.
Moreover, we show that the perturbation size can be estimated from smaller
models than the one intended for full training, and thus significant gains in
efficiency can be achieved. Secondly, we train state-of-the-art adversarial
training methods and evaluate them regarding both their training time and
adversarial accuracy. Thirdly, we certify the robustness of each of the models
thus obtained and investigate the time required for this. We find that
verification time, which is critical to the efficiency of the full pipeline, is
not correlated with training time.

This low SL utility of synthetic data stems from class imbalance exaggeration
and SL data relationship overlooked by tabular generator. To address these
challenges, we draw inspirations from techniques in emerging data-centric
artificial intelligence and elucidate Pruning and ReOrdering ('PRRO'), a novel
pipeline that integrates data-centric techniques into tabular data synthesis.
PRRO incorporates data pruning to guide the table generator towards
observations with high signal-to-noise ratio, ensuring that the class
distribution of synthetic data closely matches that of the original data.
Besides, PRRO employs a column reordering algorithm to align the data modeling
structure of generators with that of SL models. These two modules enable PRRO
to optimize SL utility of synthetic data. Empirical experiments on 22 public
datasets show that synthetic data generated using PRRO enhances predictive
performance compared to data generated without PRRO. Specifically, synthetic
replacement of original data yields an average improvement of 26.74% and up to
871.46% improvement using PRRO, while synthetic appendant to original data
results with PRRO-generated data results in an average improvement of 6.13% and
up to 200.32%. Furthermore, experiments on six highly imbalanced datasets show
that PRRO enables the generator to produce synthetic data with a class
distribution that resembles the original data more closely, achieving a
similarity improvement of 43%. Through PRRO, we foster a seamless integration
of data synthesis to subsequent SL prediction, promoting quality and accessible
data analysis.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we study a second-order approach to policy optimization in
reinforcement learning. Existing second-order methods often suffer from
suboptimal sample complexity or rely on unrealistic assumptions about
importance sampling. To overcome these limitations, we propose VR-CR-PN, a
variance-reduced cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first algorithm that integrates Hessian-aided variance
reduction with second-order policy optimization, effectively addressing the
distribution shift problem and achieving best-known sample complexity under
general nonconvex conditions but without the need for importance sampling. We
theoretically establish that VR-CR-PN achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-second-order
stationary point, significantly improving upon the previous best result of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ under comparable assumptions. As an
additional contribution, we introduce a novel Hessian estimator for the
expected return function, which admits a uniform upper bound independent of the
horizon length $H$, allowing the algorithm to achieve horizon-independent
sample complexity.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply is critical for optimizing
sustainable energy systems, yet it is challenged by the variability of
renewable sources and dynamic consumption patterns. This paper introduces a
neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs), graph attention, multi-resolution wavelet
transformations, and adaptive learning of frequencies to address the issues of
time series prediction. The model employs a robust ODE solver, using the
Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections
to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through
wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly
captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated
across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity
transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this
architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various
forecasting metrics, proving its robustness in capturing complex temporal
dependencies. Furthermore, the model enhances interpretability through SHAP
analysis, making it suitable for sustainable energy applications.

Motivation: 联邦学习在边缘设备上的实际应用面临数据标注成本高、协变量偏移和资源限制等挑战，需要一种高效且适应性强的方法。

Method: 采用预训练源模型（包括深度主干、适应模块和分类器），冻结主干和分类器，仅通过适应模块处理目标域适应，并扩展支持流数据。

Result: 实验证明FedAcross+在低端设备上能有效适应目标域，处理域偏移问题，并支持资源受限环境下的间歇性模型更新。

Conclusion: FedAcross+为联邦学习在工业环境中的实际部署提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a leading paradigm for decentralized,
privacy-preserving learning, particularly relevant in the era of interconnected
edge devices equipped with sensors. However, the practical implementation of
Federated Learning faces three primary challenges: the need for human
involvement in costly data labelling processes for target adaptation, covariate
shift in client device data collection due to environmental factors affecting
sensors, leading to discrepancies between source and target samples, and the
impracticality of continuous or regular model updates in resource-constrained
environments due to limited data transmission capabilities and technical
constraints on channel availability and energy efficiency. To tackle these
issues, we expand upon an efficient and scalable Federated Learning framework
tailored for real-world client adaptation in industrial settings. This
framework leverages a pre-trained source model comprising a deep backbone, an
adaptation module, and a classifier running on a powerful server. By freezing
the backbone and classifier during client adaptation on resource-constrained
devices, we allow the domain adaptive linear layer to handle target domain
adaptation, thus minimizing overall computational overhead. Furthermore, this
setup, designated as FedAcross+, is extended to encompass the processing of
streaming data, thereby rendering the solution suitable for non-stationary
environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
FedAcross+ in achieving competitive adaptation on low-end client devices with
limited target samples, successfully addressing the challenge of domain shift.
Moreover, our framework accommodates sporadic model updates within
resource-constrained environments, ensuring practical and seamless deployment.

Motivation: TN秩在张量分解中至关重要，但其缺乏通用定义和直观解释，常被作为超参数调整。论文旨在澄清这一概念。

Method: 通过实际案例和图形化方法，展示如何利用领域知识选择TN秩，并揭示TN秩与张量展开矩阵秩的关系。

Result: 提供了一种直观理解TN秩的方法，支持领域驱动的TN设计，避免了复杂的多指标张量代数。

Conclusion: 论文为读者提供了对TN秩的清晰统一理解，有助于在实际应用和教育中更好地选择和解释张量方法。

Abstract: Tensor Network (TN) decompositions have emerged as an indispensable tool in
Big Data analytics owing to their ability to provide compact low-rank
representations, thus alleviating the ``Curse of Dimensionality'' inherent in
handling higher-order data. At the heart of their success lies the concept of
TN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions.
However, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an
intuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across
different TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as
empirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters
inferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to
demystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks
through real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by
illustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in
widely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker
decompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory
graphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a
perspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the
corresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing
cumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN
design. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear
and unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary
physical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and
deployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational
contexts.

Abstract: Play style identification can provide valuable game design insights and
enable adaptive experiences, with the potential to improve game playing agents.
Previous work relies on domain knowledge to construct play trace
representations using handcrafted features. More recent approaches incorporate
the sequential structure of play traces but still require some level of domain
abstraction. In this study, we explore the use of unsupervised CNN-LSTM
autoencoder models to obtain latent representations directly from low-level
play trace data in MicroRTS. We demonstrate that this approach yields a
meaningful separation of different game playing agents in the latent space,
reducing reliance on domain expertise and its associated biases. This latent
space is then used to guide the exploration of diverse play styles within
studied AI players.

Abstract: Dynamic graph learning methods have recently emerged as powerful tools for
modelling relational data evolving through time. However, despite extensive
benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as
periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we
introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set
of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs
to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that
isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions,
inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over
both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning
methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to
generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the
limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional
real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with
stronger temporal reasoning abilities. The code for T-GRAB can be found at:

Conclusion: 该工作连接了统计充分性、图论表示和深度学习，为神经网络提供了新的统计理解。

Abstract: This paper analyzes neural networks through graph variables and statistical
sufficiency. We interpret neural network layers as graph-based transformations,
where neurons act as pairwise functions between inputs and learned anchor
points. Within this formulation, we establish conditions under which layer
outputs are sufficient for the layer inputs, that is, each layer preserves the
conditional distribution of the target variable given the input variable. Under
dense anchor point assumptions, we prove that asymptotic sufficiency holds in
the infinite-width limit and is preserved throughout training. To align more
closely with practical architectures, we further show that sufficiency can be
achieved with finite-width networks by assuming region-separated input
distributions and constructing appropriate anchor points. Our framework covers
fully connected layers, general pairwise functions, ReLU and sigmoid
activations, and convolutional neural networks. This work bridges statistical
sufficiency, graph-theoretic representations, and deep learning, providing a
new statistical understanding of neural networks.

Method: 引入轻量级BO框架，优化输入层权重的统计分布参数，结合最小二乘优化输出层参数。

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中，KAPI-ELM在正向和逆向问题中均达到最佳精度，且参数更少。

Conclusion: KAPI-ELM是一种可扩展、可解释且通用的物理信息学习框架，特别适用于刚性PDE问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Kernel Adaptive Physics-Informed Extreme Learning
Machine (KAPI-ELM), an adaptive Radial Basis Function (RBF)-based extension of
PI-ELM designed to solve both forward and inverse Partial Differential Equation
(PDE) problems involving localized sharp gradients. While PI-ELMs outperform
the traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in speed due to their
single-shot, least square optimization, this advantage comes at a cost: their
fixed, randomly initialized input layer limits their ability to capture sharp
gradients. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a lightweight Bayesian
Optimization (BO) framework that, instead of adjusting each input layer
parameter individually as in traditional backpropagation, learns a small set of
hyperparameters defining the statistical distribution from which the input
weights are drawn. This novel distributional optimization strategy -- combining
BO for input layer distributional parameters with least-squares optimization
for output layer network parameters -- enables KAPI-ELM to preserve PI-ELM's
speed while matching or exceeding the expressiveness of PINNs. We validate the
proposed methodology on several challenging forward and inverse PDE benchmarks,
including a 1D singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equation, a 2D Poisson
equation with sharp localized sources, and a time-dependent advection equation.
Notably, KAPI-ELM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both forward and
inverse settings. In stiff PDE regimes, it matches or even outperforms advanced
methods such as the Extended Theory of Functional Connections (XTFC), while
requiring nearly an order of magnitude fewer tunable parameters. These results
establish the potential of KAPI-ELM as a scalable, interpretable, and
generalizable physics-informed learning framework, especially in stiff PDE
regimes.

Conclusion: SAFE-T展示了条件生成化学语言模型在统一评分与生成任务中的潜力，可加速早期药物发现。

Abstract: Generative chemical language models (CLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in molecular design, yet their impact in drug discovery remains
limited by the absence of reliable reward signals and the lack of
interpretability in their outputs. We present SAFE-T, a generalist chemical
modeling framework that conditions on biological context -- such as protein
targets or mechanisms of action -- to prioritize and design molecules without
relying on structural information or engineered scoring functions. SAFE-T
models the conditional likelihood of fragment-based molecular sequences given a
biological prompt, enabling principled scoring of molecules across tasks such
as virtual screening, drug-target interaction prediction, and activity cliff
detection. Moreover, it supports goal-directed generation by sampling from this
learned distribution, aligning molecular design with biological objectives. In
comprehensive zero-shot evaluations across predictive (LIT-PCBA, DAVIS, KIBA,
ACNet) and generative (DRUG, PMO) benchmarks, SAFE-T consistently achieves
performance comparable to or better than existing approaches while being
significantly faster. Fragment-level attribution further reveals that SAFE-T
captures known structure-activity relationships, supporting interpretable and
biologically grounded design. Together with its computational efficiency, these
results demonstrate that conditional generative CLMs can unify scoring and
generation to accelerate early-stage drug discovery.

Conclusion: 实验验证了所提算法的鲁棒性和有效性，为动态数据集提供了更稳定的聚类方法。

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for unsupervised learning
with numerous applications. However, in the application of modern algorithms,
the datasets studied are usually large and dynamic. If the hierarchical
clustering is sensitive to small perturbations of the dataset, the usability of
the algorithm will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we focus on the
hierarchical $k$ -median clustering problem, which bridges hierarchical and
centroid-based clustering while offering theoretical appeal, practical utility,
and improved interpretability. We analyze the average sensitivity of algorithms
for this problem by measuring the expected change in the output when a random
data point is deleted. We propose an efficient algorithm for hierarchical
$k$-median clustering and theoretically prove its low average sensitivity and
high clustering quality. Additionally, we show that single linkage clustering
and a deterministic variant of the CLNSS algorithm exhibit high average
sensitivity, making them less stable. Finally, we validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our algorithm through experiments.

Abstract: Early detection of dementia is critical for timely medical intervention and
improved patient outcomes. Neuropsychological tests are widely used for

from speech recordings of such tests. We propose Demenba, a novel ADC framework
based on state space models, which scale linearly in memory and computation
with sequence length. Trained on over 1,000 hours of cognitive assessments
administered to Framingham Heart Study participants, some of whom were
diagnosed with dementia through adjudicated review, our method outperforms
prior approaches in fine-grained dementia classification by 21\%, while using
fewer parameters. We further analyze its scaling behavior and demonstrate that
our model gains additional improvement when fused with large language models,
paving the way for more transparent and scalable dementia assessment tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without
centralizing raw data. However, practical FL deployments often face a key
realistic challenge: Clients participate intermittently in server aggregation
and with unknown, possibly biased participation probabilities. Most existing
convergence results either assume full-device participation, or rely on
knowledge of (in fact uniform) client availability distributions -- assumptions
that rarely hold in practice. In this work, we characterize the optimization
problem that consistently adheres to the stochastic dynamics of the well-known
\emph{agnostic Federated Averaging (FedAvg)} algorithm under random (and
variably-sized) client availability, and rigorously establish its convergence
for convex, possibly nonsmooth losses, achieving a standard rate of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the aggregation horizon. Our
analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for agnostic FedAvg under
general, non-uniform, stochastic client participation, without knowledge of the
participation distribution. We also empirically demonstrate that agnostic
FedAvg in fact outperforms common (and suboptimal) weighted aggregation FedAvg
variants, even with server-side knowledge of participation weights.

Conclusion: 为未来研究提供基准，并推荐多变量方法提升运动捕捉数据的完整性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Motion capture (MoCap) data from wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
is vital for applications in sports science, but its utility is often
compromised by missing data. Despite numerous imputation techniques, a
systematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is
lacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis
of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our
evaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series,
multivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To
facilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap
dataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate
practitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing
completely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent
pattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic
variables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks
consistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex
missingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean
absolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate
techniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative
Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the
highest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical
baseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving
the integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.

Abstract: This paper examines the $L_p$ and $W^1_p$ norm approximation errors of ReLU

derive nearly optimal super-approximation error bounds of order $2m$ in the
$L_p$ norm and order $2m-2$ in the $W^1_p$ norm, for target functions with
$L_p$ mixed derivative of order $m$ in each direction. The analysis leverages
sparse grid finite elements and the bit extraction technique. Our results
improve upon classical lowest order $L_\infty$ and $H^1$ norm error bounds and
demonstrate that the expressivity of neural networks is largely unaffected by

Abstract: In this paper, we design an algorithm to accelerate the diffusion process on

necessitates substantial time for denoising perturbed data. To overcome this

diffusion models to address the pose ambiguity problem. Moreover, we show that
this acceleration advantage occurs without any measurable degradation in task
reward. The experiments reveal that our algorithm achieves a speed-up of up to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异构联邦学习方法结合集成蒸馏时效果不佳且不稳定，主要原因是仅依赖logit蒸馏无法解决异构模型带来的知识偏差。

Method: 提出FedFD方法，利用正交投影技术对齐特征信息，为每种客户端模型架构维护投影层以优化知识蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明FedFD在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedFD通过特征蒸馏和正交投影有效解决了异构联邦学习中的知识偏差问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing
attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models
while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients,
ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often
employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global
model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not
always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The
reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,
while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for
the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous
Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature
information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous
models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge
distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to
maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align
the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize
the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and
thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT)的多时间范围预测模型，用于解决电商和实体零售中需求预测的挑战，特别是在销售高峰期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的长期需求预测对供应链管理至关重要，尤其是在高风险的销售事件期间，需求峰值难以预测。

Method: TAT模型结合了编码器和解码器，并引入了新颖的Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA)机制，利用已知的上下文变量（如节假日和促销信息）来提升预测性能。

Result: 在两个大型电商数据集上的实验表明，TAT在需求峰值预测上实现了高达30%的准确率提升，同时保持了整体性能的竞争力。

Conclusion: TAT通过上下文依赖的对齐机制，显著提升了高峰需求预测的准确性，为供应链管理提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Multi-horizon time series forecasting has many practical applications such as
demand forecasting. Accurate demand prediction is critical to help make buying
and inventory decisions for supply chain management of e-commerce and physical
retailers, and such predictions are typically required for future horizons
extending tens of weeks. This is especially challenging during high-stake sales
events when demand peaks are particularly difficult to predict accurately.
However, these events are important not only for managing supply chain
operations but also for ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers.
To address this challenge, we propose Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT), a
multi-horizon forecaster leveraging apriori-known context variables such as
holiday and promotion events information for improving predictive performance.
Our model consists of an encoder and decoder, both embedded with a novel
Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA), designed to learn context-dependent
alignment for peak demand forecasting. We conduct extensive empirical analysis
on two large-scale proprietary datasets from a large e-commerce retailer. We
demonstrate that TAT brings up to 30% accuracy improvement on peak demand
forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: DeepONets在岩土工程中应用有限，本文评估了几种架构在一维固结问题中的表现，提出改进的Model 4，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DeepONets在岩土工程中的应用潜力，解决传统方法计算效率低的问题。

Method: 比较三种DeepONet架构，提出基于Fourier特征的改进模型（Model 4）。

Result: Model 4表现最佳，计算速度提升1.5至100倍，适用于快速变化函数。

Conclusion: DeepONets在岩土工程中具有高效、通用的潜力，推动了科学机器学习在该领域的应用。

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have emerged as a powerful surrogate
modeling framework for learning solution operators in PDE-governed systems.
While their use is expanding across engineering disciplines, applications in
geotechnical engineering remain limited. This study systematically evaluates
several DeepONet architectures for the one-dimensional consolidation problem.
We initially consider three architectures: a standard DeepONet with the
coefficient of consolidation embedded in the branch net (Models 1 and 2), and a
physics-inspired architecture with the coefficient embedded in the trunk net
(Model 3). Results show that Model 3 outperforms the standard configurations
(Models 1 and 2) but still has limitations when the target solution (excess
pore pressures) exhibits significant variation. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Trunknet Fourier feature-enhanced DeepONet (Model 4) that addresses
the identified limitations by capturing rapidly varying functions. All proposed
architectures achieve speedups ranging from 1.5 to 100 times over traditional
explicit and implicit solvers, with Model 4 being the most efficient. Larger
computational savings are expected for more complex systems than the explored
1D case, which is promising. Overall, the study highlights the potential of
DeepONets to enable efficient, generalizable surrogate modeling in geotechnical
applications, advancing the integration of scientific machine learning in
geotechnics, which is at an early stage.

Abstract: With the rise of smart mobility and shared e-mobility services, numerous
advanced technologies have been applied to this field. Cloud-based traffic
simulation solutions have flourished, offering increasingly realistic
representations of the evolving mobility landscape. LLMs have emerged as
pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including

XiYanSQL achieves an average execution accuracy of 0.81 on system operator
queries and 0.98 on user queries.

TL;DR: 论文提出TagBERT模型，利用语义标签改进电商查询重构任务，性能优于BERT等模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电商搜索引擎中查询与用户意图的语义鸿沟问题，现有深度学习方法未充分利用语义标签。

Method: 将查询重构视为令牌分类任务，设计依赖感知的Transformer模型TagBERT，利用语义标签学习查询短语嵌入。

Result: 在大规模电商数据集上，TagBERT性能优于BERT、eBERT和序列到序列Transformer模型。

Conclusion: TagBERT通过语义标签显著提升查询重构效果，为电商搜索提供更优解决方案。

Abstract: The major task of any e-commerce search engine is to retrieve the most
relevant inventory items, which best match the user intent reflected in a
query. This task is non-trivial due to many reasons, including ambiguous
queries, misaligned vocabulary between buyers, and sellers, over- or
under-constrained queries by the presence of too many or too few tokens. To
address these challenges, query reformulation is used, which modifies a user
query through token dropping, replacement or expansion, with the objective to
bridge semantic gap between query tokens and users' search intent. Early
methods of query reformulation mostly used statistical measures derived from
token co-occurrence frequencies from selective user sessions having clicks or
purchases. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches, specifically
transformer-based neural language models, or sequence-to-sequence models are
being used for query reformulation task. However, these models do not utilize
the semantic tags of a query token, which are significant for capturing user
intent of an e-commerce query. In this work, we pose query reformulation as a
token classification task, and solve this task by designing a dependency-aware
transformer-based language model, TagBERT, which makes use of semantic tags of
a token for learning superior query phrase embedding. Experiments on large,
real-life e-commerce datasets show that TagBERT exhibits superior performance
than plethora of competing models, including BERT, eBERT, and
Sequence-to-Sequence transformer model for important token classification task.

Motivation: 复杂反应（如多键协同变化的环化反应）的机制搜索存在挑战，需要高效且成本可控的方法。

Method: 结合图枚举和机器学习筛选，使用神经网络势能（AIMNet2-rxn）评估候选反应路径。

Result: 验证了NNP在预测活化能和立体选择性方面的能力，并成功应用于天然产物合成的关键步骤。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂反应机制搜索提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reaction mechanism search tools have demonstrated the ability to provide
insights into likely products and rate-limiting steps of reacting systems.
However, reactions involving several concerted bond changes - as can be found
in many key steps of natural product synthesis - can complicate the search
process. To mitigate these complications, we present a mechanism search
strategy particularly suited to help expedite exploration of an exemplary
family of such complex reactions, cyclizations. We provide a cost-effective
strategy for identifying relevant elementary reaction steps by combining
graph-based enumeration schemes and machine learning techniques for
intermediate filtering. Key to this approach is our use of a neural network
potential (NNP), AIMNet2-rxn, for computational evaluation of each candidate
reaction pathway. In this article, we evaluate the NNP's ability to estimate
activation energies, demonstrate the correct anticipation of stereoselectivity,
and recapitulate complex enabling steps in natural product synthesis.

Motivation: 解决算子学习中的不确定性量化问题，结合随机控制和深度算子网络的优势。

Result: 在2D和3D噪声算子复制任务中验证了SON的有效性。

Conclusion: SON能够有效学习算子中的不确定性，为不确定性量化提供了新方法。

Abstract: We develop a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in operator
learning, the Stochastic Operator Network (SON). SON combines the stochastic
optimal control concepts of the Stochastic Neural Network (SNN) with the
DeepONet. By formulating the branch net as an SDE and backpropagating through
the adjoint BSDE, we replace the gradient of the loss function with the
gradient of the Hamiltonian from Stohastic Maximum Principle in the SGD update.
This allows SON to learn the uncertainty present in operators through its
diffusion parameters. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of SON when
replicating several noisy operators in 2D and 3D.

Result: 蒸馏模型在SINR水平上表现出更低的错误率，验证了KD在降低能耗的同时保持性能的有效性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是实现高效AI解决方案的有效方法，特别是在需要平衡能效与性能的场景中。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of balancing energy efficiency with
performance in AI/ML models, focusing on DeepRX, a deep learning receiver based
on a fully convolutional ResNet architecture. We evaluate the energy
consumption of DeepRX, considering factors including FLOPs/Watt and
FLOPs/clock, and find consistency between estimated and actual energy usage,
influenced by memory access patterns. The research extends to comparing energy
dynamics during training and inference phases. A key contribution is the
application of knowledge distillation (KD) to train a compact DeepRX
\textit{student} model that emulates the performance of the \textit{teacher}
model but with reduced energy consumption. We experiment with different student
model sizes, optimal teacher sizes, and KD hyperparameters. Performance is
measured by comparing the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance versus
Signal-to-Interference \& Noise Ratio (SINR) values of the distilled model and
a model trained from scratch. The distilled models demonstrate a lower error
floor across SINR levels, highlighting the effectiveness of KD in achieving
energy-efficient AI solutions.

Motivation: 传统语言模型在给定上下文时存在多解问题，LoRA-MCL旨在解决这一模糊性。

Method: 采用多选择学习和Winner-Takes-All损失，结合低秩适应（LoRA）处理模糊性。

Result: 在视觉和音频字幕任务中，生成结果具有高多样性和相关性。

Conclusion: LoRA-MCL有效解决了语言模型中的多解问题，生成结果更丰富且合理。

Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in
language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence
continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an
intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple futures may be
equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and
the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying
Multiple Choice Learning to Language Modeling, assuming the data is generated
from a mixture of distributions. To illustrate the proposed approach, we use
data sampled from mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with extensive
experiments on real-world visual and audio captioning tasks that our method
achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs.

Motivation: 共形预测在非交换性数据（如分布偏移）下覆盖率保证失效，现有方法需预知偏移类型，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用最优传输理论，分析分布偏移对共形预测的影响，并提出覆盖率损失的估计与缓解方法。

Result: 研究表明，通过最优传输可以估计覆盖率损失，并在分布偏移下有效缓解。

Conclusion: 本文为分布偏移下的共形预测提供了新视角和方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method
that has gained popularity in the machine learning community due to its
finite-sample guarantees and ease of use. Its most common variant, dubbed split
conformal prediction, is also computationally efficient as it boils down to
collecting statistics of the model predictions on some calibration data not yet
seen by the model. Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration
and test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and
often violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature
is rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable
setting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of
distribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this
problem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show
that it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate it in case of
distribution shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线持续学习中数据以小批量到达、计算预算固定且任务边界缺失时，自监督学习技术的不足。

Method: 提出Continual Latent Alignment (CLA)，通过对齐当前模型学习到的表征与过去表征来减少遗忘。

Result: CLA在在线场景下加速训练收敛，优于同类方法；作为预训练协议时，性能优于完全独立同分布预训练。

Conclusion: CLA是一种有效的在线持续学习自监督策略，兼具训练效率和最终性能优势。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is able to build latent representations that
generalize well to unseen data. However, only a few SSL techniques exist for
the online CL setting, where data arrives in small minibatches, the model must
comply with a fixed computational budget, and task boundaries are absent. We
introduce Continual Latent Alignment (CLA), a novel SSL strategy for Online CL
that aligns the representations learned by the current model with past
representations to mitigate forgetting. We found that our CLA is able to speed
up the convergence of the training process in the online scenario,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under the same computational budget.
Surprisingly, we also discovered that using CLA as a pretraining protocol in
the early stages of pretraining leads to a better final performance when
compared to a full i.i.d. pretraining.

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have emerged as general-purpose tools for
addressing a variety of complex computer vision problems. Such models have been
shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, lacking some basic visual
understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations
of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks by constructing a series of tests that
probe which components of design, specifically, may be lacking. Importantly, we
go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, which simply measure the final
performance of VLM response, by also comparing and contrasting it to the
performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from the visual
encoder, intermediate vision-language projection and LLM-decoder output. In
doing so, we uncover shortcomings in VLMs and make a number of important
observations about their capabilities, robustness and how they process visual
information. We hope our insights will guide progress in further improving
VLMs.

Motivation: 研究动机在于解决连续时间LQR问题中收敛速率随初始条件变化而消失的问题，以及梯度估计误差对优化过程的影响。

Method: 方法包括应用PLI及其推广条件，结合输入到状态稳定性（ISS）分析梯度估计误差的影响。

Result: 结果表明，连续时间LQR问题表现出全局线性/局部指数收敛行为，而离散时间LQR问题则具有全局指数收敛性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，推广的PLI条件是理解收敛行为和梯度误差影响的关键，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Solutions of optimization problems, including policy optimization in
reinforcement learning, typically rely upon some variant of gradient descent.
There has been much recent work in the machine learning, control, and
optimization communities applying the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz Inequality (PLI) to
such problems in order to establish an exponential rate of convergence (a.k.a.
``linear convergence'' in the local-iteration language of numerical analysis)
of loss functions to their minima under the gradient flow. Often, as is the
case of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate
vanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /
locally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time
LQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT
and DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like
conditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these
generalizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects
of errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from
adversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a
simulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic
computations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from
limited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of
this issue. The lecture also discussed convergence and PLI-like properties of
``linear feedforward neural networks'' in feedback control, but this arXiv
skips that part (to be updated). Much of the work described here was done in
collaboration with Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Leilei Cui, Zhong-Ping
Jiang, and Milad Siami.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统加权NMF方法因使用乘法更新而收敛慢，需一种既能抗异常值又能高效计算的方法。

Method: 采用自适应加权中位数变换平滑数据，与Fast-HALS算法结合，保持加法更新结构。

Result: 在图像数据集上，Target Polish在精度上优于或匹配现有方法，计算时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: Target Polish在抗异常值和计算效率上均表现优异，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces the "Target Polish," a robust and computationally
efficient framework for nonnegative matrix and tensor factorization. Although
conventional weighted NMF approaches are resistant to outliers, they converge
slowly due to the use of multiplicative updates to minimize the objective
criterion. In contrast, the Target Polish approach remains compatible with the
Fast-HALS algorithm, which is renowned for its speed, by adaptively smoothing
the data with a weighted median-based transformation. This innovation provides
outlier resistance while maintaining the highly efficient additive update
structure of Fast-HALS. Empirical evaluations using image datasets corrupted
with structured (block) and unstructured (salt) noise demonstrate that the
Target Polish approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art
robust NMF methods and reduces computational time by an order of magnitude in
the studied scenarios.

Motivation: 解决神经网络在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，验证EWC方法的有效性。

Method: 使用PermutedMNIST和RotatedMNIST基准测试，比较EWC与L2正则化和SGD的效果，并分析超参数和dropout的影响。

Result: EWC显著减少了遗忘，但略微降低了新任务的学习效率；超参数和dropout对其性能有影响。

Conclusion: EWC是神经网络终身学习的可行解决方案，但在实际应用中需权衡遗忘减少与学习效率。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is the primary challenge that hinders continual
learning, which refers to a neural network ability to sequentially learn
multiple tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. Elastic Weight
Consolidation, a regularization-based approach inspired by synaptic
consolidation in biological neural systems, has been used to overcome this
problem. In this study prior research is replicated and extended by evaluating
EWC in supervised learning settings using the PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST
benchmarks. Through systematic comparisons with L2 regularization and
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) without regularization, we analyze how
different approaches balance knowledge retention and adaptability. Our results
confirm what was shown in previous research, showing that EWC significantly
reduces forgetting compared to naive training while slightly compromising
learning efficiency on new tasks. Moreover, we investigate the impact of
dropout regularization and varying hyperparameters, offering insights into the
generalization of EWC across diverse learning scenarios. These results
underscore EWC's potential as a viable solution for lifelong learning in neural
networks.

Motivation: 尽管分割学习（SL）在保护客户端数据方面有潜力，但其易受攻击的特性引发了隐私担忧。SplitHappens旨在通过结合FSS和U形SL，提供更高的安全性。

Method: 采用功能秘密共享（FSS）和U形分割学习（SL）结合的方法，隐藏公共输入并保护训练数据标签。

Conclusion: SplitHappens通过FSS和U形SL的结合，显著提升了分割学习的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) -- splits a model into two distinct parts to help protect
client data while enhancing Machine Learning (ML) processes. Though promising,
SL has proven vulnerable to different attacks, thus raising concerns about how
effective it may be in terms of data privacy. Recent works have shown promising
results for securing SL through the use of a novel paradigm, named Function
Secret Sharing (FSS), in which servers obtain shares of a function they compute
and operate on a public input hidden with a random mask. However, these works
fall short in addressing the rising number of attacks which exist on SL. In
SplitHappens, we expand the combination of FSS and SL to U-shaped SL. Similarly
to other works, we are able to make use of the benefits of SL by reducing the
communication and computational costs of FSS. However, a U-shaped SL provides a
higher security guarantee than previous works, allowing a client to keep the
labels of the training data secret, without having to share them with the
server. Through this, we are able to generalize the security analysis of
previous works and expand it to different attack vectors, such as modern model
inversion attacks as well as label inference attacks. We tested our approach
for two different convolutional neural networks on different datasets. These
experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the training
time as well as the communication costs when compared to simply using FSS while

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds immense promise for transforming biology, yet a
lack of standardized, cross domain, benchmarks undermines our ability to build
robust, trustworthy models. Here, we present insights from a recent workshop
that convened machine learning and computational biology experts across
imaging, transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics to tackle this gap. We
identify major technical and systemic bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity
and noise, reproducibility challenges, biases, and the fragmented ecosystem of
publicly available resources and propose a set of recommendations for building
benchmarking frameworks that can efficiently compare ML models of biological
systems across tasks and data modalities. By promoting high quality data
curation, standardized tooling, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and open,
collaborative platforms, we aim to accelerate the development of robust
benchmarks for AI driven Virtual Cells. These benchmarks are crucial for
ensuring rigor, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and will ultimately
advance the field toward integrated models that drive new discoveries,
therapeutic insights, and a deeper understanding of cellular systems.

Motivation: 探讨强化学习对LLMs推理能力的影响，并揭示Qwen2.5模型在基准测试中可能存在的不可靠性。

Method: 引入生成完全合成算术问题的数据集RandomCalculation，用于评估RL方法的效果。

Result: 在无污染的数据集上，仅准确的奖励信号能提升性能，而噪声或错误信号无效。

Conclusion: 建议在无污染的基准测试和多样化模型家族中评估RL方法，以确保结论的可信度。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a
longstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these
capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming
significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,
some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance
reasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the
Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,
AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like
Llama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although
Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on
large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular
benchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be
unreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully
synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a
clean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we
show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while
noisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on
uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure
trustworthy conclusions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了在重尾类别不平衡分布下，常见私有学习优化算法的优化行为，发现DP-GD在低频类别学习中表现不佳，而估计二阶信息的算法（如DP-AdamBC）能避免这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在重尾类别不平衡分布下，私有学习优化算法的表现差异，特别是针对低频类别的学习效果。

Method: 通过理论模型和实验对比DP-GD与DP-AdamBC在重尾类别不平衡数据上的优化行为。

Result: DP-AdamBC在去除DP偏差后，显著改善了低频类别的学习效果，训练准确率分别提升了约8%和5%。

Conclusion: DP-AdamBC是解决重尾类别不平衡问题的有效方法，尤其在低频类别学习中表现优越。

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the optimization behaviour of common private
learning optimization algorithms under heavy-tail class imbalanced
distribution. We show that, in a stylized model, optimizing with Gradient
Descent with differential privacy (DP-GD) suffers when learning low-frequency
classes, whereas optimization algorithms that estimate second-order information
do not. In particular, DP-AdamBC that removes the DP bias from estimating loss
curvature is a crucial component to avoid the ill-condition caused by
heavy-tail class imbalance, and empirically fits the data better with
$\approx8\%$ and $\approx5\%$ increase in training accuracy when learning the
least frequent classes on both controlled experiments and real data
respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了Graph World Model (GWM)，支持多模态和结构化数据，通过消息传递算法和动作节点实现多样任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型无法处理结构化数据（如图数据），且图基础模型局限于图学习任务，无法扩展到多模态数据和跨学科任务。

Method: GWM采用通用消息传递算法，支持多模态数据（GWM-T和GWM-E）和动作节点，实现任务多样性。

Result: 在六项任务中，GWM表现优于或匹配领域基线，并展示零样本/少样本能力。

Conclusion: GWM为多模态和结构化数据的世界模型提供了通用解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: World models (WMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in prediction, generation,
and planning tasks. Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and
cannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in
the digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed,
they focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal
data and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the
Graph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and
graph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse
tasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to
aggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space
by converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal
embedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces
action nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other
nodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on
six tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,
recommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,
and planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches
domain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and
demonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks. Our
code for GWM is released at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GWM.

TL;DR: 论文提出FusionBench和FusionFactory，通过多级融合框架（查询级、思维级、模型级）优化LLM路由，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有应用多依赖单一后端模型，无法充分利用不同LLM的互补优势，导致性能和效率受限。

Method: 提出FusionBench基准测试和FusionFactory框架，包括查询级、思维级和模型级融合。

Result: 实验表明FusionFactory在所有14个基准测试中均优于单一LLM。

Conclusion: 系统性LLM融合能有效利用互补优势，提升整体性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a vibrant
ecosystem of diverse architectures, each with unique strengths due to
differences in design, training data, and objectives. However, most
applications still rely on a single backend model, limiting coverage of
capabilities and leading to inefficiencies in performance and token cost when
tackling complex tasks. We highlight an underexploited opportunity: LLM routing
data, produced when hosting platforms route diverse queries to different
models, which can reveal comparative strengths across tasks. To address this,
we propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks
across five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing
103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models.
Building on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework
with three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query
using both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level
fusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers
to similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities
between models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as
training data. Experiments show FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best
individual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with optimal fusion configurations
varying by benchmark, demonstrating the value of systematic LLM fusion in
harnessing complementary strengths and improving overall performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的解缠方法，通过拆分嵌套规则的节点，提升了神经DNF模型的性能，使其在分类任务中表现更接近翻译前模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经DNF模型在翻译后性能下降，部分原因是未能解缠网络权重中的学习知识。

Method: 提出解缠方法，拆分嵌套规则的节点为独立节点。

Result: 在多种分类任务中，解缠方法提供了紧凑且可解释的逻辑表示，性能更接近翻译前模型。

Conclusion: 解缠方法有效提升了神经DNF模型的性能，同时保持了其可解释性。

Abstract: Neural Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based models are powerful and
interpretable approaches to neuro-symbolic learning and have shown promising
results in classification and reinforcement learning settings without prior
knowledge of the tasks. However, their performance is degraded by the
thresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here
that part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its
failure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the
networks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement
method; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent
nodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through
experiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks
(including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our
disentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical
representations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to
that of their pre-translation counterparts. Our code is available at
https://github.com/kittykg/disentangling-ndnf-classification.
