Building on\nthis tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition\nformation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo,\nusing a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in\nthis process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent\ncoalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains\nan open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates\nagent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to\ngenerate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document\nwriting, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our\napproach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models\nto induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design\nalgorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To\nevaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that\nAI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where\ntraditional tools are limited."}

We address this limitation by introducing a\nframework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during\ntest time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better\nplanning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by\ncentralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning, we propose a \\textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)}\nparadigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents\nlearn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend\nthe embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support\ninformed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and\niteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on\nnew experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining\nindividual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and\nflexible adaptation for LLM agents.

In our model, an agent may strategically\nmisreport the proposed element's utility, unlike the standard delegated choice\nproblem which assumes that the agent truthfully reports the utility for the\nproposed alternative. Thus, the principal needs to inspect the proposed element\npossibly along with other alternatives to maximize its own utility, given an\nexogenous cost of inspecting each element. Further, the delegation itself\nincurs a fixed cost, thus the principal can decide whether to delegate or not\nand inspect by herself.\n  We show that DCIC indeed is a generalization of PNOI where the side\ninformation from a strategic agent is available at certain cost, implying its\nNP-hardness by Fu, Li, and Liu (STOC'23). We first consider a costless\ndelegation setting in which the cost of delegation is free. We prove that the\nmaximal mechanism over the pure delegation with a single inspection and an PNOI\npolicy without delegation achieves a $3$-approximation for DCIC with costless\ndelegation, which is further proven to be tight.

In this paper, we introduce CPS-Guard, a novel\nframework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative\nassurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g.,\nsafety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning)\nto dedicated agents within a simulated environment, CPS-Guard continuously\nevaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability\nrequirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an\nautonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner.

Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk\nor Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and\nits role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and\nbuying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual\nin the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that\nencodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.\nThe population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.\nRecombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation\nis applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The\nevaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that\nconsiders the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community\nlevel, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the\ndegradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated\nscenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds,\nto reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of\nmicrogrids batteries.

Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk\nor Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and\nits role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and\nbuying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual\nin the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that\nencodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.\nThe population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.\nRecombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation\nis applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The\nevaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that\nconsiders the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community\nlevel, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the\ndegradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated\nscenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds,\nto reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of\nmicrogrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the\n100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the\neffectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the\nindividual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community."}

In this paper, we propose an alternative learning objective.\nInstead of using the raw input as the reconstruction target, we employ the\nDiscrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the input. The DFT provides meaningful\nglobal information at each frequency level, making individual frequency\ncomponents useful as separate learning targets. When dealing with\nmultidimensional input data, the DFT offers remarkable flexibility by enabling\nselective transformation across specific dimensions while preserving others in\nthe computation. Moreover, certain types of input exhibit distinct patterns in\ntheir frequency distributions, where specific frequency components consistently\ncontain most of the magnitude, allowing us to focus on a subset of frequencies\nrather than the entire spectrum.

Despite its impressive\nalgorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices\nremains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper\npresents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.\nFirst, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of\ncommon terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve\nthis, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses\nshared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,\neffectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by\nidentifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,\nwe introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent\nblending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for\ncostly hardware sorters.

We view this\nas a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and\nwarrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed\nand validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred\nto as LLM-D12.

To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative\nframework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that\nleverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,\nmulti-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key\nalgorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and\nVariable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data\nfrom multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where\nindividual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting\nmechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data\nfrom multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in\nreal-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We\ndevelop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped\nrobotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework.

Recent research advocates for installing battery energy storage\nsystems as well as undergrounding risky overhead lines to reduce the load\nshedding during such de-energizations. Since wildfire ignition risk can exhibit\nsubstantial geographic and temporal variations, it is important to plan battery\ninstallation and line undergrounding investments while considering multiple\npossible scenarios. This paper presents a scenario-based framework for\noptimizing battery installation and line undergrounding investments while\nconsidering many scenarios, each consisting of a day-long time series of\nuncertain parameters for the load demand, renewable generation, and wildfire\nignition risks. This problem is difficult to solve due to a large number of\nscenarios and binary variables associated with the battery placements as well\nas the lines to be undergrounded. To address the computational challenges, we\ndecompose the problem in a two-stage scheme via a Benders decomposition\napproach. The first stage is a master problem formulated as a mixed integer\nlinear programming (MILP) model that makes decisions on the locations and sizes\nof batteries as well as the lines to be undergrounded. The second stage\nconsists of a linear programming model that assesses these battery and line\nundergrounding decisions as modeled by a DC OPF formulation.

However, performing per-Gaussian\nneural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting\nrendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper,\nwe present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general\npipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS\nrepresentations by reducing neural inference through two complementary\ntechniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that\nidentifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene\nreconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that\nimproves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.\nSecond, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters\nGaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation\nper group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our\ntechniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\\times$, reduce model size by\n$7.71\\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.\nSpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\\times$ and $58.23\\times$ on\nthe D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets.

We remark that training a client locally\non more data than necessary does not benefit the overall performance of all\nclients. In this paper, we devise a novel framework that leverages a Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to select an optimized amount of data\nnecessary to train a client model without oversharing information with the\nserver. Starting without awareness of the client's performance, the DRL agent\nutilizes the change in training loss as a reward signal and learns to optimize\nthe amount of training data necessary for improving the client's performance.\nSpecifically, after each aggregation round, the DRL algorithm considers the\nlocal performance as the current state and outputs the optimized weights for\neach class, in the training data, to be used during the next round of local\ntraining. In doing so, the agent learns a policy that creates an optimized\npartition of the local training dataset during the FL rounds. After FL, the\nclient utilizes the entire local training dataset to further enhance its\nperformance on its own data distribution, mitigating the non-IID effects of\naggregation.

However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex\ncomposition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to\nlimitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and\nvocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an\nLM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of\nparallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the\ncombined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony,\nand dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for\nhigh-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a\nmodular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different\ntoken types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we\nintroduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a\nsemi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both\nobjective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the\neffectiveness of our designs.

We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To\noperationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision\ntraining objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to\nprevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value\ncaching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree\nsearch. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.\nAdditionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model\n(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)\nto accelerate future research in LLM safety.

To adapt to these changing preferences and promptly\ncorrect any inaccurate estimations, collaborative robots must accurately track\nthese dynamic human intentions in real time. We propose a Hierarchical\nIntention Tracking (HIT) algorithm for collaborative robots to track dynamic\nand hierarchical human intentions effectively in real time. HIT represents\nhuman intentions as intention trees with arbitrary depth, and probabilistically\ntracks human intentions by Bayesian filtering, upward measurement propagation,\nand downward posterior propagation across all levels. We develop a HIT-based\nrobotic system that dynamically switches between Interaction-Task and\nVerification-Task trees for a collaborative assembly task, allowing the robot\nto effectively coordinate human intentions at three levels: task-level (subtask\ngoal locations), interaction-level (mode of engagement with the robot), and\nverification-level (confirming or correcting intention recognition).

In\nthis paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic\nframework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks\ntrained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in\nthis regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus\nwhere neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons\nrapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step\nprocess: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a\ncost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each\nround, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and\na drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these\ndrops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and\nextends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks\nand attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular\nmodes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we\nprove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization.\nApplying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give\nthe first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that\nnetworks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude.\nAltogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning\nin neural networks."}

In particular, we\nemploy a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify\ncorrespondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered\nimages. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style\nloss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to\nvarious objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to\nenhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve\nmemory efficient training, more texture details and better color match.

However, global\nconvergence has only been proven for the case of $m=2$, and EM is known to fail\nto recover the ground truth when $m\\geq 3$.\n  In this paper, we consider the $\\textit{over-parameterized}$ setting, where\nthe learning model uses $n>m$ components to fit an $m$-component ground truth\nGMM. In contrast to the exact-parameterized case, we provide a rigorous global\nconvergence guarantee for gradient EM. Specifically, for any well separated\nGMMs in general position, we prove that with only mild over-parameterization $n\n= \\Omega(m\\log m)$, randomly initialized gradient EM converges globally to the\nground truth at a polynomial rate with polynomial samples. Our analysis\nproceeds in two stages and introduces a suite of novel tools for Gaussian\nMixture analysis.

While notable progress has been made in\ntranslating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved\naway from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing\nefforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality,\nincrease parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention,\nthe application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces\nsimilar challenges.\n  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that\nachieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention\nmechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard\ntraining procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for\nexplicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical\ntop-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that\navoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard\ntop-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN\nparameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for\nidentifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from\nenforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the\nGemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on\nstandard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN\nneurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens.

In semantically sparse scenarios,\nCL struggles with view construction, and gradient imbalance between positive\nand negative samples persists. This paper introduces HetCRF, a novel\ndual-channel self-supervised learning framework for heterogeneous graphs.\nHetCRF uses a two-stage aggregation strategy to adapt embedding semantics,\nmaking it compatible with both MAE and CL. To address semantic sparsity, it\nenhances encoder output for view construction instead of relying on raw\nfeatures, improving efficiency. Two positive sample augmentation strategies are\nalso proposed to balance gradient contributions. Node classification\nexperiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that\nHetCRF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. On datasets with missing node\nfeatures, such as Aminer and Freebase, at a 40% label rate in node\nclassification, HetCRF improves the Macro-F1 score by 2.75% and 2.2%\nrespectively compared to the second-best baseline, validating its effectiveness\nand superiority."}

Existing UCOD methods\ntypically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1\nconvolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared\nto fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches:\n1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label\ncontaining substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn\nthe semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized\nobjects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between\nforeground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a\nteacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL,\nwhich contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial\n(DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism.

Most existing methods assume that all\nqueries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric\ncosts; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may\ntrigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly\nthan others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,\neffective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we\npropose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query\ncosts, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core\ncomponents of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation\nprocess. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative\nvariant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and\nAsymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution\nto favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total\nattack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods\nsuch as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)\nqueries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box\nattacks with minimal changes.

Reg-GRPO\nreformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the\nadvantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping\nand min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning\nthe model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data\naugmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable\ndifficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our\ncomprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video\nreasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks."}

Adaptive graph\nconvolution networks have emerged as mainstream solutions due to their ability\nto learn node embeddings in a data-driven manner and capture complex latent\ndependencies. However, existing adaptive graph learning methods for traffic\nforecasting often either ignore the regularization of node embeddings, which\naccount for a significant proportion of model parameters, or face scalability\nissues from expensive graph convolution operations. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a Regularized Adaptive Graph Learning (RAGL) model.\nFirst, we introduce a regularized adaptive graph learning framework that\nsynergizes Stochastic Shared Embedding (SSE) and adaptive graph convolution via\na residual difference mechanism, achieving both embedding regularization and\nnoise suppression. Second, to ensure scalability on large road networks, we\ndevelop the Efficient Cosine Operator (ECO), which performs graph convolution\nbased on the cosine similarity of regularized embeddings with linear time\ncomplexity.

Typical training processes\nof PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to\nonly one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and\nvideo content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that\nincorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we\npropose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous\ntext-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:\nuncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include\ncommonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates\npair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL\nhierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive\nlearning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained\nrelationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the\ntext-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the\ninherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often\ncontains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the\ntext-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to\nmitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to\ndetect ambiguous pairs for its training.

To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy.

We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with\na contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve\naccurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language\nembeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven\ninstance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and\nsegment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.\nWe show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++\nvalidation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."}

We employ two effective steps to\nmake data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D\nrepresentation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows\nus to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second,\nwe develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware\nInpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These\ntwo steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale\nsingle-view images, namely \\textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we\ndemonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from\nlarge-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised\nmethods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models\nserve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream\nvideo tasks."}

To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based\nMamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image\nrestoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the\nmodel's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a\nCLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with\nCLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal\nfeature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various\ndegradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies\nand fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that\nintegrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range\nmodeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative\noptimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,\npreserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we\nintroduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances\nglobal modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention\nto degradation-sensitive regions.

In this paper, we prove that\nthe convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and\nsample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers\nto the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of\nthe individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper\nbounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total\nnumber of samples scheduled for local update.

This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make\nuse of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that\ncharacterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically\ndisregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original\nintroduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant\nnode interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive\nadvantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while\nmaintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials.
