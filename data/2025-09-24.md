### [1] [PolypSeg-GradCAM: Towards Explainable Computer-Aided Gastrointestinal Disease Detection Using U-Net Based Segmentation and Grad-CAM Visualization on the Kvasir Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18159)
*Akwasi Asare,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PolypSeg-GradCAM框架，结合U-Net和Grad-CAM实现可解释的结肠息肉分割，在Kvasir-SEG数据集上取得优异性能（IoU 0.9257），增强AI辅助结肠镜检查的可信度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌是全球主要癌症死因，胃肠道息肉是重要前兆。现有深度学习方法分割准确但缺乏可解释性，阻碍临床应用。需要开发透明可靠的自动化息肉分割方法

Method: 集成U-Net架构和梯度加权类激活映射（Grad-CAM），构建可解释深度学习框架。在包含1000张标注内镜图像的Kvasir-SEG数据集上进行训练和评估

Result: 测试集平均交并比（IoU）达0.9257，训练和验证集Dice系数（F-score）均超过0.96。Grad-CAM可视化证实预测基于临床相关区域

Conclusion: PolypSeg-GradCAM将高分割精度与可解释性结合，是迈向可靠AI辅助结肠镜检查和改善早期结直肠癌预防的重要一步

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as
critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and
accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing
CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to
observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential
for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a
barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an
explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp
segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of
1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust
segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96)
on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that
predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency
and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with
interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable,
trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer
prevention.

### [3] [Self Identity Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18165)
*Xiuding Cai,Yaoyao Zhu,Linjie Fu,Dong Miao,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SIM（Self Identity Mapping）正则化框架，通过逆映射机制减少前向传播中的信息损失，提升表示学习能力。ρSIM是其高效实现版本，适用于多种任务和架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法依赖启发式规则，在不同设置下效果不稳定。需要一种数据内在的、通用的正则化方法来提升泛化能力。

Method: SIM框架通过从变换后的输出重构输入，减少信息损失并促进梯度平滑流动。ρSIM采用补丁级特征采样和基于投影的方法重构潜在特征，降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在图像分类、少样本提示学习和领域泛化等任务上，ρSIM相比基线方法取得一致改进。与现有正则化方法正交，能进一步提升其效果。在密集到密集任务和非视觉领域也表现良好。

Conclusion: SIM是一个模型无关、任务无关的即插即用正则化模块，能有效增强表示学习能力，在各种任务和架构中都有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and
mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on
heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We
propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic
regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance
representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed
output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates
smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate
SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and
projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering
complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be
seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to
different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image
classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization.
Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods,
highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning
across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal
to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our
results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic
information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic
segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including
audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.

*Zhanting Zhou,Jinbo Wang,Zeqin Wu,Fengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIA是一种基于动量的自适应梯度反演攻击方法，能够在单轮平均梯度SAG机制下实现高保真多图像重建，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在具有挑战性的单轮平均梯度SAG机制下的梯度反演问题，其中每个样本的线索都纠缠在单个批次平均梯度中。

Method: MAGIA框架包含两个核心创新：1）闭式组合重缩放，创建可证明更紧的优化边界；2）基于动量的整体批次和子集损失混合，确保重建鲁棒性。该方法通过探测随机数据子集来感知潜在的单图像信号。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAGIA在大型批次场景下显著优于先进方法，实现了高保真多图像重建，而现有方法在此类场景下失败。

Conclusion: MAGIA在计算开销与标准求解器相当且无需任何辅助信息的情况下，成功解决了单轮平均梯度SAG机制下的梯度反演挑战。

Abstract: We study gradient inversion in the challenging single round averaged gradient
SAG regime where per sample cues are entangled within a single batch mean
gradient. We introduce MAGIA a momentum based adaptive correction on gradient
inversion attack a novel label inference free framework that senses latent per
image signals by probing random data subsets. MAGIA objective integrates two
core innovations 1 a closed form combinatorial rescaling that creates a
provably tighter optimization bound and 2 a momentum based mixing of whole
batch and subset losses to ensure reconstruction robustness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MAGIA significantly outperforms advanced methods
achieving high fidelity multi image reconstruction in large batch scenarios
where prior works fail. This is all accomplished with a computational footprint
comparable to standard solvers and without requiring any auxiliary information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Baseer是一个专门针对阿拉伯文档OCR的视觉语言模型，通过大规模数据集和解码器微调策略，在阿拉伯文档OCR任务上显著优于现有解决方案，WER达到0.25，创下新的SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯文档OCR由于草书字体、多样化字体、变音符号和从右到左的书写方向而具有挑战性。现有的多模态大语言模型在高资源语言上表现良好，但在阿拉伯语上性能有限。

Method: 使用结合合成和真实世界文档的大规模数据集，采用解码器微调策略对预训练的MLLM进行适配，同时保留通用视觉特征。还提出了Misraj-DocOCR基准用于严格评估。

Result: Baseer显著优于现有的开源和商业解决方案，WER达到0.25，在阿拉伯文档OCR领域建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了针对特定领域适配通用MLLM的益处，并为形态丰富的语言（如阿拉伯语）的高精度OCR建立了强大的基准。

Abstract: Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive
script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding
for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In
this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned
specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset
combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a
decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving
general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality,
expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR
systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing
open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing
a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results
highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs
and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich
languages like Arabic.

### [6] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18176)
*Wendong Yao,Saeed Azadnejad,Binhua Huang,Shane Donohue,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度学习框架，将稀疏的InSAR时间序列数据转换为密集的时空张量，用于地面变形预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从稀疏的InSAR时间序列数据预测未来地面变形具有挑战性，现有方法难以有效处理

Method: 设计了混合CNN-LSTM模型，同时学习空间模式和时间依赖关系，并与LightGBM和LASSO回归进行基准测试

Result: 提出的架构提供了更准确和空间一致的预测，建立了新的性能基准

Conclusion: 时空深度学习在高分辨率变形预测中具有有效性和潜力

Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability
and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from
sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning
framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense
spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time,
the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this
forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural
Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to
simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the
generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful
machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO
regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate
that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and
spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this
task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models
often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of
our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of
ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of
spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出一种自蒸馏框架，将视频扩散模型中的隐式3D知识蒸馏到显式的3D高斯溅射表示中，无需多视角训练数据即可生成静态和动态3D场景


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的3D重建方法依赖真实世界多视角数据，但这些数据不易获得。视频扩散模型具有强大的想象力，但其2D特性限制了在机器人导航等需要3D环境交互的应用

Method: 在典型RGB解码器基础上增加3D高斯溅射解码器，通过RGB解码器的输出进行监督训练。3DGS解码器可完全使用视频扩散模型生成的合成数据进行训练

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在静态和动态3D场景生成方面达到了最先进的性能，能够从文本提示或单张图像实时渲染3D场景

Conclusion: 提出的自蒸馏框架成功地将视频扩散模型的2D想象力转化为3D表示，为物理AI应用提供了无需真实多视角数据的3D场景生成解决方案

Abstract: The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications
ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods
rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not
always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have
shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the
applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with
the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that
aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an
explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for
multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with
a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this
approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated
by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D
scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our
framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input
video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

### [8] [A Framework for Generating Artificial Datasets to Validate Absolute and Relative Position Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18177)
*George Corrêa de Araújo,Helena de Almeida Maia,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Scrapbook框架，用于生成大规模数据集来测试AI模型对基本概念（如物体识别、位置关系、属性识别）的理解能力。实验发现当前模型在物体识别方面表现良好，但在位置理解和约束性问题上存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了系统性地评估AI模型对基本概念的理解能力，需要生成包含大量问题和语言变体的数据集，以验证模型在应对复杂任务前对这些基础元素的掌握程度。

Method: 开发Scrapbook框架，通过生成包含个体概念的大量问题和广泛语言变体的数据集，重点关注物体识别、绝对和相对位置、属性识别等基本概念。

Result: 当代模型在物体识别和枚举方面表现熟练，但在理解位置信息和处理有额外约束的问题时遇到挑战。MobileVLM-V2模型显示出显著的答案不一致性，其他模型则表现出肯定答案偏见，在几何形状和位置信息问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Scrapbook框架为生成多样化和全面数据集提供了有价值的工具，可用于系统评估和提升AI模型的性能，特别是在位置理解和一致性方面需要改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology
designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of
artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental
concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and
attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of
questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the
Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic
elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal
that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and
enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional
information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically,
the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible
wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers
and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional
information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency.
The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and
comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and
enhance the performance of AI models.

*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过实证分析量化了视觉-语言-视觉管道中描述-生成瓶颈造成的信息损失，发现99.3%的样本存在显著的感知退化，91.5%存在显著结构信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态AI系统在创意工作流程中的集成日益增加，理解视觉-语言-视觉管道中的信息损失对于评估系统局限性变得重要，但目前通过文本中介传递视觉内容时的退化程度缺乏量化研究。

Method: 生成了150对通过描述-生成管道的图像对，应用现有指标（LPIPS、SSIM和色彩距离）来测量感知、结构和色彩维度上的信息保存情况。

Result: 评估显示99.3%的样本表现出显著的感知退化，91.5%的样本表现出显著的结构信息损失。

Conclusion: 描述-生成瓶颈代表了当代多模态系统中可测量且一致的限制，为系统改进提供了实证基础。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of multimodal AI systems in creative
workflows, understanding information loss in vision-language-vision pipelines
has become important for evaluating system limitations. However, the
degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual
intermediation remains poorly quantified. In this work, we provide empirical
analysis of the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language
serves as an intermediate representation for visual information. We generated
150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied
existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information
preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our
evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual
degradation and 91.5% demonstrate significant structural information loss,
providing empirical evidence that the describe-then-generate bottleneck
represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个AI驱动的工作流程，利用高分辨率卫星图像自动推断屋顶属性，旨在解决小岛屿发展中国家建筑结构信息缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多气候脆弱地区（如加勒比海的小岛屿发展中国家）缺乏详细的建筑结构信息，这限制了城市韧性规划和灾害风险评估的能力。

Method: 比较了地理空间基础模型结合浅层分类器与微调深度学习模型在屋顶分类中的效果，并评估了引入邻近岛屿训练数据对模型性能的影响。

Result: 最佳模型在屋顶坡度和屋顶材料分类上分别达到了0.88和0.83的F1分数。

Conclusion: 结合本地能力建设，该研究为小岛屿发展中国家提供了利用AI和地球观测数据实现更高效、基于证据的城市治理的新能力。

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage
from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical
for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such
information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS)
in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we
present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from
high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our
case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models
combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for
rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating
additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance.
Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof
material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building,
our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth
Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban
governance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VLA-LPAF轻量级模块，通过2D数据增强VLA模型的多视角适应性，有效解决视觉观察视角不一致问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在训练时使用的第三方全局视角和手腕局部视角的视觉观察数据存在视角差异，这种视角异质性限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出VLA-LPAF模块，使用单视角图像进行微调，在潜在空间中融合多视角观察，有效弥合视角不一致造成的差距。基于RoboFlamingo模型构建RoboFlamingo-LPAF实例。

Conclusion: VLA-LPAF能够有效提升VLA模型的多视角适应能力，仅使用2D数据即可实现显著的性能提升，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models can follow text instructions
according to visual observations of the surrounding environment. This ability
to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA
model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured
by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in
number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant
differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains
the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the
lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models
using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and
fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and
efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate
our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct
RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves
around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a
customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive
characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.

In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware refinement network called URNet
for event-based stereo depth estimation. Our approach features a local-global
refinement module that effectively captures fine-grained local details and
long-range global context. Additionally, we introduce a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence-based uncertainty modeling method to enhance prediction reliability.
Extensive experiments on the DSEC dataset demonstrate that URNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations.

Method: 采用两阶段混合AI框架：(A)使用深度学习模型自动分割解剖结构，(B)通过符号空间推理进行纤维束成像和神经识别，利用模糊空间关系编码解剖知识。

Result: 在10名子宫内膜异位症患者中应用，相比标准纤维束成像，Dice分数提高达25%，空间误差减少到小于5mm。

Conclusion: 这种自动且可重复的方法能够进行详细的神经分析，为非侵入性诊断子宫内膜异位症相关神经病变及其他神经受累疾病铺平了道路。

Abstract: Endometriosis often leads to chronic pelvic pain and possible nerve
involvement, yet imaging the peripheral nerves remains a challenge. We
introduce Visionerves, a novel hybrid AI framework for peripheral nervous
system recognition from multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. Unlike
conventional tractography, Visionerves encodes anatomical knowledge through
fuzzy spatial relationships, removing the need for selection of manual ROIs.
The pipeline comprises two phases: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical
structures using a deep learning model, and (B) tractography and nerve
recognition by symbolic spatial reasoning. Applied to the lumbosacral plexus in
10 women with (confirmed or suspected) endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated
substantial improvements over standard tractography, with Dice score
improvements of up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5 mm. This
automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and paves
the way for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy, as well
as other conditions with nerve involvement.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge, particularly
in countries with heterogeneous road conditions, mixed traffic flow, and
variable driving discipline, such as Pakistan. Reliable detection of unsafe
driving behaviours is a prerequisite for improving road safety, enabling
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and supporting data driven decisions
in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the
developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity
observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the
privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving
multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani
driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS
sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving
behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads,
including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered
using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency
accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all
sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this
work is on the data acquisition process, covering participant selection,
driving scenarios, environmental considerations, and sensor video
synchronization techniques. The dataset is structured into raw, processed, and
semantic layers, ensuring adaptability for future research in driver behaviour
classification, traffic safety analysis, and ADAS development. By representing
real world driving in Pakistan, V-SenseDrive fills a critical gap in the global
landscape of driver behaviour datasets and lays the groundwork for context
aware intelligent transportation solutions.

TL;DR: HazeFlow是一个基于ODE的去雾框架，将大气散射模型重新表述为常微分方程，通过单步推理实现真实世界图像去雾，并利用马尔可夫链布朗运动生成非均匀雾霾数据来缓解训练数据不足问题。

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法因缺乏配对的真实世界训练数据和领域差距，在真实场景去雾中泛化能力不足。传统基于大气散射模型的物理方法难以处理真实世界的复杂雾霾模式。

Method: 提出HazeFlow框架，将大气散射模型重新表述为ODE，学习从雾霾图像到清晰图像的最优ODE轨迹。引入基于马尔可夫链布朗运动的非均匀雾霾生成方法，模拟真实雾霾模式。

Result: 在多个真实世界去雾基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: HazeFlow通过ODE框架和真实雾霾模拟方法，有效解决了真实世界图像去雾的挑战，展示了优越的性能。

Abstract: Dehazing involves removing haze or fog from images to restore clarity and
improve visibility by estimating atmospheric scattering effects. While deep
learning methods show promise, the lack of paired real-world training data and
the resulting domain gap hinder generalization to real-world scenarios. In this
context, physics-grounded learning becomes crucial; however, traditional
methods based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) often fall short in
handling real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns. To solve this
problem, we propose HazeFlow, a novel ODE-based framework that reformulates ASM
as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Inspired by Rectified Flow (RF),
HazeFlow learns an optimal ODE trajectory to map hazy images to clean ones,
enhancing real-world dehazing performance with only a single inference step.
Additionally, we introduce a non-homogeneous haze generation method using
Markov Chain Brownian Motion (MCBM) to address the scarcity of paired
real-world data. By simulating realistic haze patterns through MCBM, we enhance
the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

Abstract: As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning
models are expected to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while
remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel
multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and
contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality
imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens
for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional
unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We
validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection
and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a
single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through
successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings
highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach
for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with
significant potential for real-world clinical applications. The code is

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了9种分割架构在肺栓塞分割任务中的表现，发现3D U-Net with ResNet编码器效果最佳，CNN模型优于ViT模型，分类预训练可能损害分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺栓塞分割对临床诊断至关重要，但现有研究缺乏对不同分割架构在统一框架下的系统性比较。本研究旨在填补这一空白，为肺栓塞分割提供性能基准。

Method: 使用490个CTPA扫描构建内部数据集，在统一测试框架下评估9种分割架构（包括CNN和ViT），比较预训练与随机初始化的效果。

Result: 最佳模型达到平均Dice分数0.7131，在60个测试扫描中检测到181个栓子，有49个假阳性和28个假阴性。3D模型和CNN架构表现优于2D和ViT模型。

Conclusion: 3D U-Net with ResNet是肺栓塞分割的有效架构，远端栓子分割仍具挑战性，分类预训练可能不利于分割任务，不同模型在相同数据上表现一致。

Abstract: In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490
CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used
segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)
families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified
testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important
observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective
architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to
this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based
models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based
counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on
large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to
training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may
rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model
architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when
trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be
segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to
both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these
findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for
segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false
negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further
validated on public datasets.

Abstract: Handshapes serve a fundamental phonological role in signed languages, with
American Sign Language employing approximately 50 distinct shapes.
However,computational approaches rarely model handshapes explicitly, limiting
both recognition accuracy and linguistic analysis.We introduce a novel graph

configurations. Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures
with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition,
including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish
the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences,
achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods
achieving 25%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了在胎儿超声图像中，分类任务本身对OOD检测性能的影响，发现不同分类任务会导致OOD检测性能显著差异，且最佳任务取决于ID-OOD标准（图像特征偏移或解剖特征偏移）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的OOD检测对于在异质性图像特征和临床环境中安全部署深度学习模型至关重要。现有研究主要关注不确定性量化方法，但本文关注分类任务本身对OOD检测的影响。

Method: 通过实验使用八种不确定性量化方法，在四个分类任务上进行测试，分析不同任务对OOD检测性能的影响。

Result: 研究表明OOD检测性能随任务显著变化，最佳任务取决于ID-OOD标准（图像特征偏移或解剖特征偏移），且优越的OOD检测性能并不保证最优的弃权预测。

Conclusion: 在医学图像分析中，需要将任务选择和不确定性策略与特定下游应用对齐，以实现最佳性能。

Abstract: Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment
of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image
characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a
classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples.
While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification
methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself.
Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four
classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance
significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the
defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an
image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we
reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained
prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty
strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉定位系统在资源受限场景下（无网络连接或GPS支持）难以使用大型图像数据库或重型3D模型，而正射地理数据轻量且易获取，但相关研究较少

Method: 创建包含16,425张无人机图像的多模态数据集，提出AdHoP优化技术可集成到任何特征匹配器中，通过解耦图像检索和特征匹配实现公平评估

Conclusion: OrthoLoC为基于正射地理数据的视觉定位提供了首个大规模基准，AdHoP技术显著提升了定位精度，推动了该领域的发展

Abstract: Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with
applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue
operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision
localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet
connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D
models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging
orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and
increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g.,
the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first
large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United
States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between
UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking
of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching,
allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance.
Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data
resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a
refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature
matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up
to 63%. The dataset and code are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中缺乏训练数据的零样本异常检测问题，利用自然图像具有统一纹理和模式的特性。

Method: 基于深度图像先验的patch训练框架，通过掩码、patch打乱和噪声避免恒等映射，使用感知损失捕获结构信息。

Result: 在MVTec-AD上达到0.99 AUROC和0.60 AUPRC，在fabric数据集上达到0.98 AUROC和0.67 AUPRC，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSDnet无需外部数据即可有效进行异常定位，对噪声和缺失像素具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from
collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many
real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only
the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by
proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the
inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior
(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key
assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,
and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or
stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based
training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for
self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in
DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,
patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual
loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel
fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,
and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves
0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the
fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code
will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对低资源孟加拉语的视觉-语言模型，通过三重损失函数（PAL+InfoNCE+OT）改善图像描述生成中的对象定位问题，在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如孟加拉语）视觉-语言模型中的对象定位错误问题，这些问题源于配对数据稀缺、翻译对齐断裂以及英语中心预训练忽略目标语言语义。

Method: 使用计算感知的孟加拉语描述生成流程：冻结的MaxViT提取视觉特征，孟加拉语原生mBART-50解码，轻量级桥接模块连接模态。核心创新是三重损失目标：PAL损失对齐真实和合成图像块描述符，InfoNCE强制全局真实-合成分离，基于Sinkhorn的最优传输确保细粒度块对应平衡。

Result: 在Flickr30k-1k上达到BLEU-4 12.29、METEOR 27.98、BERTScore-F1 71.20；在MSCOCO-1k上达到BLEU-4 12.00、METEOR 28.14、BERTScore-F1 75.40，优于强CE基线，并将真实-合成质心差距缩小41%。

Conclusion: PAL+InfoNCE+OT三重损失协同作用有效改善了对象定位，减少了虚假匹配，为低资源语言的视觉-语言建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains
challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This
stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and
English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address
this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified
EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT
yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a
lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss
objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch
descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global
real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained
patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces
spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR
27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14,

Abstract: We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework
that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher
(UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient
camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the
complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting,
occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined
28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD
[19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines
feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to
effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV
representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08
minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x
faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that
full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained
settings, bridging the gap between large-scale, multi-modal perception-planning
models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标注方法将球标记在模糊前缘，存在不对称性且忽略了与速度相关的运动线索，这限制了球体检测系统的性能，特别是在球拍运动中球常呈现为条纹而非清晰点。

Method: 提出中心标注策略，将球标注在模糊条纹中心并显式标注模糊属性；开发BlurBall模型，通过多帧输入的Squeeze-and-Excitation注意力机制联合估计球位置和运动模糊属性。

Result: 新标注策略显著提升了各种模型的检测性能；BlurBall模型在球体检测方面达到了最先进的结果，同时实现了更可靠的轨迹预测。

Conclusion: 利用运动模糊信息不仅提高了检测精度，还增强了轨迹预测的可靠性，为实时体育分析提供了重要价值。

Abstract: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for
detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as
streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the
ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring
valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new
labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and
explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new
table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach
consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore,
we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion
blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as
Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy
but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time
sports analytics.

Conclusion: 压缩域传播是减少检测器调用同时保持强大零样本覆盖能力的实用方法

Abstract: Running a large open-vocabulary (Open-vocab) detector on every video frame is
accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes
OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to
intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3
grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale
updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class
switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt
list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset),
our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise
OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse
localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP
outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A
supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled
training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These
results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to
reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

*Zitian Zhang,Joshua Urban Davis,Jeanne Phuong Anh Vu,Jiangtao Kuang,Jean-François Lalonde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了HDR光照估计方法的颜色鲁棒性，提出使用预训练的白平衡网络预处理输入图像来提升现有模型在颜色准确性方面的表现，无需重新训练光照估计模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的HDR光照估计方法在颜色鲁棒性方面存在不足，颜色准确性对于实现逼真的增强现实渲染至关重要，但这一因素往往被忽视。

Method: 使用包含多样化光照颜色的新型HDR数据集，系统评估多种适应策略，重点研究预训练白平衡网络预处理输入图像的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用预训练白平衡网络预处理输入图像的方法在所有测试场景中都优于其他策略，显著提升了颜色鲁棒性。

Abstract: Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image
have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications.
Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for
the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we
investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet
critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate
color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate
color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new
lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques
can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset
featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several
adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with
a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming
other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires
no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the
generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art
lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

Motivation: 支票作为金融基础工具面临欺诈风险，传统检测方法依赖大量标注数据，但这类数据因隐私和专有问题而稀缺

Method: 结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和多模态大语言模型(MLLM)，开发无需训练的自动化支票字段检测框架，支持零样本检测签名、MICR线、金额等关键字段

Result: 在包含110张不同格式支票的手工数据集上评估，显示出强大的性能和泛化能力

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能有效检测支票字段，还可作为生成高质量标注数据的引导机制，为开发专用实时目标检测模型奠定基础

Abstract: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem,
facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However,
their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud,
underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the
core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of
critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition
(MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are
essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the
same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object
detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets,
a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this
paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field
detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction
with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot
detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment
in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a
hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts
demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore,
this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality
labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object
detection models tailored to institutional needs.

TL;DR: 本文评估了视觉语言模型在图表理解中的鲁棒性，发现模型在面对失真或遮挡的图表时性能显著下降，并出现幻觉问题。作者提出了CHART NOISe数据集来测试模型在噪声和遮挡条件下的表现，并提出了基线缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图表理解基准假设图表清晰且查询基于事实，但现实世界中的图表常包含失真，需要超越简单匹配的推理能力。本文旨在评估当前最先进的视觉语言模型在退化条件下的表现。

Method: 评估了ChatGPT 4o、Claude Sonnet 4和Gemini 2.5 Pro在图表失真和遮挡条件下的表现，引入了CHART NOISe数据集，该数据集结合了图表失真、遮挡和考试风格的多选题，并提出了提示反向不一致性测试。

Result: 模型在图表失真或遮挡条件下性能急剧下降，幻觉问题（如数值捏造、趋势误解和实体混淆）更加频繁。模型在退化设置下仍过度自信，生成看似合理但无支持的解释。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了视觉语言模型在图表推理中的系统性脆弱性，提出了首个统一失真、遮挡和反向不一致性的数据集，并建立了推进图表理解鲁棒性和可靠性的严格测试平台。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet
existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world
charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching.
We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp
performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as
value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more
frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating
plausible but unsupported explanations.
  To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers,
and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset
combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice
questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt
reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm
versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in
chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying
corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline
mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection.
Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness
and reliability in chart understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经表示的4D-MRI重建方法，用连续变形模型替代传统的离散相位分箱方法，通过两个协同网络实现高效准确的呼吸运动捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4D-MRI重建方法依赖相位分箱或独立模板扫描，难以捕捉时间变异性，工作流程复杂且计算负担重。

Method: 使用空间解剖网络(SAN)编码连续3D解剖表示，时序运动网络(TMN)基于Transformer生成的呼吸信号产生时间一致的变形场，将运动建模与图像重建融合。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了任意呼吸状态下3D图像的准确重建，性能优于传统方法，在4D放射治疗规划和实时自适应治疗中具有强大应用潜力。

Abstract: Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing
respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery.
Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning
or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability,
complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a
neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth,
continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing
the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion
modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the
Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical
representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by
Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent
deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers
demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both
regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and
bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method
significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from
approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to
just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D
volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at
any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional
methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation
therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

*Prithvi Raj Singh,Raju Gottumukkala,Anthony Maida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了五种基于卡尔曼滤波的跟踪方法在快速移动微小物体（如壁球）跟踪中的性能，发现DeepOCSORT在跟踪精度上表现最佳，但所有方法都存在显著的跟踪漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速移动微小物体的精确跟踪是计算机视觉中的挑战性问题，特别是在体育机器人应用中。现有卡尔曼滤波方法在处理具有不规则弹跳行为的快速移动物体时性能显著下降。

Method: 使用包含10,000个标注壁球帧的自定义数据集，评估了OCSORT、DeepOCSORT、ByteTrack、BoTSORT和StrongSORT五种跟踪方法，重点分析推理速度和每图像更新频率对跟踪精度的影响。

Result: DeepOCSORT实现了最低的跟踪误差（平均ADE为31.15像素），而ByteTrack处理速度最快（平均推理时间26.6ms）。所有跟踪器都表现出显著的跟踪漂移，空间误差范围3-11cm。

Conclusion: 当前跟踪方法在处理快速移动微小物体时存在根本性局限，误差率比标准物体跟踪基准高3-4倍，需要开发专门的方法论来解决此类应用需求。

Abstract: Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking
of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems
in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics
applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot
perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking
methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their
performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects
that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking
methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom
dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p
resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors:
inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters
affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our
experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT
achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared
to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest
processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms.
However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit
significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values:
31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the
unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs.
Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial
improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking
benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving
tiny object tracking applications.

TL;DR: MoCrop是一种基于运动感知的自适应裁剪模块，用于压缩域中的高效视频动作识别，通过利用H.264视频中的运动向量来定位运动密集区域，无需训练即可提升识别精度或降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频动作识别方法在压缩域中效率不高，需要处理大量数据。MoCrop旨在通过利用视频压缩中已有的运动向量信息，实现高效的动作识别，减少计算开销。

Method: MoCrop包含去噪与合并(DM)、蒙特卡洛采样(MCS)和自适应裁剪(AC)三个轻量级步骤，通过运动密度子矩阵搜索生成鲁棒的裁剪区域，该模块无需训练，可嵌入多种骨干网络。

Result: 在UCF101数据集上，MoCrop在ResNet-50上实现了+3.5%的Top-1精度提升（同等计算量下），或在减少26.5%FLOPs的情况下提升+2.4%精度。在CoViAR上达到89.2%精度（原计算成本）和88.5%精度（计算量从11.6降至8.5 GFLOPs）。

Conclusion: MoCrop在多种骨干网络（MobileNet-V3、EfficientNet-B1、Swin-B）上均表现出良好的通用性，证明了其在压缩域实时部署的实用性。

Abstract: We introduce MoCrop, a motion-aware adaptive cropping module for efficient
video action recognition in the compressed domain. MoCrop uses motion vectors
that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a
single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module
is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse
backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte
Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix
search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves
accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy
at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer
FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy
at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6
to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B
indicate strong generality and make MoCrop practical for real-time deployment
in the compressed domain. Our code and models are available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在低比特率条件下性能较差，因为它们保留了过多冗余细节或学习过度集中的符号分布

Method: 使用向量量化将连续视觉特征映射到离散索引，通过码本选择性传输特征，保留更多信息性视觉模式

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在速率和准确性方面具有优越性

Conclusion: CAFC-SE框架对低比特率条件具有更强的鲁棒性，能够有效提升边缘-云系统的分析性能

Abstract: Coding images for machines with minimal bitrate and strong analysis
performance is key to effective edge-cloud systems. Several approaches deploy
an image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods
compress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform
analysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform
poorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or
learn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a
Codebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic
Enhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete
indices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and
selectively transmits them to the cloud. The VQ operation that projects feature
vectors onto the nearest visual primitives enables us to preserve more
informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. Hence, CAFC-SE is
less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method in terms of rate and accuracy.

Motivation: 针对资源受限环境（如即时诊断设备）需要实时、高保真医学图像分割的需求，开发一种计算效率高但性能优越的轻量级分割网络。

Method: 设计了多核深度卷积块（MKDC）来处理多分辨率空间关系，并采用通道、空间和分组门控注意力机制来强调图像显著特征。

Result: MK-UNet在DICE分数上超越TransUNet，同时参数减少333倍，FLOPs减少123倍；相比UNeXt，DICE分数提升高达6.7%，参数减少4.7倍；在多个轻量级网络中表现最优。

Conclusion: MK-UNet在计算效率和分割精度之间取得了卓越平衡，为资源受限环境下的实时医学诊断提供了无与伦比的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MK-UNet, a paradigm shift towards
ultra-lightweight, multi-kernel U-shaped CNNs tailored for medical image
segmentation. Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution
block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels,
while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also
emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention
mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our
MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M
parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but
also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy
over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging
benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with
nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively.
Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation
performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with
4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent
lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with
much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with
drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for
real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such
as point-of-care devices. Our implementation is available at

Abstract: Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of
remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how
to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is
inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.
Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many
high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.
Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more
supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain
substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This
limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus
restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel
pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment
(DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and
propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality
of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on
confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which
utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a
small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage
the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular
distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed
noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby
generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively
avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,
significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the
model's performance in the target domain.

Conclusion: 双曲空间嵌入为C2FSCIL任务提供了有效的解决方案，通过双曲对比学习和特征增强技术显著提升了模型在少样本条件下的性能。

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior
representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional
Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot
Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe
approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently
normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the
embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose
embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ
the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor
to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball
instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss
and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and
classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under
few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic
space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors.
This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate
overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL
benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class
accuracies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种几何感知的两阶段框架GeoRemover，用于智能图像编辑中的物体移除，能够同时移除目标物体及其因果视觉伪影（如阴影和反射）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像外观的方法要么严格遵循掩码对齐训练，无法移除未明确掩码的因果效应；要么采用松散掩码对齐策略，缺乏可控性且可能过度擦除其他物体。这些限制源于忽略了物体几何存在与其视觉效应之间的因果关系。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）几何移除阶段，使用严格掩码对齐监督直接从几何（如深度）中移除物体；2）外观渲染阶段，基于更新后的几何条件渲染逼真RGB图像。引入基于正负样本对的偏好驱动目标来指导几何移除学习。

Result: 在两个流行基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在移除物体及其相关伪影方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦几何移除和外观渲染，该方法能够有效处理物体移除中的因果视觉效应问题，同时保持结构感知编辑的强几何约束。

Abstract: Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the
target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections.
However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly
mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not
explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack
controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify
that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an
object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,
we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal
into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we
remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly
mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong
geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB
image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are
considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide
learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven
objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to
remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new
structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their
associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks. The code is available at

*Yujia Liu,Dingquan Li,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了SEGA方法，通过高斯平滑和梯度集成来提高无参考图像质量评估模型的黑盒攻击迁移性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NR-IQA模型白盒攻击方法在更现实的黑盒场景下迁移性较差，无法有效攻击未知目标模型

Method: SEGA方法通过高斯平滑源模型的梯度并集成这些平滑梯度来近似目标模型的梯度，同时使用扰动过滤掩码确保对抗性扰动的不可感知性

Result: 在CLIVE数据集上的实验结果表明SEGA具有优越的迁移性，能够成功实现对NR-IQA模型的基于迁移的黑盒攻击

Conclusion: SEGA是首个解决NR-IQA模型攻击低迁移性挑战的方法，为揭示模型脆弱性和指导鲁棒系统设计提供了有效工具

Abstract: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models play an important role
in various real-world applications. Recently, adversarial attacks against
NR-IQA models have attracted increasing attention, as they provide valuable
insights for revealing model vulnerabilities and guiding robust system design.
Some effective attacks have been proposed against NR-IQA models in white-box
settings, where the attacker has full access to the target model. However,
these attacks often suffer from poor transferability to unknown target models
in more realistic black-box scenarios, where the target model is inaccessible.
This work makes the first attempt to address the challenge of low
transferability in attacking NR-IQA models by proposing a transferable Signed
Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA). The main idea is to approximate the
gradient of the target model by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models
and ensembling their smoothed gradients. To ensure the imperceptibility of
adversarial perturbations, SEGA further removes inappropriate perturbations
using a specially designed perturbation filter mask. Experimental results on
the CLIVE dataset demonstrate the superior transferability of SEGA, validating
its effectiveness in enabling successful transfer-based black-box attacks
against NR-IQA models.

*Mohammad Junayed Hasan,Nabeel Mohammed,Shafin Rahman,Philipp Koehn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaSmileNet是一个新颖的特征融合框架，通过参数自由的Hadamard乘法交互直接集成基于transformer的表征和生理学基础的D-Markers，在微笑表情识别任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多任务学习框架在微笑表情识别中的计算效率低下问题，这些方法由于辅助任务监督和复杂的损失平衡要求而效率不高。

Method: 提出HadaSmileNet框架，系统评估了15种融合策略，发现Hadamard乘法融合通过直接特征交互实现最优性能，同时保持计算效率。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上取得新SOTA结果：UvA-NEMO（88.7%，+0.8）、MMI（99.7%）、SPOS（98.5%，+0.7）和BBC（100%，+5.0）。计算分析显示参数减少26%，训练简化。

Conclusion: 该框架的效率和有效性使其特别适合需要实时情感计算能力的多媒体数据挖掘应用的实际部署。

Abstract: The distinction between genuine and posed emotions represents a fundamental
pattern recognition challenge with significant implications for data mining
applications in social sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.
While recent multi-task learning frameworks have shown promise in combining
deep learning architectures with handcrafted D-Marker features for smile facial
emotion recognition, these approaches exhibit computational inefficiencies due
to auxiliary task supervision and complex loss balancing requirements. This
paper introduces HadaSmileNet, a novel feature fusion framework that directly
integrates transformer-based representations with physiologically grounded
D-Markers through parameter-free multiplicative interactions. Through
systematic evaluation of 15 fusion strategies, we demonstrate that Hadamard
multiplicative fusion achieves optimal performance by enabling direct feature
interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach
establishes new state-of-the-art results for deep learning methods across four
benchmark datasets: UvA-NEMO (88.7 percent, +0.8), MMI (99.7 percent), SPOS
(98.5 percent, +0.7), and BBC (100 percent, +5.0). Comprehensive computational
analysis reveals 26 percent parameter reduction and simplified training
compared to multi-task alternatives, while feature visualization demonstrates
enhanced discriminative power through direct domain knowledge integration. The
framework's efficiency and effectiveness make it particularly suitable for
practical deployment in multimedia data mining applications that require
real-time affective computing capabilities.

*Xiaoting Yin,Hao Shi,Kailun Yang,Jiajun Zhai,Shangwei Guo,Lin Wang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机和3D高斯泼溅的联合动态人体与静态场景重建框架，在快速运动场景下显著提升重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目视频中动态人体与静态场景联合重建的难题，特别是在快速运动导致RGB图像模糊的情况下。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率的优势，更适合动态重建任务。

Method: 使用统一的3D高斯集合，通过学习语义属性区分人体和场景高斯。仅人体高斯进行形变动画，场景高斯保持静态。提出事件引导损失函数，通过匹配连续渲染的亮度变化与事件流来对抗模糊。

Result: 在两个基准数据集ZJU-MoCap-Blur和MMHPSD-Blur上实现了最先进的人体-场景重建效果，在PSNR/SSIM指标上显著优于基线方法，LPIPS指标降低，尤其对高速运动主体效果明显。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部人体掩码，简化了高斯集合管理，证明了事件相机在动态人体重建中的有效性，为快速运动场景下的高质量重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans together with static scenes from monocular
videos remains difficult, especially under fast motion, where RGB frames suffer
from motion blur. Event cameras exhibit distinct advantages, e.g., microsecond
temporal resolution, making them a superior sensing choice for dynamic human
reconstruction. Accordingly, we present a novel event-guided human-scene
reconstruction framework that jointly models human and scene from a single
monocular event camera via 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, a unified set
of 3D Gaussians carries a learnable semantic attribute; only Gaussians
classified as human undergo deformation for animation, while scene Gaussians
stay static. To combat blur, we propose an event-guided loss that matches
simulated brightness changes between consecutive renderings with the event
stream, improving local fidelity in fast-moving regions. Our approach removes
the need for external human masks and simplifies managing separate Gaussian
sets. On two benchmark datasets, ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur, it delivers
state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction, with notable gains over strong
baselines in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Live-E2T是一个实时威胁监控框架，通过结构化语义元组、在线事件去重和基于LLM的推理机制，同时实现高性能的实时威胁检测和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时满足实时性能和决策可解释性的要求，需要一种统一框架来解决这一挑战。

Method: 1. 将视频帧解构为结构化的人-物-交互-地点语义元组；2. 提出高效的在线事件去重和更新机制；3. 使用思维链策略微调大语言模型进行透明推理。

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime基准数据集上的实验表明，Live-E2T在威胁检测精度、实时效率和可解释性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Live-E2T成功统一了实时性能和可解释性目标，为实时威胁监控提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams
and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory
text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning
or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding
requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two
objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video
frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This
approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing
the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second,
an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to
filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time
responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a
Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and
logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment
reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and
UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the
crucial dimension of explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在美学视觉理解方面存在显著不足，主要局限于基础美学常识，无法满足真实场景中需要专业摄影知识（如摄影技巧、前后期处理等）的详细美学分析需求。

Method: 1) 构建基于专业摄影师讨论的大规模专业数据集PhotoCritique；2) 提出PhotoEye模型，采用语言引导的多视角视觉融合机制从多个角度理解图像美学；3) 建立全面的专业基准PhotoBench。

Result: 在现有基准和PhotoBench上，PhotoEye模型相比现有模型展现出明显优势，能够更好地进行专业美学分析。

Conclusion: 通过专业数据集、创新模型和全面基准的协同作用，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在美学视觉理解方面的能力，填补了通用视觉理解与美学视觉理解之间的重要差距。

Abstract: While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult
to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator,
Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and
aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the
factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object
identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color
block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection,
localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual
understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they
are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they
frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive
expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing
knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To
fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce
a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among
professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large
scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from
PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a
languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image
aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark,
PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual
understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates
clear advantages over existing models.

Method: 利用XMem模型的内存增强架构，在有限的标注数据下实现实时肿瘤分割和运动追踪。

Result: 由于实验记录丢失，无法报告精确量化结果，但初步印象显示框架具有合理的分割性能并满足临床实时要求。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于改善MRI引导放疗中的肿瘤追踪精度，为癌症治疗提供更准确和安全的技术支持。

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced tumor segmentation framework for real-time
MRI-guided radiotherapy, designed for the TrackRAD2025 challenge. Our method
leverages the XMem model, a memory-augmented architecture, to segment tumors
across long cine-MRI sequences. The proposed system efficiently integrates
memory mechanisms to track tumor motion in real-time, achieving high
segmentation accuracy even under challenging conditions with limited annotated
data. Unfortunately, the detailed experimental records have been lost,
preventing us from reporting precise quantitative results at this stage.
Nevertheless, From our preliminary impressions during development, the
XMem-based framework demonstrated reasonable segmentation performance and
satisfied the clinical real-time requirement. Our work contributes to improving
the precision of tumor tracking during MRI-guided radiotherapy, which is
crucial for enhancing the accuracy and safety of cancer treatments.

TL;DR: 提出SSCM模型解决多对比度MRI超分辨率问题，通过动态空间扭曲、语义感知标记聚合和空间-频率融合模块，实现空间语义一致性重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在空间语义一致性建模不足且未充分利用频域信息，导致细粒度对齐差和高频细节恢复不足

Method: SSCM模型包含动态空间扭曲模块（跨对比度空间对齐）、语义感知标记聚合块（长程语义一致性）和空间-频率融合块（精细结构恢复）

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，SSCM以更少参数实现最先进性能，确保空间和语义一致的重建

Conclusion: SSCM能有效缩短MRI采集时间，提高成像效率，同时保持解剖细节的空间语义一致性

Abstract: Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) aims
to enhance low-resolution (LR) contrasts leveraging high-resolution (HR)
references, shortening acquisition time and improving imaging efficiency while
preserving anatomical details. The main challenge lies in maintaining
spatial-semantic consistency, ensuring anatomical structures remain
well-aligned and coherent despite structural discrepancies and motion between
the target and reference images. Conventional methods insufficiently model
spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, which
leads to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency
details. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model
(SSCM), which integrates a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast
spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range
semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure
restoration. Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and
semantically consistent reconstructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有放射学报告生成方法对大规模数据和计算资源的依赖问题，在预算受限条件下实现高效训练

Method: 使用Oracle-educated GRPO (OraPO)框架进行单阶段强化学习训练，结合FactScore奖励机制提取临床事实并与真实标签进行蕴含检查

Result: 在CheXpert Plus数据集上达到0.341 F1分数的新SOTA性能，训练数据减少2-3个数量级，使用小型基础视觉语言模型在普通硬件上实现

Conclusion: OraPO和FactS构建了一个紧凑而强大的框架，显著提高了临床挑战性案例的学习效率，为资源受限环境下的放射学报告生成提供了可行方案

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce clinically
faithful reports from chest X-ray images. Prevailing work typically follows a
scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and
oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In
this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based
reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables
single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare
or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight
oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic
clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding
dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a
compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency
on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the
CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training
data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMSF是一个基于参考图像的无训练框架，能够在扩散模型中实现多风格的可控融合，解决了现有方法只能处理单一风格图像和缺乏平衡多种风格影响的机制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参考的方法存在两个主要限制：(a)只能接受一个风格图像，无法实现混合美学和扩展到更多风格；(b)缺乏平衡多种风格影响的机制。

Method: 通过语义标记分解模块编码所有风格图像和文本提示，自适应地注入到冻结扩散模型的每个交叉注意力层中，然后使用相似性感知重加权模块在每个去噪步骤重新校准对每个风格组件的注意力分配。

Result: 定性和定量评估显示，AMSF生成的多风格融合结果始终优于最先进的方法，且其融合设计可无缝扩展到两个或更多风格。

Conclusion: AMSF是朝着扩散模型中表达性多风格生成的实用步骤。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based
training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference
styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are
limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid
aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled
mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these
challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token
decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention
layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then
recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style
component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any
fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations
show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to
two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward
expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MLF-4DRCNet，一种用于4D雷达和相机图像多级融合的两阶段3D目标检测框架，通过点级、场景级和提案级融合解决雷达点云稀疏性问题，在VoD和TJ4DRadSet数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D毫米波雷达虽然成本效益高且鲁棒性强，但其点云存在显著稀疏性和噪声，限制了在3D目标检测中的独立应用。现有雷达-相机融合方法大多采用为LiDAR设计的BEV融合范式，忽视了雷达点云的稀疏性和不完整性，且仅进行粗粒度的场景级融合。

Method: 提出三阶段多级融合框架：1）ERPE模块通过2D图像实例增强雷达点云密度，使用三重注意力体素特征编码器编码；2）HSFP模块使用可变形注意力动态融合多尺度体素特征与2D图像特征；3）PLFE模块通过融合图像特征精炼区域提案。

Result: 在View-of-Delft和TJ4DRadSet数据集上的实验表明，MLF-4DRCNet达到了最先进的性能，特别是在VoD数据集上获得了与基于LiDAR模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的多级融合方法能够有效解决4D雷达点云稀疏性问题，实现全面的特征表示，为自动驾驶中的低成本感知提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar, measuring the range, azimuth,
elevation, and Doppler velocity of objects, is recognized for its
cost-effectiveness and robustness in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, its
point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone
application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have
provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt
explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera
fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the
sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to
coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose
MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via
multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the
point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling
comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components:
the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion
Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module.
Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image
instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel
Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D
image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts
pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image
features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP.
Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets
demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD
dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDLS是一种基于Rectified Flow模型的训练免费框架，通过双流潜在空间引导解决扩散模型图像反演中的语义漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像编码为单个潜在向量时，难以平衡结构保真度和语义准确性，导致重建图像出现语义漂移（如细节模糊或属性错误）。

Method: PDLS将反演过程分解为两个互补流：结构路径保持源图像完整性，语义路径由提示词引导。通过最优控制问题建模，使用线性二次调节器（LQR）获得闭式解，动态引导生成轨迹。

Result: 在FFHQ-1K和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，PDLS在各种反演任务（高斯去模糊、运动去模糊、超分辨率和自由形式修复）中，比单潜在基线产生更忠实于原始图像且与语义信息更好对齐的重建结果。

Conclusion: PDLS框架有效解决了扩散模型图像反演中的语义漂移问题，无需昂贵的逐图像优化，实现了结构保真度和语义准确性的更好平衡。

Abstract: Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is
challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent
vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading
to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect
attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering
(PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for
their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two
complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a
semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal
control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory
at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine
detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K
and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring,
motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that
PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image
and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球MRI需求持续增长给医疗系统带来压力，特别是在资源匮乏地区。需要AI技术来缓解医生负担、缩短诊断时间并减少医疗系统偏见。

Method: 利用大型学术医疗系统作为数据引擎，训练了包含22万例MRI研究的视觉语言模型Prima，采用分层视觉架构提供通用且可转移的MRI特征。

Result: 在包含3万例MRI研究的1年系统测试中，Prima在主要神经疾病（肿瘤、炎症、感染、发育病变等）诊断中平均AUC达92.0%，优于现有AI模型，并展示算法公平性。

Conclusion: Prima展示了健康系统规模视觉语言模型的变革潜力，能够推进AI驱动的医疗保健，特别是在缓解医疗系统偏见和改善资源匮乏人群服务方面。

Abstract: Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological
diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has
risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging
turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout \cite{Chen2017-bt,
Rula2024-qp-1}. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in
low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health
system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM)
serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical
MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a
hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI
features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included
30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic
disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental
lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0,
outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima
offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists,
and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and
MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups
and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times
for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven
healthcare.

Motivation: 现有基于Chain-of-Thought的推理方法将理解和生成过程分离，限制了其对统一模型生成能力缺陷的指导能力。

Method: UiG框架引入"图像编辑"作为桥梁，在推理过程中利用统一模型的强大理解能力来指导生成。首先验证生成图像并融入模型理解到编辑指令中，然后逐步增强生成图像。

Conclusion: UiG框架通过理解与生成的深度融合，有效缓解了统一模型生成能力的局限性，为文本到图像生成提供了新的推理范式。

Abstract: Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for
text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these
reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which
limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the
deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel
reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG),
which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to
reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is
to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities
during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative
abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse
understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated
image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing
instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step,
gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG

Abstract: Monocular relative and metric depth estimation has seen a tremendous boost in
the last few years due to the sharp advancements in foundation models and in
particular transformer based networks. As we start to see applications to the
domain of endoscopic images, there is still a lack of robust benchmarks and
high-quality datasets in that area. This paper addresses these limitations by
presenting a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art (metric and relative)
depth estimation models evaluated on real, unseen endoscopic images, providing
critical insights into their generalisation and performance in clinical
scenarios. Additionally, we introduce and publish a novel synthetic dataset
(EndoSynth) of endoscopic surgical instruments paired with ground truth metric
depth and segmentation masks, designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and
real-world data. We demonstrate that fine-tuning depth foundation models using
our synthetic dataset boosts accuracy on most unseen real data by a significant
margin. By providing both a benchmark and a synthetic dataset, this work
advances the field of depth estimation for endoscopic images and serves as an
important resource for future research. Project page, EndoSynth dataset and
trained weights are available at https://github.com/TouchSurgery/EndoSynth.

TL;DR: 本文提出LEAF-Mamba模型，通过局部强调状态空间模块和自适应融合模块，在RGB-D显著目标检测任务中实现了性能与计算效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D显著目标检测方法存在局部感受野限制或二次复杂度问题，难以平衡性能与计算效率。状态空间模型虽能建模长距离依赖，但直接应用于RGB-D SOD会导致局部语义不足和跨模态融合不充分。

Method: 提出LEAF-Mamba模型，包含局部强调状态空间模块（LE-SSM）捕获多尺度局部依赖，以及基于SSM的自适应融合模块（AFM）实现互补的跨模态交互和可靠集成。

Result: 在16个最先进RGB-D SOD方法中，LEAF-Mamba在效能和效率上均表现最优，同时在RGB-T SOD任务上也展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LEAF-Mamba模型成功解决了RGB-D SOD中的局部语义不足和跨模态融合问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了卓越性能。

Abstract: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous
objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods
mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision
Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a
challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently,
state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling
long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to
RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate
cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and
Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel
components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture
multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive
fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable
cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in
both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent
performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合窗口多头注意力机制和空间注意力机制的轻量级食品图像分类算法，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低了计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社会发展和科技进步，食品行业对生产质量和效率要求不断提高，但Vision Transformer模型参数多、计算复杂度高，限制了其在资源受限环境中的应用

Method: 集成窗口多头注意力机制(WMHAM)和空间注意力机制(SAM)，WMHAM通过窗口划分降低计算成本，SAM自适应强调关键空间区域以提升特征表示能力

Result: 在Food-101和Vireo Food-172数据集上分别达到95.24%和94.33%的准确率，同时显著减少了参数和FLOPs

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和分类性能之间取得了有效平衡，适合在资源受限环境中部署

Abstract: With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and
technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality
and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling
automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety
supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this
task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high
computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues,
we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a
Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism
(SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global
contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM
adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature
representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%,
respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with
baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an
effective balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

TL;DR: OSDA是一个用于遥感图像中无标注开放集土地覆盖发现、分割和描述的三阶段框架，结合了像素级精度和高级语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感中的开放集土地覆盖分析需要能够实现细粒度空间定位和语义开放分类，不仅需要检测和分割无类别监督的新对象，还需要通过多模态推理为其分配可解释的语义标签。

Method: 三阶段流程：(1)使用可提示的微调分割模型(SAM)进行精确发现和掩码提取；(2)通过两阶段微调的多模态大语言模型(MLLM)进行语义归因和上下文描述；(3)使用LLM作为评判者和人工评分对MLLM进行评估。

Result: 该框架支持在不同卫星图像上进行鲁棒评估，无需人工标注，为动态土地覆盖监测提供了可扩展和可解释的解决方案。

Conclusion: OSDA在自动制图更新和大规模地球观测分析方面显示出强大潜力，解决了开放世界遥感解释中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to
achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization.
This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without
categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels
through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated
three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery,
segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery
and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2)
semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned
multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring
of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level
semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote
sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free,
the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery
without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and
interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong
potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation
analysis.

TL;DR: LifeCLEF 2021植物识别挑战旨在评估如何利用植物标本馆收藏改进生物多样性丰富但数据贫乏地区（如热带国家）的植物自动识别。挑战基于南美洲圭亚那地盾约1000种植物，采用跨域分类方法，训练集包含数十万标本馆标本和数千张照片，测试集仅包含野外照片。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动植物识别主要基于北美和西欧的数据，而生物多样性最丰富的热带地区数据匮乏。植物标本馆收藏了几个世纪的植物标本，特别是热带地区标本，为改进这些地区的植物识别提供了机会。

Method: 采用跨域分类任务，训练集包含大量标本馆标本和少量照片，学习两个领域之间的对应关系。数据还包括每个物种的5个形态和功能性状值。测试集仅包含野外照片。

Result: 挑战评估了不同研究团队的方法和系统，分析了主要结果。具体结果未在摘要中详细说明。

Conclusion: 利用植物标本馆收藏可以改进数据贫乏热带地区的自动植物识别，LifeCLEF 2021挑战为此提供了评估框架和资源。

Abstract: Automated plant identification has improved considerably thanks to recent
advances in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and
more field photos. However, this profusion of data concerns only a few tens of
thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe, much
less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical
countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have
systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria,
especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity
informatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised
records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF
2021") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of
flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It
is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana
Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant
diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain
classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred
thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a
correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata
(location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values
of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species. The test set
consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This article presents the
resources and evaluations of the assessment carried out, summarises the
approaches and systems used by the participating research groups and provides
an analysis of the main results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AGSwap方法用于跨类别对象融合，并构建了COF数据集来解决现有方法在文本到图像生成中存在的偏差和语义不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨类别对象融合在虚拟现实、数字媒体等领域有广泛应用，但现有方法常产生有偏差、视觉混乱或语义不一致的结果，且缺乏全面的基准数据集。

Method: AGSwap方法包含两个关键组件：组级嵌入交换（通过特征操作融合不同概念的语义属性）和自适应组更新（基于平衡评估分数的动态优化机制）。

Result: 实验表明AGSwap在简单和复杂提示下均优于包括GPT-Image-1在内的最先进组合T2I方法。

Conclusion: AGSwap是一种简单而高效的跨类别对象融合方法，配合新构建的COF数据集，显著提升了文本到图像生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained
increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad
applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However,
existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically
inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration.
Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a
comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose
\textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective
approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping,
which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature
manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism
guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis.
Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a
large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and
WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling
451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap
outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1
using simple and complex prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有遥感视觉定位方法受限于闭集词汇表，以及依赖高质量数据集和耗时微调的问题

Method: 三阶段框架：1）利用视觉语言模型获取跨注意力图；2）利用扩散模型补充结构信息；3）注意力进化模块净化分割掩码

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架持续优于现有的弱监督和零样本方法

Conclusion: RSVG-ZeroOV提供了一个高效且可扩展的解决方案，无需繁琐的任务特定训练

Abstract: Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote
sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing
approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their
applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage
generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on
expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework
that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for
zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key
stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain
cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use
self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as
cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that
capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii)
Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model
(DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are
often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention
evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding
purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome
task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently
outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

### [61] [What Makes You Unique? Attribute Prompt Composition for Object Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18715)
*Yingquan Wang,Pingping Zhang,Chong Sun,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种属性提示组合（APC）框架，通过文本语义增强行人重识别（ReID）的判别性和泛化性，解决了单域模型过拟合和跨域模型抑制身份判别特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ReID模型大多局限于单域或跨域场景，单域模型容易过拟合到特定域特征，而跨域模型通过归一化策略可能无意中抑制身份特异性判别线索。需要一种既能增强判别性又能提高泛化能力的方法。

Method: 设计了属性提示生成器（APG），包含语义属性字典（SAD）和提示组合模块（PCM）。SAD提供丰富的语义描述，PCM自适应组合相关属性生成判别性特征。同时提出快慢训练策略（FSTS），通过快速更新流获取ReID特定知识，慢速更新流保留预训练视觉语言模型的泛化知识。

Result: 在传统和域泛化（DG）ReID数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架在判别性和泛化性方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: APC框架通过利用文本语义和快慢训练策略，有效平衡了ReID特定判别性和泛化表示学习，在多个数据集上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across
non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable
progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or
cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain
models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models
often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress
identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose
an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual
semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically,
we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic
Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an
over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while
PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative
attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization
ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training
Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable
representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS)
to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update
Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the
pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively
focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive
experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets
demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting
superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization. The
source code is available at https://github.com/AWangYQ/APC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法仅依赖图像和文本的全局表示来匹配新的标题，忽略了细粒度特征，可能引入错误的图像-文本对并损害CLIP预训练。

Method: 提出OTCCLIP框架，使用最优传输距离度量细粒度视觉和文本特征集之间的距离，并基于该距离重新分配标题。同时采用最优传输目标函数促进跨模态和模态内的细粒度对齐。

Result: 实验表明OTCCLIP能成功降低投毒攻击的成功率，并在中毒数据集上显著提升CLIP的零样本和线性探测性能。

Conclusion: OTCCLIP通过细粒度特征的最优传输对齐，有效防御了CLIP模型的投毒攻击，同时保持了模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to
massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous
defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption
for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global
representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of
visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and
harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal
Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We
propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained
visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the
proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the
negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality
fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective
functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease
the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous
methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing
performance trained on poisoned datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型主要采用结果导向范式，忽略了底层交互过程，这种表示差异阻碍了有效的知识迁移并限制了跨视觉任务的泛化能力

Method: 基于两个技术创新：1）交互查询，在网络层间保持持久关系结构；2）基于交互的监督，源自视觉语言模型的跨模态注意力机制

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现一致改进：TinyImageNet分类提升3.3mAP，COCO检测/分割提升1.6mAP/2.4AP，跨域设置下PACS和VLCS分别提升2.4和9.3零样本性能

Conclusion: LFI框架在认知对齐方面表现优异，在语义一致性指标上比结果导向方法高出2.7倍，具有最小参数开销和更快收敛速度

Abstract: Current visual foundation models (VFMs) face a fundamental limitation in
transferring knowledge from vision language models (VLMs), while VLMs excel at
modeling cross-modal interactions through unified representation spaces,
existing VFMs predominantly adopt result-oriented paradigms that neglect the
underlying interaction processes. This representational discrepancy hinders
effective knowledge transfer and limits generalization across diverse vision
tasks. We propose Learning from Interactions (LFI), a cognitive-inspired
framework that addresses this gap by explicitly modeling visual understanding
as an interactive process. Our key insight is that capturing the dynamic
interaction patterns encoded in pre-trained VLMs enables more faithful and
efficient knowledge transfer to VFMs. The approach centers on two technical
innovations, Interaction Queries, which maintain persistent relational
structures across network layers, and interaction-based supervision, derived
from the cross-modal attention mechanisms of VLMs. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving 3.3
and 1.6mAP/2.4AP absolute gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO
detection/segmentation respectively, with minimal parameter overhead and faster
convergence. The framework particularly excels in cross-domain settings,
delivering 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Human
evaluations further confirm its cognitive alignment, outperforming
result-oriented methods by 2.7 times in semantic consistency metrics.

Conclusion: HyPSAM展示了提示工程在RGB-T SOD领域的潜力，为多模态显著目标检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent
objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal
modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects
remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the
extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the
zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for
RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that
generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs
dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive
cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter
kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose
a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general
optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid
prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and
box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating
with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains,
thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The

<details>

Motivation: LiDAR点云易受噪声、遮挡和对抗性破坏影响，传统自编码器在真实场景下性能下降，需要更鲁棒的解决方案

Method: 通过多模态交叉注意力机制对齐文本语义线索、图像几何特征和LiDAR空间结构，学习抗噪声和对抗攻击的表示

Result: 在强对抗攻击和重噪声条件下显著优于CNN自编码器，在nuScenes-mini数据集上验证了有效性

Conclusion: 多模态融合框架具有模型无关性，可与任何CNN点云自编码器集成，为自动驾驶感知提供鲁棒解决方案

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception is central to autonomous driving and robotics, yet raw
point clouds remain highly vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial
corruptions. Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and
reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world
conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention
autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from
multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning
semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial
structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to
stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing
limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more
robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where
CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to
reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion
framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出COLT方法，增强开源视频大语言模型的持续工具使用能力，解决现有方法在工具数据持续演化环境中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM工具使用方法假设工具库固定，难以适应现实世界中工具数据持续演化和流式输入的环境。

Method: COLT方法包含可学习的工具代码本作为工具特定记忆系统，基于用户指令与工具特征的相似度动态选择相关工具，避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在视频LLM基准测试和工具使用专用数据集VideoToolBench上的实验表明，COLT达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: COLT成功增强了开源视频LLMs的持续工具使用能力，在动态工具环境中表现出色。

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the
research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert
models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage
capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the
instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however,
assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to
real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming
in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL
Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a
successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past
learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as
a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected
based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the
codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a
video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive
experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific
VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
proposed COLT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixingGS是一种无需训练的方法，利用现有扩散模型增强稀疏视角3D高斯溅射重建，通过改进的蒸馏方法和自适应渐进增强方案解决多视角一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视角下的3D重建由于视觉信息不足会产生明显伪影，现有基于生成先验的方法难以保证多视角一致性，导致结构模糊和细节不合理。

Method: 提出训练免费的FixingGS方法，核心是提供更准确和跨视角一致的扩散先验的蒸馏方法，以及自适应渐进增强方案来细化欠约束区域的重建。

Result: 大量实验表明FixingGS在视觉质量和重建性能上超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FixingGS通过有效利用扩散模型能力，成功解决了稀疏视角3D高斯溅射重建中的伪影去除和补全问题，同时保证了多视角一致性。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes
from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual
information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D
representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to
generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in
under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle
to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and
implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method
that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for
sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our
distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent
diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting.
In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further
refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with
superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be
released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-VLM提出了一种基于高斯分位数的非均匀权重分离方法，通过将模型权重分为异常值（显著）和多个内围值（不显著）子集，实现超低比特（≤2位）的视觉语言模型量化，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的高计算成本和内存需求限制了其在硬件受限环境中的应用，需要解决计算需求与超低比特权重精度之间的关键差距。

Method: 提出基于高斯分位数的非均匀权重分离方法，将权重分为异常值和内围值子集；开发显著性感知混合量化算法，根据显著性度量和压缩目标对缩放器和二进制矩阵施加不同约束。

Result: 在语言模型部分，Bi-VLM在视觉问答任务上比SOTA方法提升3%-47%；整体VLM性能提升4%-45%。量化模型存在90%-99%的图像令牌冗余，可进一步剪枝提升效率。

Conclusion: Bi-VLM成功实现了超低比特视觉语言模型量化，显著提升了模型效率，同时保持了良好的性能，为硬件受限环境下的VLM应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We address the critical gap between the computational demands of
vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision
(bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated
by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which
restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose
Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian
quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and
multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a
proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We
propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize
weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices
based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our
approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM
outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms
of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM,
our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the
quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99%
in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to
improve efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiSSECT是一个自监督学习框架，通过多尺度向量量化在医学图像表示学习中引入离散表示瓶颈，抑制捷径学习，提高特征的可迁移性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法依赖复杂架构、解剖学先验或精心调优的数据增强，限制了可扩展性和泛化性，且容易在医学图像中发生捷径学习。

Method: 将多尺度向量量化集成到自监督学习流程中，通过离散表示瓶颈约束模型学习可重复、结构感知的特征，抑制视图特定或低效用模式。

Result: DiSSECT在分类和分割任务上表现优异，需要极少或无需微调，在低标签场景下具有高标签效率，在多个公共医学影像数据集上验证了其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: DiSSECT框架通过离散表示瓶颈有效解决了医学图像自监督学习中的捷径学习问题，提高了表示的可迁移性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for medical
image representation learning, particularly in settings with limited labeled
data. However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures,
anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their
scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to
shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical
similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT
-- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable
Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization
into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This
constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while
suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation
transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both
classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and
shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate
DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its
robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合热成像、深度学习和车联网通信的实时检测与驾驶员预警系统，旨在减少鹿车碰撞事故。该系统在12000张热成像鹿图像数据集上训练，表现出98.84%的平均精度，并在实地测试中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国每年发生约210万起鹿车碰撞事故，造成440人死亡、59000人受伤和100亿美元经济损失，同时导致鹿群数量下降。现有可见光摄像头在恶劣天气条件下检测效果不佳（低于60%），需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 系统整合热成像技术、深度学习算法和C-V2X通信技术。使用在北卡罗来纳州Mars Hill收集的12000张热成像鹿图像数据集进行训练和验证，当检测到高概率目标时通过C-V2X设备向周围车辆和路边单元广播预警信息。

Result: 系统性能优异：平均精度98.84%，精确率95.44%，召回率95.96%。热成像在恶劣天气条件下保持88-92%的检测准确率，而传统可见光摄像头仅60%。端到端延迟始终低于100毫秒。实地测试验证了系统在不同天气条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过热成像和车联网技术建立了一条可行的技术路径来减少鹿车碰撞事故，系统具有高精度、低延迟和恶劣天气适应性等优势。

Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United
States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in
approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic
damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer
populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning
system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and
vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions.
Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal
deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation
demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision,
95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested
during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the
driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across
diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92
percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible
light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high
probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to
surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything
(CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency
consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This
research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle
collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

TL;DR: SAADi框架通过将扩散模型与下游模型偏好的样本对齐，解决手术数据稀缺问题，避免数据记忆化导致的样本不一致性，显著提升分类和分割任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术数据标注稀缺限制了深度学习系统在计算机辅助干预中的发展，现有扩散模型存在数据记忆化问题，导致生成的样本不一致且缺乏多样性，可能损害下游任务性能。

Method: 提出Surgical Application-Aligned Diffusion (SAADi)框架，构建偏好和非偏好合成图像对，通过轻量级微调使扩散模型的图像生成过程与下游目标明确对齐。

Result: 在三个手术数据集上的实验显示，分类任务提升7-9%，分割任务提升2-10%，对代表性不足的类别改进尤为显著。迭代细化合成样本可进一步提升性能4-10%。

Conclusion: SAADi方法克服了样本退化问题，确立了任务感知对齐作为缓解数据稀缺和推进手术视觉应用的关键原则。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for
developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While
diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data
memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to
improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical
Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion
models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs
of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs
lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation
process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical
datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and
$2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed
for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further
boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method
overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key
principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision
applications.

Motivation: 动态PET中时间帧图像质量受限于统计量不足，特别是在短时间帧中。深度学习在医学图像去噪任务中显示出广泛应用潜力。

Method: 利用动态PET的帧间空间相关性和帧内结构一致性建立核空间多维稀疏模型，用神经网络替代参数估计的内在形式，形成端到端的KMDS-Net。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上的广泛实验表明，KMDS-Net在动态PET去噪方面表现出强大的性能，优于之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效实现动态PET的高时间和空间分辨率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Achieving high image quality for temporal frames in dynamic positron emission
tomography (PET) is challenging due to the limited statistic especially for the
short frames. Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) is useful in a
wide range of medical image denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a
model-based neural network for dynamic PET image denoising. The inter-frame
spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are
used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model.
We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural
networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end
neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data
demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for
dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may
be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic
PET. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合光流分割标签插值和多任务学习的新框架，用于解决机器人辅助手术中视觉数据理解的问题，特别是针对时空标注不平衡的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人辅助手术需要精确理解手术过程中的视觉数据，但现有方法多为单任务学习，难以处理复杂的手术场景动态和器械交互。同时，像素级分割数据标注成本高，导致长期标注（如阶段和步骤）和短期标注（如器械分割和动作检测）之间存在时空不平衡。

Method: 使用基于光流的分割标签插值方法，通过从标注关键帧估计光流，将标签传播到相邻未标注帧，从而丰富稀疏的空间监督信息，平衡时空信息用于多任务学习训练。

Result: 该框架提高了手术场景理解的准确性和效率，进而增强了机器人辅助手术的实用性。

Conclusion: 通过结合光流标签插值和多任务学习，有效解决了手术场景理解中的时空标注不平衡问题，为机器人辅助手术的视觉数据分析提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern
surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through
minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a
precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures
is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task
approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and
diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding.
Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires
sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to
the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term
annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas
short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action
detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant
temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation
with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is
used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse
spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for
training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of
surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了成本效益和响应性的最佳平衡，使复杂的多模态交互变得无缝和即时

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for
their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse
content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved
multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and
autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address
this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to
simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our
approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for
next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion
denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over
a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting
lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a
22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of
the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that
enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining
advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model
achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex
multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

Result: Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-4o超越了ResNet50基线模型，但在Wikidata数据集上准确率显著下降。添加类别描述通常能提高零样本性能，而少样本学习效果较差。

Conclusion: 通用多模态大语言模型能够在视觉复杂的文化遗产领域进行分类，支持其在数字人文学科工作流中作为元数据管理工具的应用。

Abstract: This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the task of single-label
classification of Christian Iconography. The goal was to assess whether
general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5,
can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers,
and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis:
(RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian
saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with
contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study
using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and
Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were
tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2)
classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five
exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the
same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed
the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset,
where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity
to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions
generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced
lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We
conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in
visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the
application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows,
suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the
study to other classification strategies and models.

Conclusion: LRGC提供了一种可学习的、无需超参数的图构建方法，能够更好地捕捉节点间关系，提升视觉图神经网络的性能。

Abstract: Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision.
Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural
Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers.
Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of
images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image
representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer
that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a
hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on
non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the
latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best
neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph
Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack
the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction
method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized
Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies
key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold
reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable
mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the
neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding
methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows
tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds
are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the
model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark
dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出结构化反思方法，将错误到修复的路径转化为明确、可控且可训练的动作，通过优化反思-调用-最终的三步策略，显著提升多轮工具调用的成功率和错误恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具增强的大型语言模型通常使用监督模仿或粗粒度强化学习进行训练，自我反思实践依赖启发式提示或单向推理，在多轮交互中脆弱，模型经常重复相同错误。

Method: 提出结构化反思方法，结合DAPO和GSPO目标与针对工具使用的奖励方案，优化反思-调用-最终的三步策略。引入Tool-Reflection-Bench基准程序化检查结构有效性、可执行性、参数正确性和结果一致性。

Result: 在BFCL v3和Tool-Reflection-Bench上的实验显示，多轮工具调用成功率和错误恢复能力大幅提升，冗余调用减少。

Conclusion: 使反思明确化并直接优化可以改善工具交互的可靠性，为智能体从失败中学习提供可复现的路径。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with
supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes
single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts
or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning
error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a
failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured
reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,
controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise
reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and
then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine
DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing
the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce
Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks
structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result
consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,
reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.
Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn
tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These
results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly
improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for
agents to learn from failure.

Conclusion: 建立了一个灵活、可解释、即插即用的提示优化框架

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), yet existing approaches often rely on heuristic or
manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization. In this
paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning
framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize
point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by
representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode
both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker
agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's
segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these
disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep
Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During
inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt
sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks

TL;DR: 提出首个无需Structure-from-Motion的基于事件相机的去模糊3D高斯泼溅方法DeblurSplat，通过利用预训练的稠密立体模块直接获取初始点云，并引入事件流提供细粒度监督信号，实现高效高质量的去模糊3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中由于不准确的相机位姿导致的累积误差问题，以及利用事件相机对动态变化的高敏感性来提升去模糊效果。

Method: 1) 使用DUSt3R稠密立体模块直接从模糊图像获取准确初始点云，避免相机位姿计算；2) 引入事件流，通过解码潜在清晰图像为场景重建优化提供细粒度监督信号。

Result: 在多种场景下的实验表明，DeblurSplat不仅能生成高保真度的新视角图像，而且在渲染效率上显著优于当前最先进的去模糊3D-GS方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需SfM的高效去模糊3D重建，结合事件相机的优势，为动态场景的3D重建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-free
deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting method via event camera, dubbed DeblurSplat.
We address the motion-deblurring problem in two ways. First, we leverage the
pretrained capability of the dense stereo module (DUSt3R) to directly obtain
accurate initial point clouds from blurred images. Without calculating camera
poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from
inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we
introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to
dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and
blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene
reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes
demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel
views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs
in deblur 3D-GS.

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns arise from spectral aliasing between display pixel lattices
and camera sensor grids, manifesting as anisotropic, multi-scale artifacts that
pose significant challenges for digital image demoir\'eing. We propose
Moir\'eNet, a convolutional neural U-Net-based framework that synergistically
integrates frequency and spatial domain features for effective artifact
removal. Moir\'eNet introduces two key components: a Directional
Frequency-Spatial Encoder (DFSE) that discerns moir\'e orientation via
directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector
(FSAS) that enables precise, feature-adaptive suppression. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Moir\'eNet achieves state-of-the-art performance
on public and actively used datasets while being highly parameter-efficient.
With only 5.513M parameters, representing a 48% reduction compared to ESDNet-L,
Moir\'eNet combines superior restoration quality with parameter efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained applications including
smartphone photography, industrial imaging, and augmented reality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的频率感知音频-视觉分割（FAVS）框架，通过频率域分解和重组来解决音频和视觉模态在频率域上的矛盾，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的音频-视觉分割方法忽视了音频和视觉模态在频率域上的固有矛盾——音频高频信号普遍存在干扰噪声，而视觉高频信号包含丰富的结构细节。忽略这些差异会导致次优性能。

Method: FAVS框架包含两个关键模块：频率域增强分解器（FDED）模块采用基于残差的迭代频率分解来区分模态特定的语义和结构特征；协同跨模态一致性（SCMC）模块利用专家混合架构通过动态专家路由来增强语义一致性和模态特定特征保留。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，FAVS框架实现了最先进的性能，丰富的定性可视化进一步验证了所提出模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将AVS任务重新表述为频率域分解和重组问题，FAVS框架有效解决了音频-视觉模态的频率域矛盾，为多模态机器学习提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) plays a critical role in multimodal machine
learning by effectively integrating audio and visual cues to precisely segment
objects or regions within visual scenes. Recent AVS methods have demonstrated
significant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain
contradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering
noise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in
visual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper
perspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and
recomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware
Audio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules:
Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal
Consistency (SCMC) module. FDED module employs a residual-based iterative
frequency decomposition to discriminate modality-specific semantics and
structural features, and SCMC module leverages a mixture-of-experts
architecture to reinforce semantic consistency and modality-specific feature
preservation through dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our FAVS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
benchmark datasets, and abundant qualitative visualizations further verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FDED and SCMC modules. The code will be released
as open source upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: 提出的改进DDPM方法能有效生成高质量合成LiDAR数据，显著提升自动驾驶感知系统的性能，为解决真实数据采集的局限性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by
improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that
effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs
use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides
high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation,
and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is
time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather
or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding
techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby
improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in
AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's
temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on
the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various
configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance
metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results
demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and
its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data,
producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural
detail.

TL;DR: AGSSP是一种新的预训练范式，通过异常先验指导表示学习，解决了金属表面缺陷检测中预训练-微调范式的领域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法面临两个关键问题：在自然图像数据集（如ImageNet）上预训练存在显著的领域差距，而在工业数据上进行自监督预训练又因现有学习目标无法区分细微缺陷模式与复杂背景噪声而效果不佳。

Method: AGSSP采用两阶段框架：首先通过从异常图中蒸馏知识来预训练模型骨干网络，鼓励网络捕获缺陷显著特征；然后使用从这些图导出的伪缺陷框来预训练检测器，使其与定位任务对齐。开发了知识增强方法生成高质量异常图，并收集了12万张图像的大规模工业数据集。

Conclusion: AGSSP通过异常先验指导的表示学习，有效解决了金属表面缺陷检测中的预训练困境，显著提升了检测性能，所有代码、预训练模型和数据集均已公开。

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface
defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However,
its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image
datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive
self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective
due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle
defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we
introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm
that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP
employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by
distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture
defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect
boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable
this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly
maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images.
Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface
defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP
consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a
10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to
ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly
available at https://clovermini.github.io/AGSSP-Dev/.

Motivation: 现有方法主要将音频特征映射到几何变形，忽略了音频相关的外观变化。本文旨在开发一个能够同时捕捉几何和外观变化的通用音频驱动头像模型。

Method: 使用跨身份多视角视频训练UHAP，通过中性扫描数据进行监督学习。构建通用语音模型将原始音频直接映射到UHAP潜在表达空间，该空间编码几何和外观变化。采用单目编码器进行个性化微调。

Result: 方法能够生成高度逼真的头像，具有精确的唇部同步和细腻的表情细节（如眉毛运动、视线转移、口腔内部外观和运动）。在唇部同步准确性、图像质量和感知真实感方面优于现有几何方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个能够进行详细外观建模和渲染的通用音频驱动头像模型，在多个评估指标上均优于竞争方法，实现了逼真的头像合成效果。

Abstract: We introduce the first method for audio-driven universal photorealistic
avatar synthesis, combining a person-agnostic speech model with our novel
Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP). UHAP is trained on cross-identity
multi-view videos. In particular, our UHAP is supervised with neutral scan
data, enabling it to capture the identity-specific details at high fidelity. In
contrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to
geometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance
variations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the
UHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both,
geometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new
subjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression
of dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these
expression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage
to focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry.
Decoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly
realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive
details, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior
appearance as well as motion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
is not only the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that can account
for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, but it also outperforms
competing (geometry-only) methods across metrics measuring lip-sync accuracy,
quantitative image quality, and perceptual realism.

Abstract: Dendritic spines are key structural components of excitatory synapses in the
brain. Given the size of dendritic spines provides a proxy for synaptic
efficacy, their detection and tracking across time is important for studies of
the neural basis of learning and memory. Despite their relevance, large-scale
analyses of the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy
data remain challenging and labor-intense. Here, we present a modular machine
learning-based pipeline designed to automate the detection, time-tracking, and
feature extraction of dendritic spines in volumes chronically recorded with
two-photon microscopy. Our approach tackles the challenges posed by biological
data by combining a transformer-based detection module, a depth-tracking
component that integrates spatial features, a time-tracking module to associate
3D spines across time by leveraging spatial consistency, and a feature
extraction unit that quantifies biologically relevant spine properties. We
validate our method on open-source labeled spine data, and on two complementary
annotated datasets that we publish alongside this work: one for detection and
depth-tracking, and one for time-tracking, which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first data of this kind. To encourage future research, we release our
data, code, and pre-trained weights at
https://github.com/pamelaosuna/SynapFlow, establishing a baseline for scalable,
end-to-end analysis of dendritic spine dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法无需VLM微调或大型语言模型，仅依赖视觉模型减少对语义表示的依赖，为标注数据稀缺场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification
performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a
major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce.
Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual
models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper
proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM
and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the
set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a
confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier
directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies
high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual
representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier,
allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without
supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large
language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on
semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

Motivation: 现有方法如NeRF和3DGS在含镜面场景中性能下降，主要关注镜面表面的对称映射，但忽略了镜面反射携带的丰富信息，这些反射可以提供补充视角来填补缺失细节。

Method: 提出了ReflectiveGS方法，基于3D高斯泼溅技术，将镜面反射作为补充视角而非简单的对称伪影，从而增强场景几何并恢复缺失细节。

Conclusion: ReflectiveGS为含镜面环境中的3D重建设定了新的基准，展示了利用镜面反射信息的有效性。

Abstract: Mirror-containing environments pose unique challenges for 3D reconstruction
and novel view synthesis (NVS), as reflective surfaces introduce view-dependent
distortions and inconsistencies. While cutting-edge methods such as Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical
scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing
solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but
often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These
reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details
and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction
in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset
featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror
masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in
reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of
3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary
viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and
recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that
ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and
training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich
environments.

Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in
gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard
for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the
advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the
laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a
significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury,
it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct.
This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach
for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired
during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of
an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed.
Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the
training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical
considerations.

Conclusion: Prompt-DAS框架在领域自适应分割任务中表现出色，具有灵活性和高效性。

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) of numerous organelle instances from
large-scale electron microscopy (EM) is a promising way to enable
annotation-efficient learning. Inspired by SAM, we propose a promptable
multitask framework, namely Prompt-DAS, which is flexible enough to utilize any
number of point prompts during the adaptation training stage and testing stage.
Thus, with varying prompt configurations, Prompt-DAS can perform unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) and weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA), as well
as interactive segmentation during testing. Unlike the foundation model SAM,
which necessitates a prompt for each individual object instance, Prompt-DAS is
only trained on a small dataset and can utilize full points on all instances,
sparse points on partial instances, or even no points at all, facilitated by
the incorporation of an auxiliary center-point detection task. Moreover, a
novel prompt-guided contrastive learning is proposed to enhance discriminative
feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing UDA, WDA,
and SAM-based approaches.

TL;DR: 提出VIR-Bench基准测试，包含200个旅行视频，用于评估多模态大语言模型在长距离地理时空轨迹理解方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基准主要关注室内场景或短距离户外活动，缺乏对长距离旅行挑战的探索，而掌握扩展的地理时空轨迹对于下一代MLLMs在现实世界任务中至关重要。

Method: 构建包含200个旅行视频的VIR-Bench基准，将行程重建作为评估任务，并开发原型旅行规划代理来验证基准的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，包括专有模型在内的最先进MLLMs在VIR-Bench上表现不佳，突显了处理跨越扩展时空尺度视频的难度。

Conclusion: VIR-Bench不仅能有效评估模型性能，其评估协议还能转化为面向用户应用的具体性能提升，验证了基准的实用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new
possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus
largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the
challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering
extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation
MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and
navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark
consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a
challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs'
geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high
scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended
spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in
which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights
gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations
verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but
also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言推理方法通常在粗粒度层面使用推理链，难以进行细粒度结构化推理，并且难以评估中间推理的质量和奖励。

Result: 在具有挑战性的视觉语言基准测试中取得了显著的改进，建立了强基线。

Conclusion: 该工作为视觉语言模型提供了基准，并为更复杂的多模态推理提供了见解。

Abstract: Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an
open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ
reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform
fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to
evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we
delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling
assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective
reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We
present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the
step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement
learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong
baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language
benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and
ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing
properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a
baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex
multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available at

*Ioannis Sarafis,Alexandros Papadopoulos,Anastasios Delopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SAM和ViT的弱监督食物图像语义分割方法，仅需图像级标注即可生成像素级分割掩码


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用SAM的零样本能力和ViT的注意力机制，避免对食物图像进行费时费力的像素级标注

Method: 使用Swin Transformer生成类激活图作为SAM的提示，结合图像预处理技术和单掩码/多掩码生成策略

Result: 在FoodSeg103数据集上达到mIoU 0.54，平均每张图像生成2.4个掩码（不包括背景）

Conclusion: 该方法可作为加速食物图像标注的工具，或集成到食物营养追踪应用中

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach
for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and
promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention
mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation
maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable
for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained
exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level
annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the
SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in
combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The
methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of
2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for
the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to
accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food
and nutrition tracking applications.

*Jierui Qu,Jianchun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyL-UNet是一种基于动态学习的时序一致性U-Net分割架构，旨在实现超声心动图分割的时间稳定性和精确性，通过构建回声动态图和心脏相位动态注意力机制来解决帧间分割抖动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图容易变形和产生斑点噪声，导致帧间分割抖动。即使单帧分割精度高，时间不稳定性也会削弱功能估计并影响临床可解释性。

Method: 提出DyL-UNet框架，通过动态学习构建回声动态图(EDG)提取视频动态信息，采用多个基于Swin-Transformer的编码器-解码器分支处理单帧图像，并在跳跃连接处引入心脏相位动态注意力(CPDA)机制。

Result: 在CAMUS和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上的广泛实验表明，DyL-UNet在保持与现有方法相当的分割精度的同时，实现了更优的时间一致性。

Conclusion: DyL-UNet为自动化临床超声心动图提供了可靠的解决方案，能够实现时间稳定且精确的分割。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. Yet echocardiography is prone to
deformation and speckle noise, causing frame-to-frame segmentation jitter. Even
with high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can
weaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address
these issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal
consistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally
stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an
Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic
information from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based
encoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further
introduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections,
which uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce
temporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS
and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation
accuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal
consistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical
echocardiography.

Motivation: 评估VLMs在复杂视觉环境中的鲁棒性，特别是在受色盲测试启发的对抗性场景中，以解决模型在复杂视觉模式中识别数字信息的能力不足问题。

Method: 创建包含500张类似石原色盲测试图像的数据集，包含0-99的数字和不同颜色组合，使用是/否和开放式提示评估9个VLMs，并与人类参与者进行比较。

Result: 实验显示模型在对抗性环境中解释数字的能力存在局限性，存在普遍的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: ColorBlindnessEval可作为评估和改进VLMs在现实应用中可靠性的有价值工具，强调了提高VLMs在复杂视觉环境中鲁棒性的必要性。

Abstract: This paper presents ColorBlindnessEval, a novel benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in visually
adversarial scenarios inspired by the Ishihara color blindness test. Our
dataset comprises 500 Ishihara-like images featuring numbers from 0 to 99 with
varying color combinations, challenging VLMs to accurately recognize numerical
information embedded in complex visual patterns. We assess 9 VLMs using Yes/No
and open-ended prompts and compare their performance with human participants.
Our experiments reveal limitations in the models' ability to interpret numbers
in adversarial contexts, highlighting prevalent hallucination issues. These
findings underscore the need to improve the robustness of VLMs in complex
visual environments. ColorBlindnessEval serves as a valuable tool for
benchmarking and improving the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications
where accuracy is critical.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveletGaussian是一个高效稀疏视图3D高斯重建框架，通过将扩散过程转移到小波域，仅在低分辨率子带应用扩散，高频子带使用轻量网络优化，显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在稀疏视图下的性能急剧下降，现有方法使用扩散模型修复渲染结果但计算成本高昂。

Method: 将扩散过程转移到小波域，仅在LL子带应用扩散，高频子带使用轻量网络优化；提出在线随机掩码策略替代低效的留一法。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和OmniObject3D数据集上的实验表明，WaveletGaussian在保持竞争性渲染质量的同时大幅减少训练时间。

Conclusion: WaveletGaussian为稀疏视图3D高斯重建提供了一种高效解决方案，通过小波域扩散和轻量网络优化实现了计算效率的提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for
image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in
sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing
diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo
ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur
heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present
WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object
reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain:
diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while
high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further
propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs
for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient,
leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360
and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality
while substantially reducing training time.

TL;DR: Sa2VA-i是对Sa2VA模型的改进版本，通过修正训练和推理过程中的不一致性问题，在多个视频分割基准上取得了新的最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现Sa2VA模型在视频对象分割任务中未能充分发挥潜力，主要原因是训练和推理过程存在不一致性。

Method: 提出Sa2VA-i模型，通过修正训练和推理过程中的不一致性问题来改进原Sa2VA模型。

Result: Sa2VA-i在多个视频基准上创造了新的最佳性能：MeViS提升+11.6 J&F，Ref-YT-VOS提升+1.4，Ref-DAVIS提升+3.3，ReVOS提升+4.1。Sa2VA-i-1B模型在MeViS基准上甚至能与原Sa2VA-26B模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了看似微不足道的实现细节的重要性，为视频分割领域提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Sa2VA is a recent model for language-guided dense grounding in images and
video that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple segmentation
benchmarks and that has become widely popular. However, we found that Sa2VA
does not perform according to its full potential for referring video object
segmentation tasks. We identify inconsistencies between training and inference
procedures as the key factor holding it back. To mitigate this issue, we
propose an improved version of Sa2VA, Sa2VA-i, that rectifies these issues and
improves the results. In fact, Sa2VA-i sets a new state of the art for multiple
video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on
Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA
checkpoints. With our fixes, the Sa2VA-i-1B model even performs on par with the
original Sa2VA-26B model on the MeViS benchmark. We hope that this work will
show the importance of seemingly trivial implementation details and that it
will provide valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱图像在遥感应用中很重要，但现有机器学习模型需要专门训练且成本高，而强大的通用多模态模型无法理解专业的多光谱信号。

Method: 采用训练免费的方法，将多光谱数据以零样本模式输入到仅基于RGB训练的多模态模型中，通过适应输入空间并注入领域特定指令来利用模型能力。

Result: 在Gemini2.5模型上验证，在土地覆盖和土地利用分类的流行遥感基准测试中观察到显著的零样本性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了地理空间专业人员可以轻松利用强大多模态模型处理非标准专业输入数据的潜力，加速工作流程并受益于丰富的推理能力。

Abstract: Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing
applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and
urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional
spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such
as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,
and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,
only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is
predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for
multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,
although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs
cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are
capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand
specialized multi-spectral signals.
  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new
multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist
multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the
multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to
inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions
into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe
strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing
benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy
adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential
for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to
easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate
their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities,
grounded in the specialized sensor data.

Conclusion: Citrus-V提供了从视觉定位到临床推理的统一流程，为临床诊断、治疗规划和手术决策提供重要支持。

Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment
planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly
focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their
generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit
strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications
demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought
reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that
combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection,
segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level
lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like
diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal
training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering
reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks.
Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical
models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering
a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting
precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second

Motivation: 交通事故检测对安全至关重要，但缺乏多样化的标注数据。研究旨在探索MLLMs在无需大量标注数据的情况下进行交通事故检测的潜力。

Method: 使用CARLA模拟的DeepAccident数据集，比较Gemini 1.5/2.0、Gemma 3和Pixtral模型的零样本性能，并集成YOLO、Deep SORT和SAM进行视觉分析增强提示。

Result: Pixtral表现最佳（F1-score 0.71，召回率83%），Gemini模型通过增强提示精度提升至90%但F1和召回率下降，Gemma 3性能最平衡。

Conclusion: MLLMs与先进视觉分析技术结合在自动化交通监控系统中具有巨大应用潜力。

Abstract: Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate
accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response.
Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for
continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci-
dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and
describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus
minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include:
(1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA,
explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based
accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance
analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent
identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3)
Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object
detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for
instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and
explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an
F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with
enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and
recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal
metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of
integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their
applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期点跟踪问题，需要在视频帧间保持点的一致性识别，应对显著的外观变化、运动和遮挡，特别针对在线实时和流式应用场景。

Method: 扩展Track-On模型为Track-On2，采用因果处理框架，通过内存机制保持时间一致性，在推理时进行粗粒度补丁级分类后细化，并系统研究合成训练对内存行为的影响。

Result: 在五个合成和真实世界基准测试中取得最先进结果，超越先前的在线跟踪器甚至利用双向上下文的强离线方法。

Conclusion: 基于因果、内存架构并纯合成数据训练的方法为真实世界点跟踪提供了可扩展的有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which
requires consistent identification of points across video frames under
significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online
setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time
and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2,
a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking.
Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural
refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training
strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or
iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal
coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions
without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level
classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically
study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing
how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive
experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong
offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the
effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic
data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking. Project page:

Abstract: We introduce KAMERA: a comprehensive system for multi-camera, multi-spectral
synchronization and real-time detection of seals and polar bears. Utilized in
aerial surveys for ice-associated seals in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort
seas around Alaska, KAMERA provides up to an 80% reduction in dataset
processing time over previous methods. Our rigorous calibration and hardware
synchronization enable using multiple spectra for object detection. All
collected data are annotated with metadata so they can be easily referenced
later. All imagery and animal detections from a survey are mapped onto a world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN在边缘设备上推理时面临的高延迟、高能耗问题，以及边缘-云协同推理系统中的高延迟和特征传输成本问题

Method: 引入学习型脉冲驱动压缩模块减少数据传输，采用动态早退机制基于输出置信度自适应终止推理

Result: 数据传输减少2048倍，边缘能耗降低90%以上，端到端延迟降低3倍，精度损失小于2%

Conclusion: NeuCODEX能够在资源受限环境中实现实用、高性能的SNN部署

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling
energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN
inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy
constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud
co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is
often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these
issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that
jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a
learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs
a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on
output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and
Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To
demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16
backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data
transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing
end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a
negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables
practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained

Conclusion: 通过引入鲁棒先验和场景对应学习，成功提升了自监督立体匹配在恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: Recent self-supervised stereo matching methods have made significant
progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather
conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses
contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces
noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with
degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded
regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective
supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these
challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual
foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature
representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene
correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than
relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we
create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These
datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic
context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this
knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of
two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse
weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from
clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under
adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 该方法在息肉大小和精确定位检测方面表现出鲁棒性，具有临床应用的潜力，可用于AI辅助结直肠癌筛查。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC), a lethal disease, begins with the growth of abnormal
mucosal cell proliferation called polyps in the inner wall of the colon. When
left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the
standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and
removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be
inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on
deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time
diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based
polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data
augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our
pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp
datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12
and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg
dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing
the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and
precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted
colorectal screening.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视觉语言模型(VLMs)的视觉处理机制，基于人类视觉的双流假说，将视觉处理解构为物体识别和空间感知两个独立过程，并提出了相应的优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs通过序列化图像处理视觉信息，这与人类视觉的并行处理方式存在差异，且模型内部机制不透明，阻碍了深入理解和架构创新。

Method: 将视觉处理解构为物体识别和空间感知：1）物体识别方面，将图像转换为文本标记图，分析从浅层到深层的两阶段处理过程；2）空间感知方面，理论推导和实验验证位置表示的几何结构。基于发现提出了指令无关的标记压缩算法和RoPE缩放技术。

Result: 验证了VLM内部处理机制的分析，物体识别确实经历从属性识别到语义消歧的两阶段过程，空间感知具有特定的几何结构。提出的优化方法能有效提升解码效率和空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解VLM内部机制提供了深入见解，并为设计更强大的未来架构提供了明确的设计原则。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual
information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from
the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms
hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the
dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and
"where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object
recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition,
we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of
image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers,
beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic
disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically
verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in
VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token
compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve
decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning.
Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a
deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for
designing more capable future architectures.

Motivation: 传统对比学习的视觉语言模型存在浅层语言理解、模态鸿沟、计算成本高和隐私问题等局限性，需要更高效且隐私友好的替代方案。

Method: 采用文本到文本检索范式，使用VLLM生成结构化图像描述，仅需少量GPU小时进行校准，无需视觉编码器。

Conclusion: 视觉无关的检索方法不仅性能优越，还提供了更隐私友好的替代方案，证明了在检索任务中视觉编码器的非必要性。

Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have
become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language
representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language
understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are
reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap.
Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training
makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy
concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the
necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free,
single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image
retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance
of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this
paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of
the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short
and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration
on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions
introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess
generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality
benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO,
containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin
subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses
traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and
compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters. Code is

Motivation: 当前对比视觉语言模型在处理长而密集的标题时存在挑战，作者假设组合性（推理对象-属性绑定和对象间关系的能力）是理解长标题的关键。

Method: 训练和评估了一系列针对组合性和长标题理解能力的模型，研究了不同训练策略和数据质量对性能的影响。

Result: 发现组合性训练能提升长标题检索性能，长标题训练也能促进组合性，但这些增益对数据质量和模型设计敏感。高质量的长标题数据训练可以在两个任务上都取得强性能。

Conclusion: 组合性理解和长标题理解是相互交织的能力，可以通过在密集、有基础描述的标题上进行训练来共同学习，为改进VLM泛化提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
binding visual and textual information, but understanding long, dense captions
remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity
to reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is
key to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking
whether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a
range of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a
bidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on
long-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes
compositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model
design. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited
parameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that
aim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do
not improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional
understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that
can be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions.
Despite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality,
long-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering
practical guidance for improving VLM generalization.

Abstract: Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery remains a significant
challenge for high throughput field phenotyping, particularly in outdoor
environments where low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent
occlusions hinder performance. To address this, we present a framework that
leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and
GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal
images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures
of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop
and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as
five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using
various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few
labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the
weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline.
Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using
CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results
demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and
cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost
segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

Abstract: Evaluation of hydrocephalus in children is challenging, and the related
research is limited by a lack of publicly available, expert-annotated datasets,
particularly those with segmentation of the choroid plexus. To address this, we
present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with
hydrocephalus. 3D MRIs were provided with 1mm isotropic resolution, which was
reconstructed from routine low-resolution images using a slice-to-volume
algorithm. Manually corrected segmentations of brain tissues, including white
matter, grey matter, lateral ventricle, external CSF, and the choroid plexus,
were provided by an experienced neurologist. Additionally, structured data was
extracted from clinical radiology reports using a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation framework. The strong correlation between choroid plexus volume and
total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation,
achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The
proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging
algorithms development, and it revealed the choroid plexus-related features in
hydrocephalus assessments. Our datasets are publicly available at

Conclusion: MsFIN通过多尺度特征融合和上下文交互建模实现了优越性能，为行车记录仪视角的早期事故预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer
vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has
become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges
persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often
occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal
behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a
Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage
accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for
multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale
feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a
Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term,
mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture
is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature
processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under
causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network
fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a
comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show
that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale
feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation
studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how
the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion
and contextual interaction modeling.

Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses
significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse
evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection
capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types
of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with
limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned
forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant
and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously
evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical
infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face
forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to
develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual
experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and
refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental
information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting,
we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the
established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the
orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the
training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and
manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

Abstract: What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar
when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated
based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare
videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been
thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on
broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video
understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural
language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video
Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by
computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key
semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video
similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video
retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new
benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains.
Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions
of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several
state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with
human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on
ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating
video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable
resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.

Abstract: Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer
vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient
compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion
dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework
with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while
preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense
motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates
reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment
observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic
dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming
the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%.
Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion
complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a
compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much
larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish
practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图-放射组学学习（GrRAiL）描述符，用于在临床MRI扫描中表征病灶内异质性，通过图论方法量化病灶内空间关联，在区分肿瘤复发与放射效应方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在常规影像中可靠区分恶性肿瘤与混淆病理的挑战，传统放射组学方法常忽略复杂的空间关系，需要更有效的方法来捕捉病灶内异质性。

Method: GrRAiL方法：1）使用逐体素放射组学测量识别亚区域簇；2）计算图论指标量化簇间空间关联；生成的加权图编码ROI内高阶空间关系。

Result: 在947名受试者的多中心评估中，GrRAiL在三个应用场景均显著优于现有方法：胶质母细胞瘤（测试准确率78%，提升>10%）、脑转移瘤（74%，提升>13%）、胰腺IPMN风险分层（75%，提升>10%）。

Conclusion: GrRAiL能够可靠捕捉病灶内异质性，有效区分恶性肿瘤与混淆病理，在临床MRI应用中表现出优越性能，为肿瘤诊断提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing
confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While
radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI,
many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex
spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new
Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional
heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of
sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes
graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The
resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the
ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies
from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was
evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor
recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain
metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional
setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In
GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs
pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over
comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs
radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk
stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10%
improvement.

TL;DR: CLOPS是首个仅使用自我中心视觉来感知环境和导航的人类化身，通过将低级运动技能学习与高级视觉控制解耦来实现人类化运动特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类运动生成方法忽视了感知与运动之间的相互依赖关系，使用的感知方式与人类感知差异很大。作者认为生成人类化化身行为需要人类化的感知方式。

Method: 首先在大型运动捕捉数据集上训练运动先验模型，然后使用Q学习训练策略，将自我中心视觉输入映射到运动先验的高级控制命令。

Result: 实验证明自我中心视觉能够使化身产生人类化运动特征，例如化身会根据视觉场中的障碍物调整行走路径以避免碰撞。

Conclusion: 为化身配备人类化传感器（特别是自我中心视觉）有望训练出行为像人类的化身。

Abstract: The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is
how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human
motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific
``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the
generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception.
Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely
uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision
as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge
for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion,
without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by
decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level
control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model
on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning
to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion
prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give
rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the
avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field.
These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors,
particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave
like humans.

TL;DR: 该论文针对布局到图像生成中边界框重叠问题，提出了OverLayScore评估指标和OverLayBench基准，并开发了CreatiLayout-AM模型来处理复杂重叠场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有布局到图像生成方法在处理边界框显著重叠时表现不佳，特别是大重叠区域和语义区分度小的重叠实例。现有基准存在偏向简单案例的偏差。

Method: 引入OverLayScore量化边界框重叠复杂度；构建OverLayBench基准，包含高质量标注和平衡的OverLayScore分布；开发CreatiLayout-AM模型，在精心策划的无模态掩码数据集上微调。

Result: 分析显示现有基准偏向低OverLayScore的简单情况；新基准提供了更全面的评估环境；CreatiLayout-AM作为改进复杂重叠性能的初步方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为在现实和挑战性场景下实现更鲁棒的布局到图像生成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still
struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We
identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2)
overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both
qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these
factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we
introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of
overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are
biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their
effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging
conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark
featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different
levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on
complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a
curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for
more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging
scenarios. Project link: https://mlpc-ucsd.github.io/OverLayBench.

*Weijie Wang,Yeqing Chen,Zeyu Zhang,Hengyu Liu,Haoxiao Wang,Zhiyuan Feng,Wenkang Qin,Zheng Zhu,Donny Y. Chen,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VolSplat提出了一种新的多视图前馈3D高斯溅射方法，用体素对齐的高斯预测替代像素对齐方法，解决了现有方法对输入视图数量的依赖、视角偏差密度分布和对齐误差等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的像素对齐高斯预测方法存在三个主要问题：重建的3D模型严重依赖输入视图数量、导致视角偏差密度分布、在源视图存在遮挡或低纹理时引入对齐误差。

Method: VolSplat采用体素对齐的高斯预测范式，直接从预测的3D体素网格预测高斯，避免了像素对齐方法对易出错的2D特征匹配的依赖，确保鲁棒的多视图一致性，并能基于3D场景复杂度自适应控制高斯密度。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和ScanNet等基准测试中，VolSplat实现了最先进的性能，产生更合理和视图一致的高斯重建，具有更忠实的高斯点云、改进的几何一致性和增强的新视角渲染质量。

Conclusion: VolSplat不仅取得了优越的结果，还为前馈3D重建建立了一个更可扩展的框架，具有更密集和更鲁棒的表示，为更广泛社区的研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective
solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a
pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a
3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several
inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent
on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and
introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions
or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new
multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with
voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D
voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature
matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables
adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding
more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and
enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent
Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach
establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with
denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in
wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on
our project page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat.

TL;DR: CAR-Flow是一种条件感知重参数化方法，通过轻量级学习偏移来调整源分布和目标分布，缩短概率路径，加速流匹配模型的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散和流匹配方法需要模型同时学习质量传输和条件注入，增加了模型负担。CAR-Flow旨在通过条件感知重参数化来简化这一过程。

Method: 提出CAR-Flow方法，通过学习轻量级的偏移来条件化源分布、目标分布或两者，从而缩短概率路径。该方法引入的参数极少（<0.6%）。

Result: 在低维合成数据上验证了CAR的效果；在ImageNet-256上，将SiT-XL/2的FID从2.07降至1.68，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: CAR-Flow通过简单的条件感知重参数化有效提升了流匹配模型的训练效率和生成质量，是一种高效的条件生成建模方法。

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution
from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and
flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a
learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that
ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence
required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the
demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow
Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source,
the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow
shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training
in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the
effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256),
equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while
introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了XMUspeech系统在ASVspoof 5挑战赛语音深度伪造检测赛道中的提交成果，通过多尺度特征融合和自适应方法显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASVspoof 5数据库的音频时长显著增加，仅调整输入音频长度就能大幅改善系统性能，因此需要开发更有效的检测方法来应对这一挑战。

Method: 探索了AASIST、HM-Conformer、Hubert和Wav2vec2等多种模型，使用包含伪造语音的数据集训练自监督模型作为特征提取器，并应用自适应多尺度特征融合（AMFF）方法整合Transformer层特征和手工特征。

Result: 在封闭条件下获得minDCF 0.4783和EER 20.45%，在开放条件下获得minDCF 0.2245和EER 9.36%的优异性能。

Conclusion: 提出的多尺度特征融合方法和优化的损失函数配置能有效提升语音深度伪造检测能力，特别是在处理长音频时表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our submitted XMUspeech systems to the speech
deepfake detection track of the ASVspoof 5 Challenge. Compared to previous
challenges, the audio duration in ASVspoof 5 database has significantly
increased. And we observed that merely adjusting the input audio length can
substantially improve system performance. To capture artifacts at multiple
levels, we explored the performance of AASIST, HM-Conformer, Hubert, and
Wav2vec2 with various input features and loss functions. Specifically, in order
to obtain artifact-related information, we trained self-supervised models on
the dataset containing spoofing utterances as the feature extractors. And we
applied an adaptive multi-scale feature fusion (AMFF) method to integrate
features from multiple Transformer layers with the hand-crafted feature to
enhance the detection capability. In addition, we conducted extensive
experiments on one-class loss functions and provided optimized configurations
to better align with the anti-spoofing task. Our fusion system achieved a
minDCF of 0.4783 and an EER of 20.45% in the closed condition, and a minDCF of
0.2245 and an EER of 9.36% in the open condition.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了MNV-17数据集，这是一个7.55小时的表演性中文语音数据集，专门用于提升自动语音识别系统对非语言发声的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流ASR系统擅长转录词汇内容，但无法识别嵌入语音中的非语言发声（如叹息、笑声、咳嗽等），而这些发声传达了重要的情感和意图线索。现有研究缺乏高质量、标注良好的数据集。

Method: 创建了MNV-17数据集，包含17个不同且平衡的非语言发声类别，采用表演性录制确保高质量的发声实例。在四种主流ASR架构上进行了基准测试，评估其在语义转录和NV分类上的联合性能。

Result: MNV-17提供了最广泛的非语言发声类别集合，数据集和预训练模型检查点将公开可用。

Conclusion: MNV-17数据集将促进表达性ASR的未来研究，填补了非语言发声识别领域的数据集空白。

Abstract: Mainstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems excel at transcribing
lexical content, but largely fail to recognize nonverbal vocalizations (NVs)
embedded in speech, such as sighs, laughs, and coughs. This capability is
important for a comprehensive understanding of human communication, as NVs
convey crucial emotional and intentional cues. Progress in NV-aware ASR has
been hindered by the lack of high-quality, well-annotated datasets. To address
this gap, we introduce MNV-17, a 7.55-hour performative Mandarin speech
dataset. Unlike most existing corpora that rely on model-based detection,
MNV-17's performative nature ensures high-fidelity, clearly articulated NV
instances. To the best of our knowledge, MNV-17 provides the most extensive set
of nonverbal vocalization categories, comprising 17 distinct and well-balanced
classes of common NVs. We benchmarked MNV-17 on four mainstream ASR
architectures, evaluating their joint performance on semantic transcription and
NV classification. The dataset and the pretrained model checkpoints will be
made publicly available to facilitate future research in expressive ASR.

TL;DR: StereoFoley是一个视频到音频生成框架，能够产生语义对齐、时间同步且空间准确的48kHz立体声。该工作通过合成数据生成和精细调优，解决了现有模型在立体声成像方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频到音频生成模型虽然在语义和时间保真度上表现良好，但大多局限于单声道或无法实现对象感知的立体声成像，主要受限于缺乏专业混合的空间准确数据集。

Method: 首先训练一个基础模型生成立体声，然后开发合成数据生成管道（结合视频分析、对象跟踪和音频合成），最后在合成数据上微调基础模型以实现对象-音频对应关系。

Result: 该框架在语义准确性和同步性方面达到最先进水平，并通过人类听力研究验证了立体声对象感知能力与感知之间的强相关性。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了首个端到端的立体声对象感知视频到音频生成框架，填补了关键空白并为该领域设立了新基准。

Abstract: We present StereoFoley, a video-to-audio generation framework that produces
semantically aligned, temporally synchronized, and spatially accurate stereo
sound at 48 kHz. While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong
semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to
deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally
mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train
a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art
in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset
limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines
video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and
distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware
sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding
clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we
introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human
listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work
establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware
video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new
benchmark in the field.

Motivation: 辅助犬的吠叫样本数据稀疏且存在伦理约束，传统分类方法受限，需要新的分析框架

Method: 使用调整后的孪生网络，基于样本对之间的序数和数值距离进行训练，而非二元相似性

Result: 在挑战性的效价维度上，模型将周转百分比降低了50%，在真实数据集上验证了学习空间具有语义意义

Conclusion: 该方法为在严重数据限制下分析犬吠建立了概念验证，证明了连续回归方法的有效性

Abstract: Standard classification of canine vocalisations is severely limited for
assistance dogs, where sample data is sparse and variable across dogs and where
capture of the full range of bark types is ethically constrained. We reframe
this problem as a continuous regression task within a two-dimensional
arousal-valence space. Central to our approach is an adjusted Siamese Network
trained not on binary similarity, but on the ordinal and numeric distance
between input sample pairs. Trained on a public dataset, our model reduces
Turn-around Percentage by up to 50% on the challenging valence dimension
compared to a regression baseline. Qualitative validation on a real-world
dataset confirms the learned space is semantically meaningful, establishing a
proof-of-concept for analysing canine barking under severe data limitations.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法需要标记数据进行训练，限制了在少数物种和数据集上的应用，需要开发无需专家标注的无监督方法

Method: 首先检测音节事件，然后聚类提取音节模板，最后通过匹配追踪将录音分解为音节序列

Result: 在Bengalese finch歌曲数据集上，无监督方法取得了与人工标注相媲美的高性能，并能区分同一物种内的不同个体

Conclusion: 该方法为鸟类个体识别和动物通信研究提供了有效的无监督解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力

Abstract: Identifying sequences of syllables within birdsongs is key to tackling a wide
array of challenges, including bird individual identification and better
understanding of animal communication and sensory-motor learning. Recently,
machine learning approaches have demonstrated great potential to alleviate the
need for experts to label long audio recordings by hand. However, they still
typically rely on the availability of labelled data for model training,
restricting applicability to a few species and datasets. In this work, we build
the first fully unsupervised algorithm to decompose birdsong recordings into
sequences of syllables. We first detect syllable events, then cluster them to
extract templates --syllable representations-- before performing matching
pursuit to decompose the recording as a sequence of syllables. We evaluate our
automatic annotations against human labels on a dataset of Bengalese finch
songs and find that our unsupervised method achieves high performance. We also
demonstrate that our approach can distinguish individual birds within a species
through their unique vocal signatures, for both Bengalese finches and another
species, the great tit.

Conclusion: Scattering Transformer在资源受限环境下是一个可行且有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: In an attempt to address the need for skilled clinicians in heart sound
interpretation, recent research efforts on automating cardiac auscultation have
explored deep learning approaches. The majority of these approaches have been
based on supervised learning that is always challenged in occasions where
training data is limited. More recently, there has been a growing interest in
potentials of pre-trained self-supervised audio foundation models for
biomedical end tasks. Despite exhibiting promising results, these foundational
models are typically computationally intensive. Within the context of automatic
cardiac auscultation, this study explores a lightweight alternative to these
general-purpose audio foundation models by introducing the Scattering
Transformer, a novel, training-free transformer architecture for heart murmur
detection. The proposed method leverages standard wavelet scattering networks
by introducing contextual dependencies in a transformer-like architecture
without any backpropagation. We evaluate our approach on the public CirCor
DigiScope dataset, directly comparing it against leading general-purpose
foundational models. The Scattering Transformer achieves a Weighted
Accuracy(WAR) of 0.786 and an Unweighted Average Recall(UAR) of 0.697,
demonstrating performance highly competitive with contemporary state of the art
methods. This study establishes the Scattering Transformer as a viable and
promising alternative in resource-constrained setups.

Method: 提出了轻量级RL框架，在ASR任务中使用基于规则的奖励函数和GRPO框架，在TTS任务中比较GRPO与DiffRO方法，并将两者结合以提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，即使使用有限的训练数据和少量优化步骤，强化学习也能显著提升ASR和TTS系统的性能。

Conclusion: 强化学习在音频处理任务中具有重要应用价值，所提出的框架为音频LLMs的RL应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have played an important role
in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. While
reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced LLM performance in
text-based tasks, its application to ASR and TTS remains underexplored due to
the complexity of training audio-based models. In this study, we propose a
lightweight RL framework tailored for audio-based LLMs that can process audio
inputs and generate audio outputs. Based on this framework, we evaluate the
effectiveness of reinforcement learning on both ASR and TTS tasks. For the ASR
task, we experiment with different rule-based reward functions within the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and investigate the impact of RL
data construction. For the TTS task, we compare GRPO with Differentiable Reward
Optimization (DiffRO) and further combine the two approaches to achieve
improved performance. Our experiments demonstrate that RL can significantly
enhance the performance of both ASR and TTS systems, even with limited training
data and a small number of optimization steps.

Abstract: The evaluation of audio fingerprinting at a realistic scale is limited by the
scarcity of large public music databases. We present an audio-free approach
that synthesises latent fingerprints which approximate the distribution of real
fingerprints. Our method trains a Rectified Flow model on embeddings extracted
by pre-trained neural audio fingerprinting systems. The synthetic fingerprints
generated using our system act as realistic distractors and enable the
simulation of retrieval performance at a large scale without requiring
additional audio. We assess the fidelity of synthetic fingerprints by comparing
the distributions to real data. We further benchmark the retrieval performances
across multiple state-of-the-art audio fingerprinting frameworks by augmenting
real reference databases with synthetic distractors, and show that the scaling
trends obtained with synthetic distractors closely track those obtained with
real distractors. Finally, we scale the synthetic distractor database to model
retrieval performance for very large databases, providing a practical metric of
system scalability that does not depend on access to audio corpora.

predicting removed or hidden portions of the input audio spectrogram. With the
Transformer neural architecture at its core, masked spectrogram modeling has
emerged as the prominent approach for learning general purpose audio
representations, a.k.a. audio foundation models. Meanwhile, addressing the
issues of the Transformer architecture, in particular the underlying Scaled
Dot-product Attention operation, which scales quadratically with input sequence
length, has led to renewed interest in recurrent sequence modeling approaches.
Among them, Selective structured state space models (such as Mamba) and
extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) are the two most promising approaches
which have experienced widespread adoption. While the body of work on these two
topics continues to grow, there is currently a lack of an adequate overview
encompassing the intersection of these topics. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive overview of the aforementioned research domains, covering masked
spectrogram modeling and the previously mentioned neural sequence modeling
architectures, Mamba and xLSTM. Further, we compare Transformers, Mamba and
xLSTM based masked spectrogram models in a unified, reproducible framework on
ten diverse downstream audio classification tasks, which will help interested
readers to make informed decisions regarding suitability of the evaluated
approaches to adjacent applications.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为集成桥梁来协调多个音乐信息检索（MIR）工具的新方法，特别关注提升自动和弦识别性能。通过将音频信息转换为文本表示，让LLMs能够基于音乐理论知识进行推理和修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIR工具虽然各自在特定任务上表现优异，但缺乏有效的集成机制。本文旨在探索LLMs如何作为智能协调器，整合多个最先进的MIR工具输出，以提升和弦识别的整体性能。

Method: 设计了一个5阶段思维链框架，将音频信息转换为文本表示，让GPT-4o能够系统分析、比较和精炼和弦识别结果。该方法整合了音乐源分离、调性检测、和弦识别和节拍跟踪等多个MIR工具的输出。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验评估显示，该方法在多个评估指标上均取得一致改进，在MIREX指标上总体准确率提升了1-2.77%。

Conclusion: LLMs能够有效作为MIR流程中的集成桥梁，为音乐信息检索任务中的多工具协调开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Music Information Retrieval (MIR) encompasses a broad range of computational
techniques for analyzing and understanding musical content, with recent deep
learning advances driving substantial improvements. Building upon these
advances, this paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can serve as an
integrative bridge to connect and integrate information from multiple MIR
tools, with a focus on enhancing automatic chord recognition performance. We
present a novel approach that positions text-based LLMs as intelligent
coordinators that process and integrate outputs from diverse state-of-the-art
MIR tools-including music source separation, key detection, chord recognition,
and beat tracking. Our method converts audio-derived musical information into
textual representations, enabling LLMs to perform reasoning and correction
specifically for chord recognition tasks. We design a 5-stage chain-of-thought
framework that allows GPT-4o to systematically analyze, compare, and refine
chord recognition results by leveraging music-theoretical knowledge to
integrate information across different MIR components. Experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple
evaluation metrics, with overall accuracy gains of 1-2.77% on the MIREX metric.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively function as integrative
bridges in MIR pipelines, opening new directions for multi-tool coordination in
music information retrieval tasks.

Motivation: 传统离散分类方法难以充分表示语音中复杂的情感内容，利用自然语言描述语音情感为更有效捕捉和表达情感提供了新途径。

Method: 采用情感感知策略与强化学习相结合的方法，使用带有情感感知奖励的组相对策略优化（Emo-GRPO）来精确捕捉情感和语义特征。

Result: 在EmotionTalk数据集上的实验结果表明，MECap-R1在生成情感描述方面表现良好，在准确性和多样性方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: MECap-R1框架通过情感感知强化学习方法有效解决了处理动态灵活字幕的刚性规则缺陷，为语音情感字幕任务提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Captioning (SEC) has emerged as a notable research direction.
The inherent complexity of emotional content in human speech makes it
challenging for traditional discrete classification methods to provide an
adequate representation. Consequently, utilizing natural language to describe
speech emotions presents a novel avenue for more effectively capturing and
expressing affect. In this paper, we propose MECap-R1, a pioneering
emotion-aware policy with reinforcement learning for multimodal emotion
captioning. By employing Group Relative Policy Optimization with emotion-aware
reward (Emo-GRPO), the framework precisely captures the emotion and semantic
features, thereby addressing the shortcomings of rigid rules in handling the
dynamic and flexible nature of captions. Experimental results on the
EmotionTalk dataset demonstrate that MECap-R1 performs well in generating
emotion descriptions and achieves substantial gains in both accuracy and
diversity.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MATA是一种无需训练的方法，通过在自注意力机制中动态调整音频token的注意力权重，解决大型音频-语言模型中音频-文本注意力不平衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型在多模态融合层中往往偏向文本信息而忽视音频信息，这限制了它们在音频推理任务中的性能表现。

Method: MATA在原始注意力评分后介入，仅针对中间层的最后一个token进行动态调整，无需额外参数或计算开销。

Result: 在MMAU和MMAR基准测试中，MATA带来了持续的性能提升，特别是在MMAR上使开源模型首次超越专有模型Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: MATA提供了一种高效的解决方案来缓解注意力偏差，为增强多模态模型的音频处理能力开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) often suffer from audio-textual attention
imbalance, prioritizing text over acoustic information, particularly in the
multi-modal fusion layers of the Transformer architecture. This bias hinders
their ability to fully utilize acoustic cues, causing suboptimal performance on
audio reasoning tasks. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{MATA}, a novel
training-free method that dynamically pushes LALMs to pay \textbf{M}ore
\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{T}o \textbf{A}udio tokens within the self-attention
mechanism. Specifically, MATA intervenes post raw attention scoring, targeting
only the last token in intermediate layers without introducing additional
parameters or computational overhead. Experiments on the MMAU and MMAR
benchmarks confirm MATA's effectiveness, with consistent performance gains.
Notably, on MMAR, MATA enables an open-source model to surpass the proprietary
Gemini 2.0 Flash for the first time. Our work provides an efficient solution to
mitigate attention bias and opens a new research direction for enhancing the
audio-processing capabilities of multi-modal models.

TL;DR: ChiReSSD是一个语音重建框架，专门针对患有语音障碍的儿童，在纠正发音错误的同时保持说话人身份特征，特别是音高和韵律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要基于健康成人语音训练，无法有效处理儿童语音障碍患者的特殊需求。需要开发能够适应儿童语音障碍患者声音特征的语音重建技术。

Method: 采用解耦的、基于风格的TTS重建方法，特别关注音高和韵律的保持，在STAR和TORGO数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在STAR数据集上显著提高了词汇准确性和说话人身份保持度，自动预测与人工专家标注的Pearson相关性达到0.63，在TORGO数据集上也展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于风格的解耦TTS重建方法能够为不同临床人群提供身份保持的语音重建，具有减少人工转录负担的潜力。

Abstract: We present ChiReSSD, a speech reconstruction framework that preserves
children speaker's identity while suppressing mispronunciations. Unlike prior
approaches trained on healthy adult speech, ChiReSSD adapts to the voices of
children with speech sound disorders (SSD), with particular emphasis on pitch
and prosody. We evaluate our method on the STAR dataset and report substantial
improvements in lexical accuracy and speaker identity preservation.
Furthermore, we automatically predict the phonetic content in the original and
reconstructed pairs, where the proportion of corrected consonants is comparable
to the percentage of correct consonants (PCC), a clinical speech assessment
metric. Our experiments show Pearson correlation of 0.63 between automatic and
human expert annotations, highlighting the potential to reduce the manual
transcription burden. In addition, experiments on the TORGO dataset demonstrate
effective generalization for reconstructing adult dysarthric speech. Our
results indicate that disentangled, style-based TTS reconstruction can provide
identity-preserving speech across diverse clinical populations.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个随机动态经济调度与储能（SDED-S）框架，用于评估电池储能系统（BESS）在管理不确定性方面的作用，通过考虑风电和负荷不确定性的时间相关性，并采用分层和重要性采样方法生成场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源在电力系统中的集成，如何在最小化运行成本的同时管理运行灵活性和可靠性变得越来越具有挑战性。电池储能系统（BESS）为解决这些问题提供了一个有前景的解决方案。

Method: 提出SDED-S框架，捕捉风电和负荷不确定性的时间相关性，使用分层和重要性采样方法生成场景，并在改进的IEEE 39节点系统上进行验证，其中部分传统发电机被转换为风电场。

Result: 案例研究表明，战略性BESS部署通过减少可再生能源弃电和调度成本显著提高了系统灵活性。随着BESS规模的增加，可再生能源弃电减少，并在特定风电渗透水平下趋近于零。

Conclusion: 较高的风电渗透率在没有储能时会导致更大的弃电，而在部署BESS时会产生更大的成本节约，这突显了随着可再生能源渗透率增加，对灵活性的需求日益增长。

Abstract: With the integration of renewable energy resources in power systems, managing
operational flexibility and reliability while minimizing operational costs has
become increasingly challenging. Battery energy storage system (BESS) offers a
promising solution to address these issues. This paper presents a stochastic
dynamic economic dispatch with storage (SDED-S) framework to assess the impact
of BESS in managing uncertainty. The temporal correlation between wind and load
uncertainties is captured, with scenarios generated using a method inspired by
stratified and importance sampling. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a
modified IEEE 39-bus system, where selected conventional generators are
converted to wind power plants. Case studies show that strategic BESS
deployment significantly improves system flexibility by reducing renewable
curtailments and dispatch costs. Renewable energy curtailments decrease upon
increasing BESS size and approach zero depending on wind penetration level.
Higher wind penetrations result in greater curtailments without storage and
yield larger cost savings when BESS is deployed, highlighting the growing need
for flexibility as renewable energy penetrations increase.

Motivation: 现有卡尔曼滤波变体在合成数据上的精度评估缺乏系统方法，且存在数值发散问题。本文旨在提供一种能够任意精度评估滤波性能的方法，并克服小速度假设的限制。

Method: 开发了一种具有良好数值特性的新滤波器，不再受小速度假设约束，精度仅由传感器噪声决定。采用启发式检测步骤处理高精度传感器需求，支持9轴IMU或里程计、加速度计和压力传感器的组合配置。

Result: 新滤波器修正了先前卡尔曼滤波变体的发散问题，实现了更高的精度评估能力，特别适用于水下环境轨迹重建等应用场景。

Conclusion: 该方法为卡尔曼滤波在流形上的状态估计提供了更精确的评估框架，扩展了其在复杂环境如水下导航中的应用潜力。

Abstract: This work introduces an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within
the framework of the Kalman filter. Its primary objective is to provide a
methodology enabling the evaluation of the precision of existing Kalman filter
variants with arbitrary accuracy on synthetic data, something that, to the best
of our knowledge, has not been addressed in prior work. To this end, we develop
a new filter that exhibits favorable numerical properties, thereby correcting
the divergences observed in previous Kalman filter variants. In this
formulation, the achievable precision is no longer constrained by the
small-velocity assumption and is determined solely by sensor noise. In
addition, this new filter assumes high precision on the sensors, which, in real
scenarios require a detection step that we define heuristically, allowing one
to extend this approach to scenarios, using either a 9-axis IMU or a
combination of odometry, accelerometer, and pressure sensors. The latter
configuration is designed for the reconstruction of trajectories in underwater
environments.

Conclusion: 提出的分布式策略梯度方法能够有效处理多团队博弈中的分布式策略学习问题，在复杂动态环境中实现良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-agent games in dynamic nonlinear settings are challenging due to the
time-varying interactions among the agents and the non-stationarity of the
(potential) Nash equilibria. In this paper we consider model-free games, where
agent transitions and costs are observed without knowledge of the transition
and cost functions that generate them. We propose a policy gradient approach to
learn distributed policies that follow the communication structure in
multi-team games, with multiple agents per team. Our formulation is inspired by
the structure of distributed policies in linear quadratic games, which take the
form of time-varying linear feedback gains. In the nonlinear case, we model the
policies as nonlinear feedback gains, parameterized by self-attention layers to
account for the time-varying multi-agent communication topology. We demonstrate
that our distributed policy gradient approach achieves strong performance in
several settings, including distributed linear and nonlinear regulation, and
simulated and real multi-robot pursuit-and-evasion games.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distributed state estimation problem for a
continuous-time linear multi-agent system (MAS) composed of $\mathit{m}$ agents
and monitored by the agents themselves. To address this problem, we propose a
distributed observer that enables each agent to reconstruct the state of the
MAS. The main idea is to let each agent $\mathit{i}$ recover the state of agent
$\mathit{j}$ by using leader-follower consensus rules to track agent
$\mathit{j}$'s state estimate, which is generated by agent $\mathit{j}$ itself
using a Luenberger-like estimation rule. Under the assumptions of node-level
observability and topological ordering consistency, we show that the estimation
error dynamics are stabilizable if and only if the communication graph is
strongly connected. Moreover, we discuss the fully distributed design of the
proposed observer, assuming that the agents only know basic MAS configuration
information, such as the homogeneity and the maximum number of allowable
agents. This design ensures that the proposed observer functions correctly when
agents are added or removed. Building on this, we consider cooperative
localization as a distributed estimation problem and develop two fully
distributed localization algorithms that allow agents to track their own and
other agents' positions (and velocities) within the MAS. Finally, we conduct
simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed theoretical
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上通过逆向工程从离散算法推导ODE的方法掩盖了高阶原理，无法真正解释Nesterov算法的加速机制。本文旨在从动力系统角度重新构建理论框架，揭示算法背后的数学严谨性。

Method: 采用无源性和浸入控制方法以及几何奇异摄动理论，构建能够解释加速现象的动力系统模型，而不是从离散算法反向推导ODE。

Result: 该框架能够深入理解Nesterov算法中的各项术语和步骤序列，可扩展到三重动量方法，并解释了Heavy-Ball方法不收敛到最优解的原因。

Conclusion: 从动力系统视角为Nesterov加速算法提供了新的理论解释，揭示了加速现象的本质，为理解优化算法的动力学行为提供了系统性的理论框架。

Abstract: Ever since the original algorithm by Nesterov (1983), the true nature of the
acceleration phenomenon has remained elusive, with various interpretations of
why the method is actually faster. The diagnosis of the algorithm through the
lens of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and the corresponding dynamical
system formulation to explain the underlying dynamics has a rich history. In
the literature, the ODEs that explain algorithms are typically derived by
considering the limiting case of the algorithm maps themselves, that is, an ODE
formulation follows the development of an algorithm. This obfuscates the
underlying higher order principles and thus provides little evidence of the
working of the algorithm. Such has been the case with Nesterov algorithm and
the various analogies used to describe the acceleration phenomena, viz,
momentum associated with the rolling of a Heavy-Ball down a slope, Hessian
damping etc. The main focus of our work is to ideate the genesis of the
Nesterov algorithm from the viewpoint of dynamical systems leading to
demystifying the mathematical rigour behind the algorithm. Instead of reverse
engineering ODEs from discrete algorithms, this work explores tools from the
recently developed control paradigm titled Passivity and Immersion approach and
the Geometric Singular Perturbation theory which are applied to arrive at the
formulation of a dynamical system that explains and models the acceleration
phenomena. This perspective helps to gain insights into the various terms
present and the sequence of steps used in Nesterovs accelerated algorithm for
the smooth strongly convex and the convex case. The framework can also be
extended to derive the acceleration achieved using the triple momentum method
and provides justifications for the non-convergence to the optimal solution in
the Heavy-Ball method.

Conclusion: 阈值型策略在云服务器繁忙时能有效优化系统延迟，仿真结果验证了该策略结构的合理性。

Abstract: We consider a simple computation offloading model where jobs can either be
fully processed in the cloud or be partially processed at a local server before
being sent to the cloud to complete processing. Our goal is to design a policy
for assigning jobs to service modes, i.e., full offloading or partial
offloading, based on the state of the system, in order to minimize delay in the
system. We show that when the cloud server is idle, the optimal policy is to
assign the next job in the system queue to the cloud for processing. However,
when the cloud server is busy, we show that, under mild assumptions, the
optimal policy is of a threshold type, that sends the next job in the system
queue to the local server if the queue exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, we
demonstrate this policy structure through simulations.

Abstract: This work establishes a robust mathematical foundation for compositional
System Dynamics modeling, leveraging category theory to formalize and enhance
the representation, analysis, and composition of system models. Here, System
Dynamics diagrams, such as stock & flow diagrams, system structure diagrams,
and causal loop diagrams, are formulated as categorical constructs, enabling
scalable, transparent, and systematic reasoning. By encoding these diagrams as
data using attributed C-sets and utilizing advanced categorical tools like
structured cospans, pushouts, pullbacks, and functor mappings, the framework
supports modular composition, stratification, and seamless mapping between
syntax and semantics.
  The approach underwrites traditional practice with firm mathematical
structure, facilitates the identification of certain forms of pathways and
feedback loops, the detection of simple patterns within complex diagrams,
common structure between diagrams, and structure-preserving mappings between
diverse diagram types. Additionally, this framework supports alternative
semantics, such as stochastic transition dynamics, extending beyond traditional
ordinary differential equation (ODE) representations. Applications in
compositional modeling, modularity, and team-based collaboration demonstrate
the practical advantages of this advanced framework.
  Future directions include integrating dimensional annotations, supporting
hybrid and agent-based modeling paradigms, and expanding the framework's
applicability to global and local temporal reasoning through temporal sheaves.
By revealing and formalizing the hidden mathematical structure of System
Dynamics diagrams, this work empowers practitioners to tackle complex systems
with clarity, scalability, and rigor.

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了所提方法的有效性，为安全关键随机系统提供了更广泛适用的概率安全保证工具。

Abstract: Providing finite-time probabilistic safety and reach-avoid guarantees is
crucial for safety-critical stochastic systems. Existing barrier certificate
methods often rely on a restrictive boundedness assumption for auxiliary
functions, limiting their applicability. This paper presents refined
barrier-like conditions that remove this assumption. Specifically, we establish
conditions for deriving upper bounds on finite-time safety probabilities in
discrete-time systems and lower bounds on finite-time reach-avoid probabilities
in continuous-time systems. This key relaxation significantly expands the class
of verifiable systems, especially those with unbounded state spaces, and
facilitates the application of advanced optimization techniques, such as
semi-definite programming with polynomial functions. The efficacy of our
approach is validated through numerical examples.

Abstract: The vision of 6G communication demands autonomous and resilient networking in
environments without fixed infrastructure. Yet most multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) approaches focus on isolated stages - exploration, relay
formation, or access - under static deployments and centralized control,
limiting adaptability. We propose the AI Agent Access (A\^3) Network, a
unified, embodied intelligence-driven framework that transforms multi-agent
networking into a dynamic, decentralized, and end-to-end system. Unlike prior
schemes, the A\^3 Network integrates exploration, target user access, and
backhaul maintenance within a single learning process, while supporting
on-demand agent addition during runtime. Its decentralized policies ensure that
even a single agent can operate independently with limited observations, while
coordinated agents achieve scalable, communication-optimized coverage. By
embedding link-level communication metrics into actor-critic learning, the A\^3
Network couples topology formation with robust decision-making. Numerical
simulations demonstrate that the A\^3 Network not only balances exploration and
communication efficiency but also delivers system-level adaptability absent in
existing MARL frameworks, offering a new paradigm for 6G multi-agent networks.

warnings can enable more proactive driver assistance system and support more
informed decision-making for drivers under LCs. This paper presents an
interaction-aware Lane-Changing Early Warning (LCEW) system designed to issue
reliable early warning signals based on future trajectory predictions. We first
investigate the stochastic nature of LCs, characterized by (i) variable-size
multi-vehicle interactions and (ii) the direct and indirect risks resulting
from these interactions. To model these stochastic interactions, a Social
Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network framework informed by mutual
information (STGCNN-MI) is introduced to predict multi-vehicle trajectories. By
leveraging a MI-based adjacency matrix, the framework enhances trajectory
prediction accuracy while providing interpretable representations of vehicle
interactions. Then, potential collisions between the LC vehicle and adjacent
vehicles (direct risks) or among the non-adjacent vehicles (indirect risks) are
identified using oriented bounding box detection applied to the predicted
trajectories. Finally, a warning signal is generated to inform the LC driver of
location of potential collisions within the predicted time window. Traffic
simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate that the proposed
interaction-aware LCEW improves both vehicle-level safety and overall traffic
efficiency, while also promoting more natural behavioral adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MIMO双迭代学习控制（DILC）的新型数据驱动迭代学习方案，能够在无需先验系统知识或手动参数调整的情况下，同时实现跟踪控制和模型学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多输入多输出（MIMO）系统中未知动态和手动参数调优的挑战，实现真正自主的智能系统运动任务控制。

Method: 设计了一种针对重复性MIMO系统的双迭代学习控制方案，该方案与现有迭代学习控制方法无缝集成，并为线性时不变系统提供了参考跟踪误差和模型误差的单调收敛条件。

Result: DILC方案在高保真工业机器人仿真和多个非线性真实世界MIMO系统中快速自主地解决了各种运动任务，许多参考跟踪任务在10-20次试验内解决，复杂运动在不到100次迭代内学习完成。

Conclusion: 由于其快速自主的学习能力，DILC有潜力作为复杂学习框架中的高效构建模块，用于智能真实世界系统。

Abstract: Solving motion tasks autonomously and accurately is a core ability for
intelligent real-world systems. To achieve genuine autonomy across multiple
systems and tasks, key challenges include coping with unknown dynamics and
overcoming the need for manual parameter tuning, which is especially crucial in
complex Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems.
  This paper presents MIMO Dual Iterative Learning Control (DILC), a novel
data-driven iterative learning scheme for simultaneous tracking control and
model learning, without requiring any prior system knowledge or manual
parameter tuning. The method is designed for repetitive MIMO systems and
integrates seamlessly with established iterative learning control methods. We
provide monotonic convergence conditions for both reference tracking error and
model error in linear time-invariant systems.
  The DILC scheme -- rapidly and autonomously -- solves various motion tasks in
high-fidelity simulations of an industrial robot and in multiple nonlinear
real-world MIMO systems, without requiring model knowledge or manually tuning
the algorithm. In our experiments, many reference tracking tasks are solved
within 10-20 trials, and even complex motions are learned in less than 100
iterations. We believe that, because of its rapid and autonomous learning
capabilities, DILC has the potential to serve as an efficient building block
within complex learning frameworks for intelligent real-world systems.

Abstract: This article examines state estimation in discrete-time nonlinear stochastic
systems with finite-dimensional states and infinite-dimensional measurements,
motivated by real-world applications such as vision-based localization and
tracking. We develop an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for real-time state
estimation, with the measurement noise modeled as an infinite-dimensional
random field. When applied to vision-based state estimation, the measurement
Jacobians required to implement the EKF are shown to correspond to image
gradients. This result provides a novel system-theoretic justification for the
use of image gradients as features for vision-based state estimation,
contrasting with their (often heuristic) introduction in many computer-vision
pipelines. We demonstrate the practical utility of the EKF on a public
real-world dataset involving the localization of an aerial drone using video
from a downward-facing monocular camera. The EKF is shown to outperform
VINS-MONO, an established visual-inertial odometry algorithm, in some cases
achieving mean squared error reductions of up to an order of magnitude.

Abstract: This paper proposes the integration of Concentrated Solar Power Plant (CSP)
in the Renewable-only virtual power plant (RVPP) for bidding in the electricity
day-ahead and secondary reserve markets, as well as trading thermal energy
through a heat purchase agreement. A reformulated two-stage robust optimization
approach is introduced to account for multiple uncertainties, including
electricity prices, non-dispatchable renewable energy sources electrical
production, CSP thermal production, and uncertainties in electrical and thermal
demand consumption. The provision of energy and reserve by the thermal storage
of CSP is modeled using an adjustable approach, which allocates a share of
energy for up and down reserves based on the profitability of the RVPP.
Simulations are conducted for several case studies to demonstrate the
effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach under
different RVPP operator decisions against uncertain parameters and various
trading strategies for electricity and thermal energy. The simulation results
show that integrating CSP into RVPP enhances RVPP flexibility for both
electrical and thermal trading. Furthermore, the results indicate that the
profitability of the RVPP increases when all trading options are considered,
across different levels of conservatism adopted by the RVPP operator in
response to uncertain parameters.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于聚合响应单元（ARU）的频率变化优化（FVO）框架，通过将FVO问题转化为最优轨迹跟踪（TOT）问题，实现在线优化，确保在固定时间内收敛到最优轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为应对可再生能源发电的波动性，需要更快更有效的频率响应服务。英国国家能源系统运营商（NESO）引入了三种新的动态服务，其中资产聚合起着关键作用。

Method: 将频率变化优化（FVO）问题重新表述为最优轨迹跟踪（TOT）问题，提出了两种场景的算法：一种是资产动态可忽略的情况，另一种是需要考虑资产动态的情况。

Result: 在合理条件下，ARU能在固定时间内收敛到最优轨迹，并且在NESO要求的最大交付时间内完成。数值结果验证了控制框架的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架可以轻松分布式协调大量资产，为解决可再生能源波动性带来的频率响应挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: To address the variability of renewable generation, initiatives have been
launched globally to provide faster and more effective frequency responses. In
the UK, the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has introduced a suite of
three new dynamic services, where aggregation of assets is expected to play a
key role. For an Aggregated Response Unit (ARU), the required level of
frequency response varies with grid frequency, resulting in a frequency-varying
equality constraint that assets should meet collectively. We show that the
optimal coordination of an ARU constitutes a Frequency-Varying Optimization
(FVO) problem, in which the optimal trajectory for each asset evolves
dynamically. To facilitate online optimization, we reformulate the FVO problem
into Tracking of the Optimal Trajectory (TOT) problems, with algorithms
proposed for two scenarios: one where the asset dynamics are negligible, and
another where they must be accounted for. Under reasonable conditions, the ARU
converges to the optimal trajectory within a fixed time, and within the maximum
delivery time requested by NESO. The proposed framework can be readily
distributed to coordinate a large number of assets. Numerical results verify
the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed control framework.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应覆盖不安全动作的方法，用于处理高相对度非超调约束和参数不确定性下的控制器安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在参数不确定性的情况下，传统控制器可能产生不安全动作，需要设计能够自适应覆盖这些不安全动作的机制，同时避免与参数估计误差的高阶导数耦合。

Method: 采用模块化设计方法，将控制器和参数识别器分开设计。控制器模块确保参数不确定性引起的安全违规有界，参数识别器模块保证参数估计误差及其一阶导数有界或平方可积。

Result: 理论分析和仿真结果表明，闭环安全违规受初始估计误差的可调函数限制。随着时间推移，参数估计收敛到真实值，安全违规量相应减少。

Conclusion: 该模块化设计方法有效解决了高相对度非超调约束下的自适应安全控制问题，实现了参数估计的收敛和安全性能的逐步改善。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of adaptively overriding unsafe actions of a
nominal controller in the presence of high-relative-degree nonovershooting
constraints and parametric uncertainties. To prevent the design from being
coupled with high-order derivatives of the parameter estimation error, we adopt
a modular design approach in which the controller and the parameter identifier
are designed separately. The controller module ensures that any safety
violations caused by parametric uncertainties remain bounded, provided that the
parameter estimation error and its first-order derivative are either bounded or
square-integrable. The identifier module, in turn, guarantees that these
requirements on the parameter estimation error are satisfied. Both theoretical
analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the closed-loop safety
violation is bounded by a tunable function of the initial estimation error.
Moreover, as time increases, the parameter estimate converges to the true
value, and the amount of safety violation decreases accordingly.

Abstract: As one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, global climate
change demands a host of changes across at least four critical energy
infrastructures: the electric grid, the natural gas system, the oil system, and
the coal system. In the context of the United States, this paper refers to this
system-of-systems as ``The American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES)". These
combined changes necessitate an understanding of the AMES interdependencies,
both structurally and behaviorally, to develop and enact effective policies.
This work focuses on behavioral analysis methods to provide examples of how to
analyze system behavior and the critical matter and energy flows through the
system. Building upon past works, two regions of the AMES are modeled, and
their behavior is analyzed using Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT). More
specifically, the work presents a weighted least square error state estimation
model of the AMES. State estimation has played a major role in the operation
and development of the American Electric Power System. This work extends the
state estimation analysis beyond the single-operand electric grid environment
into the heterogeneous environment of the AMES. Employing a data-driven and
model-based systems engineering approach in combination with HFGT, a Weighted
Least Squares Error Hetero-functional Graph State Estimation (WLSEHFGSE)
optimization program is developed to estimate the optimal flows of mass and
energy through the AMES. This work is the first to integrate state estimation
methods with HFGT. Furthermore, it demonstrates how such a WLSEHFGSE recovers
the mass and energy flows in a system-of-systems like the AMES with asset-level
granularity.

Conclusion: 所提出的MAPPO方法能有效解决边缘服务器监控中的分布式决策问题，在动态环境下实现高性能的查询调度。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a goal-oriented communication problem for edge
server monitoring, where jobs arrive intermittently at multiple dispatchers and
must be assigned to shared edge servers with finite queues and time-varying
availability. Accurate knowledge of server status is critical for sustaining
high throughput, yet remains challenging under dynamic workloads and partial
observability. To address this challenge, each dispatcher maintains server
knowledge through two complementary mechanisms: (i) active status queries that
provide instantaneous updates at a communication cost, and (ii) job execution
feedback that reveals server conditions opportunistically. We formulate a
cooperative multi-agent distributed decision-making problem in which
dispatchers jointly optimize query scheduling to balance throughput against
communication overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm that leverages centralized
training with decentralized execution (CTDE) to learn distributed
query-and-dispatch policies under partial and stale observations. Numerical
evaluations show that MAPPO achieves superior throughput-cost tradeoffs and
significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving on average a 30%
improvement over the closest baseline.

Abstract: This research presents a smart urinary health monitoring system incorporating
a coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed slot-loop antenna biosensor designed to analyse
various urine samples. The antenna demonstrates distinct resonant frequency
shifts when exposed to five specific urine conditions, deviating from its
baseline 1.42 GHz operation. These measurable frequency variations enable the
antenna to function as an effective microwave sensor for urinary biomarker
detection. A potential artificial intelligence-based Convolutional Neural
Networks Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) framework is also discussed to
overcome the limitations of overlapping frequency responses, aiming to improve
the accuracy of health condition detection. These components contribute to the
development of a smart toilet system that displays real-time health information
on a wall-mounted urinal screen, without requiring any user effort or
behavioural change.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based controller design methods often require
substantial data in the initial training phase. Moreover, the training process
tends to exhibit strong randomness and slow convergence. It often requires
considerable time or high computational resources. Another class of
learning-based method incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to obtain a
control policy with stability guarantees. However, these methods generally
require an initially stable neural network control policy at the beginning of
training. Evidently, a stable neural network controller can not only serve as
an initial policy for reinforcement learning, allowing the training to focus on
improving controller performance, but also act as an initial state for
learning-based Lyapunov control methods. Although stable controllers can be
designed using traditional control theory, designers still need to have a great
deal of control design knowledge to address increasingly complicated control
problems. The proposed neural network rapid initialization method in this paper
achieves the initial training of the neural network control policy by
constructing datasets that conform to the stability conditions based on the
system model. Furthermore, using the image-based visual servoing control for
multicopter interception as a case study, simulations and experiments were
conducted to validate the effectiveness and practical performance of the
proposed method. In the experiment, the trained control policy attains a final
interception velocity of 15 m/s.

Conclusion: 提出的前馈-反馈SRF-PLL方案在跟踪角频率和锁定相位角方面表现出优越性能，适用于噪声和时变信号环境。

Abstract: Synchronous reference frame phase-looked loop (SRF-PLL) techniques are widely
used for interfacing and control applications in the power systems and energy
conversion at large. Since a PLL system synchronizes its output with an
exogenous harmonic signal, often 3-phases voltage or current, the locking of
the frequency and phase angle depends on the performance of the feedback loop
with at least two integrator terms, and on the distortions of the measured
input quantities. For the conventional SRF-PLL with a proportional-integral
(PI) control in feedback, we are providing a robust design which maximizes the
phase margin and uses the normalization scheme for yielding the loop
insensitive to the input amplitude variations. The main improvement in the
transient behavior and also in tracking of frequency ramps is achieved by using
the robust feed-forward frequency estimator, which is model-free and suitable
for the noisy and time-varying harmonic signals. The proposed
feed-forward-feedback SRF-PLL scheme is experimentally evaluated on the
3-phases harmonic currents from standard PMSM drives with varying angular
speeds and loads. Both, the tracked angular frequency and locked phase angle
are assessed as performance metrics of the robust SRF-PLL scheme with
feedforwarding.

Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework to jointly schedule water and electricity
in a profit-maximizing renewable colocated water desalination plant that
integrates both thermal and membrane based technologies. The price-taking
desalination plant sells desalinated water to a water utility at a given price
and engages in bidirectional electricity transactions with the grid, purchasing
or selling power based on its net electricity demand. We show that the optimal
scheduling policy depends on the plant's internal renewable generation and
follows a simple threshold structure. Under the optimal policy, thermal based
water output decreases monotonically with renewable output, while membrane
based water output increases monotonically. We characterize the structure and
intuition behind the threshold policy and examine key special properties.

Abstract: We analyze the performance of policy gradient in multitask linear quadratic
regulation (LQR), where the system and cost parameters differ across tasks. The
main goal of multitask LQR is to find a controller with satisfactory
performance on every task. Prior analyses on relevant contexts fail to capture
closed-loop task similarities, resulting in conservative performance
guarantees. To account for such similarities, we propose bisimulation-based
measures of task heterogeneity. Our measures employ new bisimulation functions
to bound the cost gradient distance between a pair of tasks in closed loop with
a common stabilizing controller. Employing these measures, we derive
suboptimality bounds for both the multitask optimal controller and the
asymptotic policy gradient controller with respect to each of the tasks. We
further provide conditions under which the policy gradient iterates remain
stabilizing for every system. For multiple random sets of certain tasks, we
observe that our bisimulation-based measures improve upon baseline measures of
task heterogeneity dramatically.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically
advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media
integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored
zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have
never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied
self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative
model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the
ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention
strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes
before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating
deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity
verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and
blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements,
zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as
adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence
of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by
discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection,
multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for
enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake
detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense
framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in
combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the
important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers,
cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against
the rising tide of deepfake attacks.

Motivation: 现有的辐射场方法牺牲了材质反射特性和光照条件的建模，导致几何歧义且无法进行重光照。虽然基于物理的渲染可以解决这些问题，但全局光照在优化过程中计算成本过高。

Method: 采用高斯面元作为基元，在球谐系数空间中构建可微光传输框架，扩展经典辐射度理论以支持非二元可见性和半透明基元，并提出高效求解器和反向传播方法。

Result: 在推理阶段实现视角无关渲染，无需重新计算光传输即可达到数百FPS的全局光照效果，包括使用球谐表示的视角相关反射。

Conclusion: 通过大量实验证明，该方法在几何重建、视图合成和重光照方面优于现有的逆向渲染基线，在已知或未知光照条件的稀疏数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from
novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of
Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective
properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric
ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address
these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been
prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner
loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that
make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less
accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build
an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the
classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space
of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend
the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives,
propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the
backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than
auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering
where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling
hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent
reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry
reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering
baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known
or unknown lighting conditions.

### [161] [Text Slider: Efficient and Plug-and-Play Continuous Concept Control for Image/Video Synthesis via LoRA Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18831)
*Pin-Yen Chiu,I-Sheng Fang,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Text Slider是一个轻量级、高效的即插即用框架，通过在预训练文本编码器中识别低秩方向，实现对视觉概念的连续控制，显著减少训练时间、GPU内存消耗和可训练参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念控制方法需要大量训练时间和GPU内存来学习滑块或嵌入，并且需要为不同的扩散主干网络重新训练，限制了其可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 在预训练文本编码器中识别低秩方向，实现连续控制视觉概念，支持多概念组合和连续控制。

Result: Text Slider实现了平滑连续的概念属性调制，同时保持输入的空间布局和结构。训练速度比Concept Slider快5倍，比Attribute Control快47倍，GPU内存使用分别减少近2倍和4倍。

Conclusion: Text Slider是一个高效、轻量级的概念控制框架，在图像和视频合成中实现了细粒度和灵活的操作。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and
video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been
proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over
free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive
training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also
need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their
scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text
Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies
low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous
control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU
memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text
Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling
fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We
show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific
attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the
input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster
training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control,
while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$,
respectively.

*Jun Ma,Qian He,Gaofeng He,Huang Chen,Chen Liu,Xiaogang Jin,Huamin Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的框架，用于从单张参考图像中解耦细粒度风格和内容特征，特别针对刺绣等复杂纹理的定制化需求。该方法采用两阶段对比LoRA调制技术，在刺绣定制任务上超越了现有方法，并展示了在艺术风格迁移、素描上色和外观迁移等领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刺绣作为一种具有复杂针迹图案和材料特性的纺织艺术形式，对现有风格迁移方法提出了独特挑战。需要探索针对此类细粒度视觉特征的自定义方法，以满足零售工作流中预售可视化的需求。

Method: 基于图像类比概念，构建图像对定义目标风格，使用预训练扩散模型的解耦表示进行风格-内容分离。提出两阶段对比LoRA调制技术：第一阶段迭代更新整个LoRA和选定风格块初步分离风格与内容；第二阶段通过自知识蒸馏的对比学习策略进一步解耦。构建推理管道处理图像或文本输入。

Result: 在刺绣定制基准测试中超越了现有方法，并在艺术风格迁移、素描上色和外观迁移三个额外领域展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理刺绣等复杂纹理的细粒度风格迁移问题，为零售工作流中的定制化可视化提供了实用解决方案，并具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques,
and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform
retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style
transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is
becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized
by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties,
which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore
the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel
contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content
features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of
image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and
then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of
pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture
fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the
whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from
content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to
further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation.
Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with
only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer,
we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior
methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three
additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and
appearance transfer.

*Anoushka Puranik,Ester Chen,Roshan L Peiris,Ha-Kyung Kong*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨定性研究人员对AI在定性数据分析中三种委托程度（人工编码、人工发起、AI发起）的偏好，发现效率、所有权和信任是影响偏好的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定性研究过程耗时费力，虽然AI工具可以处理大数据集和自动化任务，但研究人员担心AI缺乏情境理解能力且可能削弱工作的协作性和解释性。

Method: 通过对16位定性研究人员进行访谈，研究他们对AI委托程度的偏好及其影响因素。

Result: 研究人员普遍接受AI作为辅助工具，但强调人类监督和自动化透明的重要性。效率、所有权和信任是决定委托程度的关键因素。

Conclusion: 讨论了QDA中AI信任的三个因素，以及加强QDA协作和减少分析偏见的潜在方法。

Abstract: Qualitative research offers deep insights into human experiences, but its
processes, such as coding and thematic analysis, are time-intensive and
laborious. Recent advancements in qualitative data analysis (QDA) tools have
introduced AI capabilities, allowing researchers to handle large datasets and
automate labor-intensive tasks. However, qualitative researchers have expressed
concerns about AI's lack of contextual understanding and its potential to
overshadow the collaborative and interpretive nature of their work. This study
investigates researchers' preferences among three degrees of delegation of AI
in QDA (human-only, human-initiated, and AI-initiated coding) and explores
factors influencing these preferences. Through interviews with 16 qualitative
researchers, we identified efficiency, ownership, and trust as essential
factors in determining the desired degree of delegation. Our findings highlight
researchers' openness to AI as a supportive tool while emphasizing the
importance of human oversight and transparency in automation. Based on the
results, we discuss three factors of trust in AI for QDA and potential ways to
strengthen collaborative efforts in QDA and decrease bias during analysis.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了手持智能手机和头戴式AR系统两种视觉辅助技术对盲人或低视力人群的影响，发现头戴式系统减少上半身运动和时间，手持系统在扫描小或弯曲文本时成功率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同设备形态对盲人或低视力人群使用视觉辅助技术时的物理和功能影响，以优化用户体验设计。

Method: 11名盲人或低视力参与者使用手持智能手机和头戴式AR系统执行六项日常生活活动，通过Xsens运动捕捉系统记录运动数据，分析功能结果和生物力学指标。

Result: 头戴式系统减少上半身运动和任务时间，尤其适合文档扫描类任务；手持系统在处理小或弯曲文本时成功率更高。

Conclusion: 两种设备形态均可行，但在物理需求和易用性上存在差异；将生物力学指标纳入辅助技术评估有助于平衡功能效率、物理可持续性和直观交互。

Abstract: Visual assistive technologies, such as Microsoft Seeing AI, can improve
access to environmental information for persons with blindness or low vision
(pBLV). Yet, the physical and functional implications of different device
embodiments remain unclear. In this study, 11 pBLV participants used Seeing AI
on a hand-held smartphone and on a head-mounted ARx Vision system to perform
six activities of daily living, while their movements were captured with Xsens
motion capture. Functional outcomes included task time, success rate, and
number of attempts, and biomechanical measures included joint range of motion,
angular path length, working volume, and movement smoothness. The head-mounted
system generally reduced upper-body movement and task time, especially for
document-scanning style tasks, whereas the hand-held system yielded higher
success rates for tasks involving small or curved text. These findings indicate
that both embodiments are viable, but they differ in terms of physical demands
and ease of use. Incorporating biomechanical measures into assistive technology
evaluations can inform designs that optimise user experience by balancing
functional efficiency, physical sustainability, and intuitive interaction.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文研究了维基百科上对已撤稿科学论文的引用处理问题，发现71.6%的引用存在问题，且这些引用平均持续超过3.68年。人类关注信号能加速修正过程，但论文的学术权威性反而会延缓修正速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科作为公众获取科学知识的重要基础设施，在维护引用来源可信度方面面临挑战，特别是当科学论文被撤稿时。研究旨在了解英语维基百科如何处理对已撤稿研究的引用。

Method: 构建了一个新颖的数据集，整合了维基百科修订历史与Retraction Watch、Crossref、Altmetric和OpenAlex的元数据，识别了1,181条对已撤稿论文的引用。

Result: 71.6%的引用存在问题（包括撤稿前添加的引用和撤稿后未提及撤稿状态的引用），这些引用持续中位数为3.68年（1,344天）。人类关注信号与更快的修正过程相关，而学术权威性（高引用次数）与较慢的修正时间相关。

Conclusion: 维基百科社区支持协作维护，但在引用层面修复存在差距。研究为CSCW研究做出了贡献，加深了对这种社会技术脆弱性的理解，并提供了支持大规模引用可信度的设计方向。

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a key infrastructure for public access to scientific
knowledge, but it faces challenges in maintaining the credibility of cited
sources, especially when scientific papers are retracted. This paper
investigates how citations to retracted research are handled on English
Wikipedia. We construct a novel dataset that integrates Wikipedia revision
histories with metadata from Retraction Watch, Crossref, Altmetric, and
OpenAlex, identifying 1,181 citations of retracted papers. We find that 71.6%
of all citations analyzed are problematic. These are citations added before a
paper's retraction, as well as the citations introduced after retraction
without any in-text mention of the paper's retracted status. Our analysis
reveals that these citations persist for a median of over 3.68 years (1,344
days). Through survival analysis, we find that signals of human attention are
associated with a faster correction process. Unfortunately, a paper's
established scholarly authority, a higher academic citation count, is
associated with a slower time to correction. Our findings highlight how the
Wikipedia community supports collaborative maintenance but leaves gaps in
citation-level repair. We contribute to CSCW research by advancing our
understanding of this sociotechnical vulnerability, which takes the form of a
community coordination challenge, and by offering design directions to support
citation credibility at scale.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Positive Queue的新型审核系统，通过发现和奖励优质内容来增强Reddit现有的审核界面，以支持积极审核策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社区依赖志愿者版主维持秩序，但现有工具主要关注惩罚措施。研究表明积极反馈能鼓励高质量贡献，版主也请求支持定位和奖励优质内容，但目前缺乏实用工具。

Method: 基于版主的想法，开发了Positive Queue系统，在Reddit现有审核界面中增加发现和奖励理想内容的功能。通过版主用户研究评估系统效果。

Result: 研究发现该系统对不同审核环境都具有价值，能够有效支持积极审核策略的实施。

Conclusion: 提出了将积极审核策略融入现有平台的设计方向和见解，为社区管理提供了新的工具支持。

Abstract: Online communities are constantly growing, with dozens of platforms housing
millions of users. Large and small communities alike rely on volunteer
moderators to maintain order. Despite their key role, moderators are given a
toolbox of punishments and asked to fend off barrages of harmful content.
However, prior research shows that positive feedback may proactively encourage
higher quality contributions and discourage norm violations. Moreover,
moderators themselves have requested support for locating and rewarding content
to encourage in their communities. These requests notwithstanding, there is a
tangible lack of practical support through tools. Building off moderators'
ideas, we build a novel moderation system, the Positive Queue, that augments
Reddit's existing moderator interface with features to discover and reward
desirable content. Through a user study of moderators, we find that the system
has value to vastly different moderation settings. We present design directions
and insights for incorporating positive moderation strategies into existing
spaces.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究通过随机实验模拟Reddit热门feed，发现排名对用户参与度有显著影响（低排名帖子参与度降低40%），但用户很少意识到排名因素，而排名和社会证明对内容感知质量没有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交媒体趋势feed如何通过算法排名和社会证明信号影响用户行为和感知，特别是考察这些信号是否隐含地引导用户注意力。

Method: 采用随机对照实验（n=585），让参与者在模拟的Reddit r/popular feed中查看相同内容但不同排序的帖子，隔离排名和社会证明对参与度和感知的影响。

Result: 低排名帖子参与度降低约40%，但参与者很少报告排名是决策因素；排名和社会证明对相关性、可信度和质量感知没有显著影响；年龄较大参与者对趋势内容更怀疑，教育程度较低者信任度更高。

Conclusion: 算法排序隐含地引导用户注意力，这对平台设计、算法影响研究和政策制定具有重要意义。

Abstract: Social media feeds have become central to the Internet. Among the most
visible are trending feeds, which rank content deemed timely and relevant. To
examine how feed signals influence behaviors and perceptions, we conducted a
randomized experiment (n = 585) simulating Reddit's r/popular feed. By having
participants view identical sets of posts in different orders, we isolate the
effects of rank and social proof on engagement and perceived relevance,
trustworthiness, and quality. We found that lower-ranked posts received about
40% less engagement, despite participants rarely reporting rank as a factor in
their choices. In contrast, neither rank nor social proof shifted perceptions
across the three dimensions. We also observed demographic patterns: older
participants were more skeptical of trending content, while those with less
formal education expressed greater trust. Overall, our findings show that
algorithmic curation implicitly steers attention, with implications for
platform design, research on algorithmic influence, and policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在将null2作为重要的当代世博实践案例进行语境化记录，考察日本从19世纪到21世纪的历史社会背景，世博会作为现代日本'美术'概念诞生、经济发展象征里程碑以及城市媒体文化形成的关键节点。

Method: 通过案例研究法，分析null2的建筑技术、计算机图形学方法、媒体艺术实践和理论背景，结合东方哲学传统和数字自然哲学框架，重新诠释茶室等传统空间结构 motif。

Result: 研究发现null2通过计算的自然化和普及化，实现了参观者身体与建筑空间的实时融合，创造了新的世界观表达方式，为未来世代保存了重要的学术档案。

Conclusion: null2代表了从静态表达到动态沉浸体验的范式转变，将传统东方哲学与当代数字艺术 discourse 相结合，在世博实践史上具有重要的学术价值和档案意义。

Abstract: This paper presents a case study of the thematic pavilion null2 at Expo 2025
Osaka-Kansai, contrasting with the static Jomon motifs of Taro Okamoto's Tower
of the Sun from Expo 1970. The study discusses Yayoi-inspired mirror motifs and
dynamically transforming interactive spatial configuration of null2, where
visitors become integrated as experiential content. The shift from static
representation to a new ontological and aesthetic model, characterized by the
visitor's body merging in real-time with architectural space at installation
scale, is analyzed. Referencing the philosophical context of Expo 1970 theme
'Progress and Harmony for Mankind,' this research reconsiders the worldview
articulated by null2 in Expo 2025, in which computation is naturalized and
ubiquitous, through its intersection with Eastern philosophical traditions. It
investigates how immersive experiences within the pavilion, grounded in the
philosophical framework of Digital Nature, reinterpret traditional spatial and
structural motifs of the tea room, positioning them within contemporary digital
art discourse. The aim is to contextualize and document null2 as an important
contemporary case study from Expo practices, considering the historical and
social background in Japan from the 19th to 21st century, during which world
expositions served as pivotal points for the birth of modern Japanese concept
of 'fine art,' symbolic milestones of economic development, and key moments in
urban and media culture formation. Furthermore, this paper academically
organizes architectural techniques, computer graphics methodologies, media art
practices, and theoretical backgrounds utilized in null2, highlighting the
scholarly significance of preserving these as an archival document for future
generations.

TL;DR: BloomIntent是一种以用户意图为评估单元的搜索评估方法，通过生成细粒度搜索意图并使用大语言模型自动评估搜索结果，实现了从查询级别到意图级别的评估转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索评估方法难以表示和评估用户意图的多样性，而用户中心化AI评估强调需要将系统与细粒度用户意图对齐。

Method: BloomIntent首先基于用户属性和信息寻求意图类型的分类法生成一组合理的细粒度搜索意图，然后使用大语言模型对每个意图的搜索结果进行自动评估，最后对语义相似的意图进行聚类并在结构化界面中总结评估结果。

Result: 三项技术评估显示，BloomIntent生成的意图具有细粒度、可评估性和现实性，意图级别满意度评估与专家评估者达成72%的一致性。案例研究(N=4)表明该方法能帮助搜索专家识别模糊查询的意图、发现未满足的用户需求。

Conclusion: BloomIntent通过从查询级别转向意图级别评估，重新构想了搜索系统的评估方式，不仅关注性能，更关注其服务多种用户目标的能力。

Abstract: If 100 people issue the same search query, they may have 100 different goals.
While existing work on user-centric AI evaluation highlights the importance of
aligning systems with fine-grained user intents, current search evaluation
methods struggle to represent and assess this diversity. We introduce
BloomIntent, a user-centric search evaluation method that uses user intents as
the evaluation unit. BloomIntent first generates a set of plausible,
fine-grained search intents grounded on taxonomies of user attributes and
information-seeking intent types. Then, BloomIntent provides an automated
evaluation of search results against each intent powered by large language
models. To support practical analysis, BloomIntent clusters semantically
similar intents and summarizes evaluation outcomes in a structured interface.
With three technical evaluations, we showed that BloomIntent generated
fine-grained, evaluable, and realistic intents and produced scalable
assessments of intent-level satisfaction that achieved 72% agreement with
expert evaluators. In a case study (N=4), we showed that BloomIntent supported
search specialists in identifying intents for ambiguous queries, uncovering
underserved user needs, and discovering actionable insights for improving
search experiences. By shifting from query-level to intent-level evaluation,
BloomIntent reimagines how search systems can be assessed -- not only for
performance but for their ability to serve a multitude of user goals.

Method: 通过9个共同设计工作坊让新手训练者和专业教练DIY低保真体上反馈系统，立即试用并在真实训练情境中发现需求和挑战；使用故事板进行速度约会评估设计维度；通过概念验证可穿戴系统原型进一步验证选定维度

Result: 开发出了FlexGuard设计空间，扩展了运动和健身可穿戴设备在力量训练背景下的设计空间

Conclusion: 该研究为力量训练中的智能可穿戴设备提供了实用的体上反馈设计框架，有助于预防训练损伤

Abstract: Strength training carries risk of injury when exercises are performed without
supervision. While haptics research has advanced, there remains a gap in how to
integrate on-body feedback into intelligent wearables. Developing such a design
space requires experiencing feedback in context, yet obtaining functional
systems is costly. By addressing these challenges, we introduce FlexGuard, a
design space for on-body feedback to support injury prevention in strength
training. The design space was derived from nine co-design workshops, where
novice trainees and expert trainers DIY'd low-fidelity on-body feedback
systems, tried them immediately, and surfaced needs and challenges encountered
in real exercising contexts. We then evaluated the space through speed dating,
using storyboards to cover the design dimensions. We followed up with workshops
to further validate selected dimensions in practice through a proof-of-concept
wearable system prototype. Our findings extend the design space for sports and
fitness wearables in the context of strength training.

Motivation: 生成式AI有潜力通过将静态内容转化为动态学习体验来改变教育中的学生参与度，但其在促进学生学习方面的有效性仍有待验证。

Method: 通过Learn Your Way实验研究平台，采用被试间混合方法实验，对60名美国学生进行测试，比较使用动态视听表示和数字阅读器的学习效果。

Result: 使用Learn Your Way的学生比使用数字阅读器的学生有更积极的学习体验和更好的学习成果。

Conclusion: 能够提供多种交互式内容表示的AI驱动工具是增强学生学习的有效且有前景的方法。

Abstract: Generative AI, which is capable of transforming static content into dynamic
learning experiences, holds the potential to revolutionize student engagement
in educational contexts. However, questions still remain around whether or not
these tools are effective at facilitating student learning. In this research,
we test the effectiveness of content transformations through Learn Your Way, an
experimental research platform that transforms textbook chapters into dynamic
visual and audio representations. Through a between-subjects, mixed methods
experiment with 60 US-based students, we demonstrate that students who used
Learn Your Way had a more positive learning experience and had better learning
outcomes compared to students learning the same content via a digital reader.
These findings indicate that AI-driven tools, capable of providing multiple,
interactive representations of content, constitute an effective and promising
method for enhancing student learning.

TL;DR: NaviSense是一个移动辅助系统，结合对话AI、视觉语言模型、AR和LiDAR技术，为视障人士提供开放世界物体检测和实时音频触觉引导，无需预先设置即可通过自然语言指定目标物体并获得空间反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辅助技术存在权衡：提供精确引导的系统需要预扫描或仅支持固定物体类别，而具有开放世界物体识别的系统缺乏空间反馈。NaviSense旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合对话AI、视觉语言模型、AR和LiDAR技术，用户通过自然语言指定物体，系统提供连续空间反馈进行导航。基于形成性研究设计，并与12名视障参与者进行评估。

Result: NaviSense显著减少了物体检索时间，并被参与者优先选择于现有工具。

Conclusion: 将开放世界感知与精确、可访问的引导相结合具有重要价值。

Abstract: People with visual impairments often face significant challenges in locating
and retrieving objects in their surroundings. Existing assistive technologies
present a trade-off: systems that offer precise guidance typically require
pre-scanning or support only fixed object categories, while those with
open-world object recognition lack spatial feedback for reaching the object. To
address this gap, we introduce 'NaviSense', a mobile assistive system that
combines conversational AI, vision-language models, augmented reality (AR), and
LiDAR to support open-world object detection with real-time audio-haptic
guidance. Users specify objects via natural language and receive continuous
spatial feedback to navigate toward the target without needing prior setup.
Designed with insights from a formative study and evaluated with 12 blind and
low-vision participants, NaviSense significantly reduced object retrieval time
and was preferred over existing tools, demonstrating the value of integrating
open-world perception with precise, accessible guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态语音情感识别中，虽然使用ASR获取文本信息可以减少对人工标注的依赖，但ASR错误会降低情感识别性能。需要解决ASR错误对模型性能的负面影响。

Method: 在先前工作的基础上，引入两个新训练策略：1）对抗网络增强模态特定表示的多样性；2）基于标签的对比学习策略更好地捕捉情感特征。提出的方法称为M4SER。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上的大量实验验证了M4SER方法相对于最先进方法的优越性。

Conclusion: M4SER方法通过创新的训练策略有效提升了多模态语音情感识别性能，为减少ASR错误影响提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal speech emotion recognition (SER) has emerged as pivotal for
improving human-machine interaction. Researchers are increasingly leveraging
both speech and textual information obtained through automatic speech
recognition (ASR) to comprehensively recognize emotional states from speakers.
Although this approach reduces reliance on human-annotated text data, ASR
errors possibly degrade emotion recognition performance. To address this
challenge, in our previous work, we introduced two auxiliary tasks, namely, ASR
error detection and ASR error correction, and we proposed a novel multimodal
fusion (MF) method for learning modality-specific and modality-invariant
representations across different modalities. Building on this foundation, in
this paper, we introduce two additional training strategies. First, we propose
an adversarial network to enhance the diversity of modality-specific
representations. Second, we introduce a label-based contrastive learning
strategy to better capture emotional features. We refer to our proposed method
as M4SER and validate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods through
extensive experiments using IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了非洲地区针对自闭症谱系障碍儿童喂养困难的移动健康应用质量，发现仅有2款应用符合标准，质量尚可但数量严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球约1%儿童被诊断患有自闭症谱系障碍，其中46%-89%存在显著喂养困难，移动健康应用可能提供可扩展支持，但其在管理ASD相关喂养挑战方面的质量和相关性尚不明确。

Method: 在2024年9-10月对Apple App Store和Google Play Store进行系统搜索，使用行为改变轮框架评估应用，并通过移动应用评定量表在参与度、功能性、美学和信息质量四个领域进行评分。

Result: 从326个应用中仅筛选出2款iOS应用符合标准，MARS评分分别为3.7和3.9，表明可用性和内容质量可接受至良好。

Conclusion: 针对ASD儿童喂养困难的高质量、循证移动健康应用严重短缺，未来开发应优先考虑临床验证和整合全面的、以照顾者为中心的支持功能。

Abstract: Background: Approximately 1 in 100 children worldwide are diagnosed with
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and 46% to 89% experience significant feeding
difficulties. Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) have emerged as a
potential tool for scalable support. However, their quality and relevance in
managing ASD-related feeding challenges remain unclear.
  Objective: To identify and evaluate the quality of mHealth apps available in
the Africa region addressing feeding difficulties in children with ASD.
  Methods: A systematic search was conducted on the Apple App Store and Google
Play Store between September and October 2024. Applications were included if
they were free, in English, updated within the past year, explicitly focused on
feeding in children with autism, available in the Africa region, and had more
than 100 downloads. Eligible apps were assessed using the Behavior Change Wheel
(BCW) framework and rated with the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) across four
domains: engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality.
  Results: Of the 326 applications identified, only two iOS apps met all
inclusion criteria. EduKitchen-Toddlers Food Games featured child-centered
interactive games and sensory-friendly visuals, while Autism Food Coach 2
provided structured caregiver tools, visual meal plans, and progress tracking.
Both apps aligned with multiple BCW intervention functions, including
education, training, and enablement. MARS scores of 3.7 and 3.9 indicated
acceptable to good usability and content quality.
  Conclusion: There is a critical shortage of high-quality, evidence-based
mHealth applications addressing feeding difficulties in children with ASD.
Future development should prioritize clinical validation and the integration of
comprehensive, caregiver-centered support features to address this gap.

*Baiyu Chen,Benjamin Tag,Hao Xue,Daniel Angus,Flora Salim*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多阶段审计框架，通过分析Facebook广告投放揭示算法偏见，并证明LLM可以从广告流中反推用户敏感属性，揭示了严重的隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体广告投放不透明，存在利用风险且难以外部审查，用户可能被导向有害内容。LLM的出现带来了新的担忧：仅从广告曝光就能反推敏感用户属性。

Method: 采用多阶段审计框架：1) 大规模审计43.5万条澳大利亚Facebook用户的广告印象，分析算法偏见；2) 使用多模态LLM从广告流中重建用户人口统计特征。

Result: 发现算法存在偏见，弱势群体和政治倾向群体被过度投放赌博和政治广告；LLM反推用户属性的表现优于人口普查基线，达到或超过人类水平。

Conclusion: 广告流构成了丰富的数字足迹，可用于公共AI推断，凸显了隐私风险和内容级审计与治理的紧迫需求。

Abstract: Automated ad targeting on social media is opaque, creating risks of
exploitation and invisibility to external scrutiny. Users may be steered toward
harmful content while independent auditing of these processes remains blocked.
Large Language Models (LLMs) raise a new concern: the potential to
reverse-engineer sensitive user attributes from exposure alone. We introduce a
multi-stage auditing framework to investigate these risks. First, a large-scale
audit of over 435,000 ad impressions delivered to 891 Australian Facebook users
reveals algorithmic biases, including disproportionate Gambling and Politics
ads shown to socioeconomically vulnerable and politically aligned groups.
Second, a multimodal LLM can reconstruct users' demographic profiles from ad
streams, outperforming census-based baselines and matching or exceeding human
performance. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that ad streams
constitute rich digital footprints for public AI inference, highlighting urgent
privacy risks and the need for content-level auditing and governance.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文研究了在Meta Quest 3硬件上集成增强型MR合成管道的可行性，使独立VR用户能够进行原生第一人称物理视角MR内容创作，无需外部基础设施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MR内容创作主要依赖外部PC平台和第三方相机，限制了独立VR用户的采用。研究旨在探索在独立VR设备上实现原生MR内容创作的可行性。

Method: 采用基于硬件规格、开发者文档的模拟可行性研究，使用ARM SoC进行基准测试。方法包括通过Meta实验性Passthrough Camera API进行相机直通增强，使用Unity Sentis和FastSAM进行设备端机器学习分割，以及优化的实时合成引擎。

Result: 基准测试显示Quest 3的Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2可支持720p30分辨率的轻量级原生MR合成，资源利用率为95%。与下一代SoC相比，Snapdragon 8 Gen 3有34%的余量，CPU/GPU性能提升1.5-2倍。当前硬件支持基本MR合成，但热限制使运行时间限制在5-10分钟。

Conclusion: 当前硬件支持短时间录制的独立MR内容创作，新一代XR SoC为延长会话时间和提高质量提供了余量。这些发现为将MR内容创作从PC工作流程过渡到一体式VR设备奠定了基础。

Abstract: The adoption of current mixed reality (MR) content creation is primarily
based on external PC-centric platforms and third-party cameras, limiting
adoption for standalone virtual reality (VR) users. In this work, we
investigate the feasibility of integrating an enhanced LIV SDK-like MR
compositing pipeline into the Meta Quest 3 hardware, enabling native
first-person physical perspective (FPP) MR content creation without external
infrastructure. We conducted a simulation-based feasibility study using
hardware specifications, developer documentation, and benchmarking with
ARM-based SoCs, including Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and MediaTek Dimensity 9300. The
approach suggested Camera Passthrough Enhancement using Meta's experimental
Passthrough Camera API with on-device machine learning segmentation through
Unity Sentis and FastSAM, and an optimized real-time compositing engine for
standalone VR. Benchmarking results show that Quest 3's Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2
can support lightweight native MR compositing at 720p30 resolution using 95\%
resource utilization, leaving 5\% thermal headroom for sustained runtime.
Comparison with next-generation SoCs such as Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 demonstrates
34\% headroom, enabling more robust MR experiences with 1.5--2x faster CPU/GPU
performance and higher memory bandwidth. While current Quest 3 hardware
supports basic native MR compositing, thermal limits restrict operation to
5--10 minutes before throttling. Experimental results confirm standalone MR
content creation is possible on current hardware for short recordings, with new
XR SoCs offering the headroom for extended sessions and improved quality. These
findings lay groundwork for transitioning MR content creation from PC-based
workflows to all-in-one VR devices, enhancing MR production for content
creators and researchers.

*Yao Song,Christoph Gebhardt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户偏好的多目标优化方法，通过少量UI元素调整自动确定用户偏好，从而在3D混合现实中生成个性化布局，减少手动调整需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D混合现实界面布局空间无限，需要自动UI适配来提升用户体验。传统多目标优化方法需要用户手动探索帕累托前沿的权衡方案，过程耗时且影响交互流畅性。

Method: 通过少量UI元素调整快速确定用户偏好排名，转换为优先级水平，驱动基于优先级的MOO算法，将搜索聚焦于用户偏好的解决方案。

Result: 用户研究表明，该方法在混合现实环境中显著减少了手动调整次数，相比传统手动设计和帕累托前沿搜索方法，同时保持了高用户满意度。

Conclusion: 这项工作为通过无缝整合用户偏好实现更高效的多目标优化打开了大门。

Abstract: 3D Mixed Reality interfaces have nearly unlimited space for layout placement,
making automatic UI adaptation crucial for enhancing the user experience. Such
adaptation is often formulated as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem,
where multiple, potentially conflicting design objectives must be balanced.
However, selecting a final layout is challenging since MOO typically yields a
set of trade-offs along a Pareto frontier. Prior approaches often required
users to manually explore and evaluate these trade-offs, a time-consuming
process that disrupts the fluidity of interaction. To eliminate this manual and
laborous step, we propose a novel optimization approach that efficiently
determines user preferences from a minimal number of UI element adjustments.
These determined rankings are translated into priority levels, which then drive
our priority-based MOO algorithm. By focusing the search on user-preferred
solutions, our method not only identifies UIs that are more aligned with user
preferences, but also automatically selects the final design from the Pareto
frontier; ultimately, it minimizes user effort while ensuring personalized
layouts. Our user study in a Mixed Reality setting demonstrates that our
preference-guided approach significantly reduces manual adjustments compared to
traditional methods, including fully manual design and exhaustive Pareto front
searches, while maintaining high user satisfaction. We believe this work opens
the door for more efficient MOO by seamlessly incorporating user preferences.

*Anukriti Kumar,Tanushree Padath,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估PDF可访问性的标准化基准数据集和评估框架，并探索了大型语言模型在自动可访问性评估中的能力，最终提出了结合自动化工具、LLM和人工评估的混合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDF作为学术交流的主要格式存在严重的可访问性问题，但目前缺乏标准化的方法来评估不同可访问性评估方法的性能。

Method: 创建了一个包含专家验证可访问性注释的学术PDF基准数据集，开发了四类评估框架，并测试了五种LLM在可访问性评估中的表现。

Result: GPT-4-Turbo在整体准确率上表现最佳（0.85），但所有模型在处理"不存在"和"无法判断"标签时都存在困难。LLM在语义适当性和上下文相关性评估方面优于基于规则的工具。

Conclusion: 提出结合自动化检查器、LLM评估和人工评估的混合方法作为未来PDF可访问性评估的策略。

Abstract: PDFs remain the dominant format for scholarly communication, despite
significant accessibility challenges for blind and low-vision users. While
various tools attempt to evaluate PDF accessibility, there is no standardized
methodology to evaluate how different accessibility assessment approaches
perform. Our work addresses this critical gap by introducing a novel benchmark
dataset of scholarly PDFs with expert-validated accessibility annotations
across seven criteria (alternative text quality, logical reading order,
semantic tagging, table structure, functional hyperlinks, color contrast, and
font readability), and a four-category evaluation framework with standardized
labels (Passed, Failed, Not Present, Cannot Tell) to systematically assess
accessibility evaluation approaches. Using our evaluation framework, we explore
whether large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting automated
accessibility evaluation. We benchmark five LLMs, which demonstrate varying
capabilities in correctly assessing different accessibility criteria, with
GPT-4-Turbo achieving the highest overall accuracy (0.85). However, all models
struggled in correctly categorizing documents with Not Present and Cannot Tell
accessibility labels, particularly for alt text quality assessment. Our
qualitative comparison with standard automated checkers reveals complementary
strengths: rule-based tools excel at technical verification, while LLMs better
evaluate semantic appropriateness and contextual relevance. Based on our
findings, we propose a hybrid approach that would combine automated checkers,
LLM evaluation, and human assessment as a future strategy for PDF accessibility
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身智能体的推理能力会从环境数据中生成敏感结论，这在效用和用户隐私之间造成根本性张力，传统静态控制方法对此无效。

Method: 提出基于情境完整性理论的动态学习框架，使智能体能够通过交互主动学习和适应个体隐私规范。

Result: 提出了一个研究议程，旨在开发既能保持强大能力又能作为用户隐私可信保障的具身智能体。

Conclusion: 将隐私视为动态学习问题，为开发既具备能力又能保护用户隐私的具身智能体提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of embodied agents introduce a critical,
under-explored inferential privacy challenge, where the risk of an agent
generate sensitive conclusions from ambient data. This capability creates a
fundamental tension between an agent's utility and user privacy, rendering
traditional static controls ineffective. To address this, this position paper
proposes a framework that reframes privacy as a dynamic learning problem
grounded in theory of Contextual Integrity (CI). Our approach enables agents to
proactively learn and adapt to individual privacy norms through interaction,
outlining a research agenda to develop embodied agents that are both capable
and function as trustworthy safeguards of user privacy.

Method: 采用范围综述方法，涵盖20年的混合主动视觉分析系统，开发集成分类法整合现有理论框架和新开发的编码。

Result: 分析显示可视化研究文献对混合主动系统的定义缺乏共识，且对人与自动化协作交互的潜力探索有限。

Conclusion: 本研究为推进视觉数据分析中人与AI协作的讨论提供了框架基础。

Abstract: Artificial agents are increasingly integrated into data analysis workflows,
carrying out tasks that were primarily done by humans. Our research explores
how the introduction of automation re-calibrates the dynamic between humans and
automating technology. To explore this question, we conducted a scoping review
encompassing twenty years of mixed-initiative visual analytic systems. To
describe and contrast the relationship between humans and automation, we
developed an integrated taxonomy to delineate the objectives of these
mixed-initiative visual analytics tools, how much automation they support, and
the assumed roles of humans. Here, we describe our qualitative approach of
integrating existing theoretical frameworks with new codes we developed. Our
analysis shows that the visualization research literature lacks consensus on
the definition of mixed-initiative systems and explores a limited potential of
the collaborative interaction landscape between people and automation. Our
research provides a scaffold to advance the discussion of human-AI
collaboration during visual data analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了重质押网络中Sybil攻击的正式框架，分析了两种攻击类型，证明了slash机制设计的局限性，并研究了网络结构对Sybil攻击的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重质押协议扩展了验证者的责任范围，但其安全性依赖于对Sybil攻击的抵抗能力。目前缺乏对重质押网络中Sybil-proofness的正式分析框架。

Method: 引入Sybil-proofness的正式框架，区分两种攻击类型；分析边际和乘法slash机制；证明不可能性定理；通过随机图模型研究网络结构影响。

Result: 证明没有slash机制能同时防止两种攻击类型；Erdős-Rényi网络保持Sybil-proof，但双块随机块模型中即使最小异质性也会使Sybil攻击有利可图。

Conclusion: 重质押机制设计存在根本性限制，网络拓扑结构在Sybil攻击抵抗中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Restaking protocols expand validator responsibilities beyond consensus, but
their security depends on resistance to Sybil attacks. We introduce a formal
framework for Sybil-proofness in restaking networks, distinguishing between two
types of attacks, one in which other Sybil identities are kept out of an attack
and one where multiple Sybil identities attack. We analyze marginal and
multiplicative slashing mechanisms and characterize the conditions under which
each deters Sybil strategies. We then prove an impossibility theorem: no
slashing mechanism can simultaneously prevent both attack types. Finally, we
study the impact of network structure through random graph models: while
Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks remain Sybil-proof, even minimal heterogeneity in a
two-block stochastic block model makes Sybil attacks profitable. These results
reveal fundamental limits of mechanism design for restaking and highlight the
critical role of network topology.

<details>

Motivation: 现有二次融资算法基于个体孤立和自私的模型，存在公平性和效率问题。作者希望通过考虑社会联系和亲社会行为来设计更公平有效的资金分配算法。

Method: 提出连接导向的二次融资(CO-QF)算法，该算法基于多元性和亲社会效用的理论，结合技术和定性方法进行设计。

Result: CO-QF在平台上实现了89%的采用率，已分配超过400万美元资金。模拟显示该算法比QF提供更好的社会福利。

Conclusion: CO-QF不仅适用于特定社区，还可能是通用公共决策的有用工具，展示了基于社会联系的算法设计在提高公平性和效率方面的潜力。

Abstract: We discuss an algorithmic intervention aimed at increasing equity and
economic efficiency at a crowdfunding platform that gives cash subsidies to
grantees. Through a blend of technical and qualitative methods, we show that
the previous algorithm used by the platform -- Quadratic Funding (QF) --
suffered problems because its design was rooted in a model of individuals as
isolated and selfish. We present an alternative algorithm --
Connection-Oriented Quadratic Funding (CO-QF) -- rooted in a theory of
plurality and prosocial utilities, and show that it qualitatively and
quantitatively performs better than QF. CO-QF has achieved an 89% adoption rate
at the platform and has distributed over $4 Million to date. In simulations we
show that it provides better social welfare than QF. While our design for CO-QF
was responsive to the needs of a specific community, we also extrapolate out of
this context to show that CO-QF is a potentially helpful tool for
general-purpose public decision making.

Method: 结合博弈论模型和基于代理的模拟方法，分析代理在竞争环境中战略优化选择的行为，证明稳定群体均衡的存在性，并在不同空间和资源条件下模拟形成动态。

Result: 有限个体资源导致群体主要在邻近行动者间形成，而丰富资源允许群体跨越更大距离；资源异质性和空间邻近性促进更大、更多样化群体的形成。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了影响群体规模和组成的关键权衡，为有效的跨部门合作和多代理系统提供了策略指导。

Abstract: This paper develops a game-theoretic model and an agent-based model to study
group formation driven by resource pooling, spatial cohesion, and
heterogeneity. We focus on cross-sector partnerships (CSPs) involving public,
private, and nonprofit organizations, each contributing distinct resources.
Group formation occurs as agents strategically optimize their choices in
response to others within a competitive setting. We prove the existence of
stable group equilibria and simulate formation dynamics under varying spatial
and resource conditions. The results show that limited individual resources
lead to groups that form mainly among nearby actors, while abundant resources
allow groups to move across larger distances. Increased resource heterogeneity
and spatial proximity promote the formation of larger and more diverse groups.
These findings reveal key trade-offs shaping group size and composition,
guiding strategies for effective cross-sector collaborations and multi-agent
systems.

Motivation: 解决混合物品分配中帕累托最优和嫉妒消除至多一件物品分配方案的存在性问题，这是公平分配领域的一个重要开放问题。

Method: 引入自省性嫉妒消除至多一件物品的概念，即每个代理可以通过在自己的捆绑包中添加或移除一件物品来消除对其他代理的嫉妒。

Result: 建立了混合物品分配中帕累托最优和自省性嫉妒消除至多一件物品分配方案的存在性。

Conclusion: 该结果推广了Mahara关于不可分割杂务的结论，为混合物品的公平分配问题提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The existence of fair and efficient allocations of indivisible items is a
central problem in fair division. For indivisible goods, the existence of
Pareto efficient (PO) and envy free up to one item (EF1) allocations was
established by Caragiannis et al. In a recent breakthrough, Mahara established
the existence of PO and EF1 allocations for indivisible chores.
  However, the existence of PO and EF1 allocations of mixed manna remains an
intriguing open problem. In this paper, we make significant progress in this
direction. We establish the existence of allocations that are PO and
introspective envy free up to one item (IEF1) for mixed manna. In an IEF1
allocation, each agent can eliminate its envy towards all the other agents by
either adding an item or removing an item from its own bundle. The notion of
IEF1 coincides with EF1 for indivisible chores, and hence, our existence result
generalizes the aforementioned result of Mahara.

Motivation: 选举控制是选举攻击中最受研究的形式之一，但以往研究主要集中在决策复杂性分析上，而近似算法研究相对缺乏。本文旨在填补这一空白，解决18年前提出的开放问题。

Method: 利用覆盖整数规划（CIPs）的近似算法，给出了O(log n)因子的近似算法。对于plurality规则，给出了O(m)近似算法，并使用最小k并集（MkU）问题建立了Ω(m^{1/4})的下界。

Result: 对于approval和Condorcet规则下的每个控制问题，证明了所给近似算法是最优的（除非P=NP）。对于plurality规则，给出了O(m)近似算法和Ω(m^{1/4})下界。

Conclusion: 本文首次将MkU问题应用于计算社会选择领域，通过公理化方法将O(m)近似算法推广到无限投票规则族，解决了长期存在的开放问题。

Abstract: Much research in electoral control -- one of the most studied form of
electoral attacks, in which an entity running an election alters the structure
of that election to yield a preferred outcome -- has focused on giving decision
complexity results, e.g., membership in P, NP-completeness, or fixed-parameter
tractability. Approximation algorithms on the other hand have received little
attention in electoral control, despite their prevalence in the study of other
forms of electoral attacks, such as manipulation and bribery. Early work
established some preliminary results with respect to popular voting rules such
as plurality, approval, and Condorcet. In this paper, we establish for each of
the ``standard'' control problems under plurality, approval, and Condorcet,
whether they are approximable, and we prove our results in both the weighted
and unweighted voter settings. For each problem we study under either approval
or Condorcet, we show that any approximation algorithm we give is optimal,
unless P=NP. Our approximation algorithms leverage the fact that Covering
Integer Programs (CIPs) can be approximated within a factor of $O(\log n)$.
Under plurality, we give an $O(m)$-approximation algorithm, and give as lower
bound $\Omega(m^{1/4})$, by using a known lower bound on the Minimum $k$-Union
(M$k$U) problem. To our knowledge, this is the first application of M$k$U in
computational social choice. We also generalize our $O(m)$-approximation
algorithm to work with respect to an infinite family of voting rules using an
axiomatic approach. Our work closes a long list of open problems established 18
years ago.

Motivation: 受生物系统自我识别和形态再生的能力启发，旨在开发一种完全分布式的模块化系统，不依赖全局状态信息。

Method: 使用神经细胞自动机算法，让每个立方体模块独立执行相同的神经网络，仅通过局部通信和传感进行交互。

Result: 系统在数百个模块组成的集合中准确分类多种3D形状，对分布外形状变化、通信故障和模块失效具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作实现了大规模分布式自我识别和损伤检测的物理实现，推进了鲁棒、自适应和生物启发的模块化系统的潜力。

Abstract: Biological systems possess remarkable capabilities for self-recognition and
morphological regeneration, often relying solely on local interactions.
Inspired by these decentralized processes, we present a novel system of
physical 3D bricks--simple cubic units equipped with local communication,
processing, and sensing--that are capable of inferring their global shape class
and detecting structural damage. Leveraging Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), a
learned, fully-distributed algorithm, our system enables each module to
independently execute the same neural network without access to any global
state or positioning information. We demonstrate the ability of collections of
hundreds of these cellular bricks to accurately classify a variety of 3D shapes
through purely local interactions. The approach shows strong robustness to
out-of-distribution shape variations and high tolerance to communication faults
and failed modules. In addition to shape inference, the same decentralized
framework is extended to detect missing or damaged components, allowing the
collective to localize structural disruptions and to guide a recovery process.
This work provides a physical realization of large-scale, decentralized
self-recognition and damage detection, advancing the potential of robust,
adaptive, and bio-inspired modular systems.

### [188] [PEEK: Guiding and Minimal Image Representations for Zero-Shot Generalization of Robot Manipulation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18282)
*Jesse Zhang,Marius Memmel,Kevin Kim,Dieter Fox,Jesse Thomason,Fabio Ramos,Erdem Bıyık,Abhishek Gupta,Anqi Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PEEK提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的中间表示方法，通过预测末端执行器路径和任务相关掩码来提升机器人操作策略的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作策略往往难以泛化，因为它们需要同时学习关注位置、执行动作和执行方式。作者认为高层推理可以交给VLM处理，让策略专注于动作执行。

Method: PEEK微调VLM来预测统一的基于点的中间表示：1）末端执行器路径（指定动作内容），2）任务相关掩码（指定关注位置）。这些注释直接叠加在机器人观察上，使表示与策略无关且可跨架构迁移。

Result: 在真实世界评估中，PEEK显著提升了零样本泛化能力：仅用仿真训练的3D策略在真实世界中提升了41.4倍，大型VLA和小型操作策略分别获得了2-3.5倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过让VLM吸收语义和视觉复杂性，PEEK为操作策略提供了所需的最小线索——关注位置、动作内容和执行方式。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often fail to generalize because they must
simultaneously learn where to attend, what actions to take, and how to execute
them. We argue that high-level reasoning about where and what can be offloaded
to vision-language models (VLMs), leaving policies to specialize in how to act.
We present PEEK (Policy-agnostic Extraction of Essential Keypoints), which
fine-tunes VLMs to predict a unified point-based intermediate representation:
1. end-effector paths specifying what actions to take, and 2. task-relevant
masks indicating where to focus. These annotations are directly overlaid onto
robot observations, making the representation policy-agnostic and transferable
across architectures. To enable scalable training, we introduce an automatic
annotation pipeline, generating labeled data across 20+ robot datasets spanning
9 embodiments. In real-world evaluations, PEEK consistently boosts zero-shot
generalization, including a 41.4x real-world improvement for a 3D policy
trained only in simulation, and 2-3.5x gains for both large VLAs and small
manipulation policies. By letting VLMs absorb semantic and visual complexity,
PEEK equips manipulation policies with the minimal cues they need--where, what,
and how. Website at https://peek-robot.github.io/.

### [189] [Fine-Tuning Robot Policies While Maintaining User Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18311)
*Benjamin A. Christie,Sagar Parekh,Dylan P. Losey*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PRoP是一个保护隐私的机器人个性化框架，通过为每个用户分配唯一密钥来数学变换机器人网络权重，确保只有正确密钥才能访问个性化策略，防止外部代理窃取用户偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人策略需要个性化以满足用户需求，但个性化过程中用户偏好数据容易泄露。需要开发既能个性化又能保护隐私的机器人策略框架。

Method: 为每个用户分配唯一密钥，用该密钥数学变换机器人网络权重。正确密钥可访问个性化策略，错误密钥则恢复基线行为。该方法适用于模仿学习、强化学习和分类任务。

Result: PRoP在多种模型类型中表现良好，保持原始策略架构和行为，实验性能优于现有基于编码器的方法。

Conclusion: PRoP为解决机器人个性化过程中的隐私保护问题提供了有效的模型无关框架，在保护用户数据隐私的同时实现个性化策略。

Abstract: Recent works introduce general-purpose robot policies. These policies provide
a strong prior over how robots should behave -- e.g., how a robot arm should
manipulate food items. But in order for robots to match an individual person's
needs, users typically fine-tune these generalized policies -- e.g., showing
the robot arm how to make their own preferred dinners. Importantly, during the
process of personalizing robots, end-users leak data about their preferences,
habits, and styles (e.g., the foods they prefer to eat). Other agents can
simply roll-out the fine-tuned policy and see these personally-trained
behaviors. This leads to a fundamental challenge: how can we develop robots
that personalize actions while keeping learning private from external agents?
We here explore this emerging topic in human-robot interaction and develop
PRoP, a model-agnostic framework for personalized and private robot policies.
Our core idea is to equip each user with a unique key; this key is then used to
mathematically transform the weights of the robot's network. With the correct
key, the robot's policy switches to match that user's preferences -- but with
incorrect keys, the robot reverts to its baseline behaviors. We show the
general applicability of our method across multiple model types in imitation
learning, reinforcement learning, and classification tasks. PRoP is practically
advantageous because it retains the architecture and behaviors of the original
policy, and experimentally outperforms existing encoder-based approaches. See

*Katherine H. Allen,Chris Rogers,Elaine S. Short*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究比较了人类-人类和人类-机器人协作操纵物体时的运动差异，发现人类协作更流畅，并建议通过改进机器人的触觉通信能力来提升协作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类协作中通过物体运动进行的触觉通信，并将其与人类-机器人协作进行比较，以改进机器人辅助物理任务的能力。

Method: 使用低成本IMU跟踪人类-人类和人类-机器人协作时的物体运动，并通过问卷收集参与者反馈。

Result: 人类-人类协作比人类-机器人协作更流畅，IMU数据能捕捉到运动特征的客观差异。

Conclusion: 人类-人类和人类-机器人协作在准确性和流畅性上的差异表明，需要改进机器人发送和接收拟人化触觉信号的能力。

Abstract: When a human dyad jointly manipulates an object, they must communicate about
their intended motion plans. Some of that collaboration is achieved through the
motion of the manipulated object itself, which we call "haptic communication."
In this work, we captured the motion of human-human dyads moving an object
together with one participant leading a motion plan about which the follower is
uninformed. We then captured the same human participants manipulating the same
object with a robot collaborator. By tracking the motion of the shared object
using a low-cost IMU, we can directly compare human-human shared manipulation
to the motion of those same participants interacting with the robot.
Intra-study and post-study questionnaires provided participant feedback on the
collaborations, indicating that the human-human collaborations are
significantly more fluent, and analysis of the IMU data indicates that it
captures objective differences in the motion profiles of the conditions. The
differences in objective and subjective measures of accuracy and fluency
between the human-human and human-robot trials motivate future research into
improving robot assistants for physical tasks by enabling them to send and
receive anthropomorphic haptic signals.

### [191] [Application Management in C-ITS: Orchestrating Demand-Driven Deployments and Reconfigurations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18793)
*Lukas Zanger,Bastian Lampe,Lennart Reiher,Lutz Eckstein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Kubernetes的需求驱动应用管理方法，用于解决大规模协同智能交通系统中动态环境下的应用编排挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着车辆自动化和互联程度的提高，协同智能交通系统需要高效的云原生技术来管理动态环境中的应用，但现有方法在资源利用效率方面存在不足。

Method: 开发了一个基于Kubernetes和ROS 2的应用管理框架，通过需求驱动的自动化流程（部署、重配置、更新、升级和扩展）来动态协调不同实体的需求。

Result: 该方法能够减少计算资源消耗和网络流量，并在集体环境感知用例中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的需求驱动应用管理方法为大规模C-ITS提供了可行的云原生解决方案，源代码已公开供社区使用。

Abstract: Vehicles are becoming increasingly automated and interconnected, enabling the
formation of cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) and the use of
offboard services. As a result, cloud-native techniques, such as microservices
and container orchestration, play an increasingly important role in their
operation. However, orchestrating applications in a large-scale C-ITS poses
unique challenges due to the dynamic nature of the environment and the need for
efficient resource utilization. In this paper, we present a demand-driven
application management approach that leverages cloud-native techniques -
specifically Kubernetes - to address these challenges. Taking into account the
demands originating from different entities within the C-ITS, the approach
enables the automation of processes, such as deployment, reconfiguration,
update, upgrade, and scaling of microservices. Executing these processes on
demand can, for example, reduce computing resource consumption and network
traffic. A demand may include a request for provisioning an external supporting
service, such as a collective environment model. The approach handles changing
and new demands by dynamically reconciling them through our proposed
application management framework built on Kubernetes and the Robot Operating
System (ROS 2). We demonstrate the operation of our framework in the C-ITS use
case of collective environment perception and make the source code of the
prototypical framework publicly available at

### [193] [Proactive-reactive detection and mitigation of intermittent faults in robot swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19246)
*Sinan Oğuz,Emanuele Garone,Marco Dorigo,Mary Katherine Heinrich*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对机器人群体中间歇性故障的主动-反应式检测与缓解策略，利用自组织备份层和多路网络中的分布式共识来解决间歇性故障问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间歇性故障是短暂出现和消失的瞬态错误，对可靠性和协调性构成重大挑战。现有机器人群体容错研究主要关注永久性故障，而间歇性故障在完全自组织的ad-hoc网络中极难检测，因为网络拓扑是瞬态且不可预测的。

Method: 采用主动-反应式策略：主动方面，机器人在故障发生前自组织动态备份路径；反应方面，使用一次性似然比检验比较多路网络中不同路径的信息，实现早期故障检测。检测到故障后，通信以自组织方式临时重路由。

Result: 在形成控制中故障位置数据的代表性场景中验证了该方法，证明间歇性故障被有效阻止破坏期望形成的收敛，具有高故障检测精度和低误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法首次在具有持久网络的机器人群体中有效解决了间歇性故障问题，通过自组织备份层和分布式共识实现了可靠的故障检测和缓解。

Abstract: Intermittent faults are transient errors that sporadically appear and
disappear. Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to
reliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot
swarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that
intermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully
self-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network
topologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently
introduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are
able to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing
the problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in
robot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel
proactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on
self-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.
Proactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,
adapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative
positions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare
information received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling
early fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in
a self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves. We validate the
approach in representative scenarios of faulty positional data occurring during
formation control, demonstrating that intermittent faults are prevented from
disrupting convergence to desired formations, with high fault detection
accuracy and low rates of false positives.

*Rajitha de Silva,Jonathan Cox,James R. Heselden,Marija Popovic,Cesar Cadena,Riccardo Polvara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于葡萄园环境定位的语义粒子滤波器，通过融合语义地标（葡萄树干和支撑杆）和LiDAR数据，解决了重复行几何结构导致的感知混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在结构化户外环境（如葡萄园）中，由于重复的行几何结构和感知混淆，传统的LiDAR定位方法经常失效，需要更稳定的语义信息来改善定位精度。

Method: 使用语义粒子滤波器，将检测到的语义地标（树干和支撑杆）投影到鸟瞰图并与LiDAR扫描融合生成语义观测。创新性地使用语义墙连接相邻地标形成伪结构约束，并在语义稀疏的头地区域引入自适应GPS先验。

Result: 在真实葡萄园实验中，该方法能够在正确的行内保持定位，从AMCL失败的偏差中恢复，并优于基于视觉的SLAM方法如RTAB-Map。

Conclusion: 语义粒子滤波器通过结合语义地标和结构约束，有效解决了葡萄园环境中的定位挑战，为结构化户外环境提供了鲁棒的定位解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate localisation is critical for mobile robots in structured outdoor
environments, yet LiDAR-based methods often fail in vineyards due to repetitive
row geometry and perceptual aliasing. We propose a semantic particle filter
that incorporates stable object-level detections, specifically vine trunks and
support poles into the likelihood estimation process. Detected landmarks are
projected into a birds eye view and fused with LiDAR scans to generate semantic
observations. A key innovation is the use of semantic walls, which connect
adjacent landmarks into pseudo-structural constraints that mitigate row
aliasing. To maintain global consistency in headland regions where semantics
are sparse, we introduce a noisy GPS prior that adaptively supports the filter.
Experiments in a real vineyard demonstrate that our approach maintains
localisation within the correct row, recovers from deviations where AMCL fails,
and outperforms vision-based SLAM methods such as RTAB-Map.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAD-VF是一种无需微调的框架，利用形式化验证反馈进行自动提示工程，通过文本损失函数迭代优化提示而非模型参数，显著提升LLM驱动规划系统的规范合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的规划系统在物理世界部署时经常违反安全和监管约束，传统对齐方法需要昂贵的人工标注或资源密集的微调，需要一种更高效可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出LAD-VF框架，结合形式化验证反馈的文本损失函数与LLM-AutoDiff，通过迭代提示工程而非模型参数微调来实现对齐。

Result: 在机器人导航和操作任务中，LAD-VF将规范合规成功率从60%提升至90%以上。

Conclusion: LAD-VF为可信赖、形式化验证的LLM驱动控制系统提供了一条可扩展且可解释的路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can translate natural language instructions into
executable action plans for robotics, autonomous driving, and other domains.
Yet, deploying LLM-driven planning in the physical world demands strict
adherence to safety and regulatory constraints, which current models often
violate due to hallucination or weak alignment. Traditional data-driven
alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), require costly
human labeling, while recent formal-feedback approaches still depend on
resource-intensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose LAD-VF, a
fine-tuning-free framework that leverages formal verification feedback for
automated prompt engineering. By introducing a formal-verification-informed
text loss integrated with LLM-AutoDiff, LAD-VF iteratively refines prompts
rather than model parameters. This yields three key benefits: (i) scalable
adaptation without fine-tuning; (ii) compatibility with modular LLM
architectures; and (iii) interpretable refinement via auditable prompts.
Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate that LAD-VF
substantially enhances specification compliance, improving success rates from
60% to over 90%. Our method thus presents a scalable and interpretable pathway
toward trustworthy, formally-verified LLM-driven control systems.

*Navya Tiwari,Joseph Vazhaeparampil,Victoria Preston*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于无控制交叉口路权推理的驾驶员辅助框架，采用部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）建模，通过概率规划器显著提高了碰撞避免率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无控制交叉口由于路权规则模糊、视线遮挡和驾驶员行为不可预测等原因导致大量交通事故，而现有研究主要关注自动驾驶车辆，缺乏针对人工驾驶车辆的辅助导航系统。

Method: 构建了POMDP框架，在定制仿真测试平台上评估了四种决策方法：确定性有限状态机（FSM）和三种概率规划器（QMDP、POMCP、DESPOT），测试场景包括随机交通参与者、行人、遮挡和对抗性情境。

Result: 概率规划器显著优于基于规则的基线方法，在部分可观测条件下实现了高达97.5%的无碰撞导航率，其中POMCP优先考虑安全性，DESPOT在效率和运行时间可行性之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 研究强调了不确定性感知规划对驾驶员辅助的重要性，为未来集成传感器融合和环境感知模块以实现真实交通环境中的实时部署提供了动力。

Abstract: Uncontrolled intersections account for a significant fraction of roadway
crashes due to ambiguous right-of-way rules, occlusions, and unpredictable
driver behavior. While autonomous vehicle research has explored
uncertainty-aware decision making, few systems exist to retrofit human-operated
vehicles with assistive navigation support. We present a driver-assist
framework for right-of-way reasoning at uncontrolled intersections, formulated
as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Using a custom
simulation testbed with stochastic traffic agents, pedestrians, occlusions, and
adversarial scenarios, we evaluate four decision-making approaches: a
deterministic finite state machine (FSM), and three probabilistic planners:
QMDP, POMCP, and DESPOT. Results show that probabilistic planners outperform
the rule-based baseline, achieving up to 97.5 percent collision-free navigation
under partial observability, with POMCP prioritizing safety and DESPOT
balancing efficiency and runtime feasibility. Our findings highlight the
importance of uncertainty-aware planning for driver assistance and motivate
future integration of sensor fusion and environment perception modules for
real-time deployment in realistic traffic environments.

TL;DR: LAWM是一个模型无关的框架，通过世界建模从无标签视频数据中学习潜在动作表示，用于自监督预训练模仿学习模型，在保持高效性的同时实现了跨任务、环境和体现的迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型依赖于大规模人工标注的动作数据集，模型尺寸庞大，难以在实际场景中部署。需要一种更高效、实用的预训练方法。

Method: 提出LAWM框架，通过世界建模从无标签视频（机器人记录或人类日常动作视频）中学习潜在动作表示，实现自监督预训练。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实世界设置中，LAWM优于使用真实机器人动作训练的模型和类似预训练方法，同时显著更高效实用。

Conclusion: LAWM提供了一种高效的自监督预训练框架，能够有效学习潜在动作表示，为实际机器人部署提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have gained popularity for learning
robotic manipulation tasks that follow language instructions. State-of-the-art
VLAs, such as OpenVLA and $\pi_{0}$, were trained on large-scale, manually
labeled action datasets collected through teleoperation. More recent
approaches, including LAPA and villa-X, introduce latent action representations
that enable unsupervised pretraining on unlabeled datasets by modeling abstract
visual changes between frames. Although these methods have shown strong
results, their large model sizes make deployment in real-world settings
challenging. In this work, we propose LAWM, a model-agnostic framework to
pretrain imitation learning models in a self-supervised way, by learning latent
action representations from unlabeled video data through world modeling. These
videos can be sourced from robot recordings or videos of humans performing
actions with everyday objects. Our framework is designed to be effective for
transferring across tasks, environments, and embodiments. It outperforms models
trained with ground-truth robotics actions and similar pretraining methods on
the LIBERO benchmark and real-world setup, while being significantly more
efficient and practical for real-world settings.

TL;DR: PrioriTouch是一个用于在物理人机交互中处理多接触点优先级控制的框架，通过学习和排序控制目标来适应个体接触偏好，特别适用于护理场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理人机交互中需要机器人适应个体的接触偏好，但在多接触点交互时，不同身体部位可能产生冲突的力要求，特别是在护理任务中这种冲突不可避免，需要优先级排序。

Method: 结合学习排序方法和分层操作空间控制，利用仿真循环进行数据高效且安全的探索，从用户研究中获取个性化舒适阈值并整合到框架中。

Result: 通过广泛的仿真和真实世界实验验证，PrioriTouch能够适应用户接触偏好，保持任务性能，并提高安全性和舒适度。

Conclusion: PrioriTouch框架为多接触点物理人机交互提供了一种有效的优先级控制方法，特别适用于护理等需要处理冲突接触偏好的场景。

Abstract: Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) requires robots to adapt to
individual contact preferences, such as where and how much force is applied.
Identifying preferences is difficult for a single contact; with whole-arm
interaction involving multiple simultaneous contacts between the robot and
human, the challenge is greater because different body parts can impose
incompatible force requirements. In caregiving tasks, where contact is frequent
and varied, such conflicts are unavoidable. With multiple preferences across
multiple contacts, no single solution can satisfy all objectives--trade-offs
are inherent, making prioritization essential. We present PrioriTouch, a
framework for ranking and executing control objectives across multiple
contacts. PrioriTouch can prioritize from a general collection of controllers,
making it applicable not only to caregiving scenarios such as bed bathing and
dressing but also to broader multi-contact settings. Our method combines a
novel learning-to-rank approach with hierarchical operational space control,
leveraging simulation-in-the-loop rollouts for data-efficient and safe
exploration. We conduct a user study on physical assistance preferences, derive
personalized comfort thresholds, and incorporate them into PrioriTouch. We
evaluate PrioriTouch through extensive simulation and real-world experiments,
demonstrating its ability to adapt to user contact preferences, maintain task
performance, and enhance safety and comfort. Website:

Conclusion: GD2P方法有效解决了多指灵巧手非抓取操作的挑战，提供了可扩展的训练框架，并开源了包含130万手部姿态和2300个物体的数据集，促进了相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Nonprehensile manipulation, such as pushing and pulling, enables robots to
move, align, or reposition objects that may be difficult to grasp due to their
geometry, size, or relationship to the robot or the environment. Much of the
existing work in nonprehensile manipulation relies on parallel-jaw grippers or
tools such as rods and spatulas. In contrast, multi-fingered dexterous hands
offer richer contact modes and versatility for handling diverse objects to
provide stable support over the objects, which compensates for the difficulty
of modeling the dynamics of nonprehensile manipulation. Therefore, we propose
Geometry-aware Dexterous Pushing and Pulling (GD2P) for nonprehensile
manipulation with dexterous robotic hands. We study pushing and pulling by
framing the problem as synthesizing and learning pre-contact dexterous hand
poses that lead to effective manipulation. We generate diverse hand poses via
contact-guided sampling, filter them using physics simulation, and train a
diffusion model conditioned on object geometry to predict viable poses. At test
time, we sample hand poses and use standard motion planners to select and
execute pushing and pulling actions. We perform 840 real-world experiments with
an Allegro Hand, comparing our method to baselines. The results indicate that
GD2P offers a scalable route for training dexterous nonprehensile manipulation
policies. We further demonstrate GD2P on a LEAP Hand, highlighting its
applicability to different hand morphologies. Our pre-trained models and
dataset, including 1.3 million hand poses across 2.3k objects, will be
open-source to facilitate further research. Our project website is available

Conclusion: 基于反事实推理的框架为感知系统故障检测提供了新的解决方案，特别是在资源受限的自主系统中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Perception systems provide a rich understanding of the environment for
autonomous systems, shaping decisions in all downstream modules. Hence,
accurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important.
Faults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied
to the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage
pipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a
counterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection
and isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical
redundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical
redundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability
tests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios.
Counterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized
faults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and
active FDI methods. While the passive FDI can be achieved by belief updates,
the active FDI approach is defined as a causal bandit problem, where we utilize
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bound (UCB) to find
control inputs that maximize a detection and isolation metric, designated as
Effective Information (EI). The mentioned metric quantifies the informativeness
of control inputs for FDI. We demonstrate the approach in a robot exploration
scenario, where a space robot performing vision-based navigation actively
adjusts its attitude to increase EI and correctly isolate faults caused by
sensor damage, dynamic scenes, and perceptual degradation.

Abstract: This paper explores how deliberate mutations of reward function in
reinforcement learning can produce diversified skill variations in robotic
manipulation tasks, examined with a liquid pouring use case. To this end, we
developed a new reward function mutation framework that is based on applying
Gaussian noise to the weights of the different terms in the reward function.
Inspired by the cost-benefit tradeoff model from human motor control, we
designed the reward function with the following key terms: accuracy, time, and
effort. The study was performed in a simulation environment created in NVIDIA
Isaac Sim, and the setup included Franka Emika Panda robotic arm holding a
glass with a liquid that needed to be poured into a container. The
reinforcement learning algorithm was based on Proximal Policy Optimization. We
systematically explored how different configurations of mutated weights in the
rewards function would affect the learned policy. The resulting policies
exhibit a wide range of behaviours: from variations in execution of the
originally intended pouring task to novel skills useful for unexpected tasks,
such as container rim cleaning, liquid mixing, and watering. This approach
offers promising directions for robotic systems to perform diversified learning
of specific tasks, while also potentially deriving meaningful skills for future
tasks.

*Junnosuke Kamohara,Feiyang Wu,Chinmayee Wamorkar,Seth Hutchinson,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合模型预测控制（MPC）和强化学习（RL）的框架，专门用于双足机器人在粗糙和湿滑地形上的运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC在平坦地形上表现良好但难以建模复杂地形交互，RL在多样地形上训练稳健策略但缺乏约束保证且需要大量奖励设计。现有MPC-RL组合方法主要局限于平坦地形或四足机器人。

Method: 基于单刚体动力学的MPC框架，参数化三个关键组件：系统动力学、摆动腿控制器和步态频率，通过RL进行增强优化。

Result: 在NVIDIA IsaacLab中的双足机器人仿真实验表明，该方法在楼梯、踏脚石和低摩擦表面等多种地形上，比基线MPC和RL产生更自适应和稳健的行为。

Conclusion: RL增强的MPC框架成功结合了MPC的约束保证和RL的地形适应性优势，为双足机器人在挑战性环境中的运动控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated effectiveness for humanoid
bipedal locomotion; however, its applicability in challenging environments,
such as rough and slippery terrain, is limited by the difficulty of modeling
terrain interactions. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved
notable success in training robust locomotion policies over diverse terrain,
yet it lacks guarantees of constraint satisfaction and often requires
substantial reward shaping. Recent efforts in combining MPC and RL have shown
promise of taking the best of both worlds, but they are primarily restricted to
flat terrain or quadrupedal robots. In this work, we propose an RL-augmented
MPC framework tailored for bipedal locomotion over rough and slippery terrain.
Our method parametrizes three key components of
single-rigid-body-dynamics-based MPC: system dynamics, swing leg controller,
and gait frequency. We validate our approach through bipedal robot simulations
in NVIDIA IsaacLab across various terrains, including stairs, stepping stones,
and low-friction surfaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
RL-augmented MPC framework produces significantly more adaptive and robust
behaviors compared to baseline MPC and RL.

Conclusion: 该框架具有可扩展性和广泛适用性，能够应对多样化的自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel envelope based model predictive control (MPC)
framework designed to enable autonomous vehicles to handle high performance
driving across a wide range of scenarios without a predefined reference. In
high performance autonomous driving, safe operation at the vehicle's dynamic
limits requires a real time planning and control framework capable of
accounting for key vehicle dynamics and environmental constraints when
following a predefined reference trajectory is suboptimal or even infeasible.
State of the art planning and control frameworks, however, are predominantly
reference based, which limits their performance in such situations. To address
this gap, this work first introduces a computationally efficient vehicle
dynamics model tailored for optimization based control and a continuously
differentiable mathematical formulation that accurately captures the entire
drivable envelope. This novel model and formulation allow for the direct
integration of dynamic feasibility and safety constraints into a unified
planning and control framework, thereby removing the necessity for predefined
references. The challenge of envelope planning, which refers to maximally
approximating the safe drivable area, is tackled by combining reinforcement
learning with optimization techniques. The framework is validated through both
simulations and real world experiments, demonstrating its high performance
across a variety of tasks, including racing, emergency collision avoidance and
off road navigation. These results highlight the framework's scalability and
broad applicability across a diverse set of scenarios.

Conclusion: LCMF框架为资源受限场景下的人机交互应用提供了具有强大多模态决策泛化能力的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic learning plays a critical role in embodied intelligence,
especially when robots perceive their surroundings, understand human
instructions, and make intelligent decisions. However, the field faces
technical challenges such as effective fusion of heterogeneous data and
computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To address these
challenges, this study proposes the lightweight LCMF cascaded attention
framework, introducing a multi-level cross-modal parameter sharing mechanism
into the Mamba module. By integrating the advantages of Cross-Attention and
Selective parameter-sharing State Space Models (SSMs), the framework achieves
efficient fusion of heterogeneous modalities and semantic complementary
alignment. Experimental results show that LCMF surpasses existing multimodal
baselines with an accuracy of 74.29% in VQA tasks and achieves competitive
mid-tier performance within the distribution cluster of Large Language Model
Agents (LLM Agents) in EQA video tasks. Its lightweight design achieves a
4.35-fold reduction in FLOPs relative to the average of comparable baselines
while using only 166.51M parameters (image-text) and 219M parameters
(video-text), providing an efficient solution for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
applications in resource-constrained scenarios with strong multimodal decision
generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖穷举探索或僵化的导航策略，泛化能力差，无法在未见环境中实现快速适应和可扩展的自主导航。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：探索阶段使用结构化提示引导VLM搜索构建紧凑场景图；部署阶段使用神经符号规划器在场景图上推理生成可执行计划，并利用缓存机制加速适应。

Result: VLN-Zero在零样本模型中成功率提高2倍，超越大多数微调基线，到达目标位置时间减半，VLM调用减少55%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过快速探索、符号推理和缓存执行，克服了现有视觉语言导航方法的计算效率低和泛化能力差的问题，实现了在未见环境中鲁棒且可扩展的决策。

Abstract: Rapid adaptation in unseen environments is essential for scalable real-world
autonomy, yet existing approaches rely on exhaustive exploration or rigid
navigation policies that fail to generalize. We present VLN-Zero, a two-phase
vision-language navigation framework that leverages vision-language models to
efficiently construct symbolic scene graphs and enable zero-shot neurosymbolic
navigation. In the exploration phase, structured prompts guide VLM-based search
toward informative and diverse trajectories, yielding compact scene graph
representations. In the deployment phase, a neurosymbolic planner reasons over
the scene graph and environmental observations to generate executable plans,
while a cache-enabled execution module accelerates adaptation by reusing
previously computed task-location trajectories. By combining rapid exploration,
symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution, the proposed framework
overcomes the computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior
vision-language navigation methods, enabling robust and scalable
decision-making in unseen environments. VLN-Zero achieves 2x higher success
rate compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned
baselines, and reaches goal locations in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls
on average compared to state-of-the-art models across diverse environments.

Conclusion: 该人机协作框架有效解决了LLM在机器人领域的长时程任务规划问题，通过技能复用机制显著提升了任务成功率和效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based code generation for robotic manipulation
has recently shown promise by directly translating human instructions into
executable code, but existing methods remain noisy, constrained by fixed
primitives and limited context windows, and struggle with long-horizon tasks.
While closed-loop feedback has been explored, corrected knowledge is often
stored in improper formats, restricting generalization and causing catastrophic
forgetting, which highlights the need for learning reusable skills. Moreover,
approaches that rely solely on LLM guidance frequently fail in extremely
long-horizon scenarios due to LLMs' limited reasoning capability in the robotic
domain, where such issues are often straightforward for humans to identify. To
address these challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that encodes
corrections into reusable skills, supported by external memory and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a hint mechanism for dynamic reuse.
Experiments on Ravens, Franka Kitchen, and MetaWorld, as well as real-world
settings, show that our framework achieves a 0.93 success rate (up to 27%
higher than baselines) and a 42% efficiency improvement in correction rounds.
It can robustly solve extremely long-horizon tasks such as "build a house",
which requires planning over 20 primitives.

Abstract: End-to-end motion planning is promising for simplifying complex autonomous

effective prediction for decision-making continue to present substantial
obstacles to its large-scale deployment. In this paper, we present PIE, a
pioneering framework that integrates advanced perception, reasoning, and

addresses data compression losses in multimodal fusion of camera and LiDAR
inputs, alongside a novel reasoning-enhanced decoder integrating Mamba and
Mixture-of-Experts to facilitate scene-compliant anchor selection and optimize
adaptive trajectory inference. PIE adopts an action-motion interaction module
to effectively utilize state predictions of surrounding agents to refine ego

benchmark. PIE, without using any ensemble and data augmentation techniques,
achieves an 88.9 PDM score and 85.6 EPDM score, surpassing the performance of

Conclusion: SINGER系统成功实现了仅使用机载传感和计算的语言引导自主无人机导航，展示了强大的开放词汇导航能力和零样本迁移性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have driven remarkable progress in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., generalist robot manipulation policies,
that enable robots to complete complex tasks specified in natural language.
Despite these successes, open-vocabulary autonomous drone navigation remains an
unsolved challenge due to the scarcity of large-scale demonstrations, real-time
control demands of drones for stabilization, and lack of reliable external pose
estimation modules. In this work, we present SINGER for language-guided
autonomous drone navigation in the open world using only onboard sensing and
compute. To train robust, open-vocabulary navigation policies, SINGER leverages
three central components: (i) a photorealistic language-embedded flight
simulator with minimal sim-to-real gap using Gaussian Splatting for efficient
data generation, (ii) an RRT-inspired multi-trajectory generation expert for
collision-free navigation demonstrations, and these are used to train (iii) a
lightweight end-to-end visuomotor policy for real-time closed-loop control.
Through extensive hardware flight experiments, we demonstrate superior
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of our policy to unseen environments and unseen
language-conditioned goal objects. When trained on ~700k-1M observation action
pairs of language conditioned visuomotor data and deployed on hardware, SINGER
outperforms a velocity-controlled semantic guidance baseline by reaching the
query 23.33% more on average, and maintains the query in the field of view
16.67% more on average, with 10% fewer collisions.

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的自动驾驶系统主要在无事故数据上训练，缺乏安全边界附近的指导。真实事故报告包含所需的对比证据，但难以直接使用。

Method: 将事故叙述标准化为自我中心语言，将日志和事故转换为统一的场景-动作表示。在决策时检索相关先例，并通过智能反事实扩展提出替代方案进行推理。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，先例检索显著改善了校准效果，上下文偏好动作的召回率从24%提升到53%。反事实变体在保持这些收益的同时，在风险附近做出更精确的决策。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用事故报告信息来改善自动驾驶系统在安全边界附近的决策性能，通过检索和反事实推理提高了系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems are trained mostly on incident-free
data, offering little guidance near safety-performance boundaries. Real crash
reports contain precisely the contrastive evidence needed, but they are hard to
use: narratives are unstructured, third-person, and poorly grounded to sensor
views. We address these challenges by normalizing crash narratives to
ego-centric language and converting both logs and crashes into a unified
scene-action representation suitable for retrieval. At decision time, our
system adjudicates proposed actions by retrieving relevant precedents from this
unified index; an agentic counterfactual extension proposes plausible
alternatives, retrieves for each, and reasons across outcomes before deciding.
On a nuScenes benchmark, precedent retrieval substantially improves
calibration, with recall on contextually preferred actions rising from 24% to
53%. The counterfactual variant preserves these gains while sharpening
decisions near risk.

Abstract: Behavior cloning has shown promise for robot manipulation, but real-world
demonstrations are costly to acquire at scale. While simulated data offers a
scalable alternative, particularly with advances in automated demonstration
generation, transferring policies to the real world is hampered by various
simulation and real domain gaps. In this work, we propose a unified
sim-and-real co-training framework for learning generalizable manipulation
policies that primarily leverages simulation and only requires a few real-world
demonstrations. Central to our approach is learning a domain-invariant,
task-relevant feature space. Our key insight is that aligning the joint
distributions of observations and their corresponding actions across domains
provides a richer signal than aligning observations (marginals) alone. We
achieve this by embedding an Optimal Transport (OT)-inspired loss within the
co-training framework, and extend this to an Unbalanced OT framework to handle
the imbalance between abundant simulation data and limited real-world examples.
We validate our method on challenging manipulation tasks, showing it can
leverage abundant simulation data to achieve up to a 30% improvement in the
real-world success rate and even generalize to scenarios seen only in
simulation.

Abstract: Formation maintenance with varying number of drones in narrow environments
hinders the convergence of planning to the desired configurations. To address
this challenge, this paper proposes a formation planning method guided by
Deformable Virtual Structures (DVS) with continuous spatiotemporal
transformation. Firstly, to satisfy swarm safety distance and preserve
formation shape filling integrity for irregular formation geometries, we employ
Lloyd algorithm for uniform $\underline{PA}$rtitioning and Hungarian algorithm
for $\underline{AS}$signment (PAAS) in DVS. Subsequently, a spatiotemporal
trajectory involving DVS is planned using primitive-based path search and
nonlinear trajectory optimization. The DVS trajectory achieves adaptive
transitions with respect to a varying number of drones while ensuring
adaptability to narrow environments through affine transformation. Finally,
each agent conducts distributed trajectory planning guided by desired
spatiotemporal positions within the DVS, while incorporating collision
avoidance and dynamic feasibility requirements. Our method enables up to 15\%
of swarm numbers to join or leave in cluttered environments while rapidly
restoring the desired formation shape in simulation. Compared to cutting-edge
formation planning method, we demonstrate rapid formation recovery capacity and
environmental adaptability. Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness
and resilience of our formation planning method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于模仿学习的视觉运动策略通常同时使用视觉观察和本体感知状态来实现精确控制，但这种方法导致策略过度依赖本体感知状态输入，容易过拟合训练轨迹，导致空间泛化能力差。

Method: 构建相对末端执行器动作空间中的无状态策略，仅基于视觉观察预测动作，使用双广角腕部摄像头提供完整的任务相关视觉观察。

Result: 无状态策略在空间泛化方面显著优于基于状态的策略：在真实世界任务中，高度泛化的平均成功率从0%提升到85%，水平泛化从6%提升到64%。

Conclusion: 无状态策略不仅提高了空间泛化能力，还在数据效率和跨机器人适应方面表现出优势，增强了在实际部署中的实用性。

Abstract: Imitation-learning-based visuomotor policies have been widely used in robot
manipulation, where both visual observations and proprioceptive states are
typically adopted together for precise control. However, in this study, we find
that this common practice makes the policy overly reliant on the proprioceptive
state input, which causes overfitting to the training trajectories and results
in poor spatial generalization. On the contrary, we propose the State-free
Policy, removing the proprioceptive state input and predicting actions only
conditioned on visual observations. The State-free Policy is built in the
relative end-effector action space, and should ensure the full task-relevant
visual observations, here provided by dual wide-angle wrist cameras. Empirical
results demonstrate that the State-free policy achieves significantly stronger
spatial generalization than the state-based policy: in real-world tasks such as
pick-and-place, challenging shirt-folding, and complex whole-body manipulation,
spanning multiple robot embodiments, the average success rate improves from 0\%
to 85\% in height generalization and from 6\% to 64\% in horizontal
generalization. Furthermore, they also show advantages in data efficiency and
cross-embodiment adaptation, enhancing their practicality for real-world
deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合上下文信息和分布鲁棒性，显著提高了碰撞避免的可靠性，适用于复杂动态环境下的运动规划。

Abstract: We present a distributionally robust approach for collision avoidance by
incorporating contextual information. Specifically, we embed the conditional
distribution of future trajectory of the obstacle conditioned on the motion of
the ego agent in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via the conditional
kernel mean embedding operator. Then, we define an ambiguity set containing all
distributions whose embedding in the RKHS is within a certain distance from the
empirical estimate of conditional mean embedding learnt from past data.
Consequently, a distributionally robust collision avoidance constraint is
formulated, and included in the receding horizon based motion planning
formulation of the ego agent. Simulation results show that the proposed
approach is more successful in avoiding collision compared to approaches that
do not include contextual information and/or distributional robustness in their

TL;DR: SPiDR是一种通过悲观域随机化实现安全模拟到现实迁移的可扩展算法，能够在保持性能的同时有效处理模拟到现实的差距带来的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在现实世界部署中的安全性是主要关注点，模拟器提供安全可扩展的训练环境，但模拟到现实的差距会引入额外的安全风险。现有方法要么不兼容标准训练流程，要么在实践中会导致不安全行为。

Method: SPiDR使用域随机化技术，将模拟到现实差距的不确定性纳入安全约束中，通过悲观域随机化来确保安全。

Result: 在模拟到模拟基准测试和两个不同的真实机器人平台上进行广泛实验，证明SPiDR能够有效确保安全，同时保持强大的性能。

Conclusion: SPiDR是一种具有可证明保证的安全模拟到现实迁移算法，具有高度兼容性和实用性。

Abstract: Safety remains a major concern for deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in
real-world applications. Simulators provide safe, scalable training
environments, but the inevitable sim-to-real gap introduces additional safety
concerns, as policies must satisfy constraints in real-world conditions that
differ from simulation. To address this challenge, robust safe RL techniques
offer principled methods, but are often incompatible with standard scalable
training pipelines. In contrast, domain randomization, a simple and popular
sim-to-real technique, stands out as a promising alternative, although it often
results in unsafe behaviors in practice. We present SPiDR, short for
Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with
provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain
randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the
safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing
training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and
two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR
effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong
performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 3D Flow Diffusion Policy (3D FDP) 是一个利用场景级3D流作为中间表示的新框架，通过捕捉细粒度局部运动线索来学习鲁棒的视觉运动策略，在模拟和真实机器人任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖直接观测到动作的映射或将感知输入压缩为全局特征，往往忽略了精确和接触丰富操作所需的关键局部运动线索。

Method: 提出3D FDP框架，预测采样查询点的时间轨迹，并在统一的扩散架构中基于这些交互感知流来生成动作，将操作基于局部动态同时考虑动作的全局场景影响。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试的50个任务中达到最先进性能，特别是在中等和困难设置中表现优异；在8个真实机器人任务中持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 3D流作为强大的结构化先验，支持学习可泛化的视觉运动策略，有助于开发更鲁棒和通用的机器人操作能力。

Abstract: Learning robust visuomotor policies that generalize across diverse objects
and interaction dynamics remains a central challenge in robotic manipulation.
Most existing approaches rely on direct observation-to-action mappings or
compress perceptual inputs into global or object-centric features, which often
overlook localized motion cues critical for precise and contact-rich
manipulation. We present 3D Flow Diffusion Policy (3D FDP), a novel framework
that leverages scene-level 3D flow as a structured intermediate representation
to capture fine-grained local motion cues. Our approach predicts the temporal
trajectories of sampled query points and conditions action generation on these
interaction-aware flows, implemented jointly within a unified diffusion
architecture. This design grounds manipulation in localized dynamics while
enabling the policy to reason about broader scene-level consequences of
actions. Extensive experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark show that 3D FDP
achieves state-of-the-art performance across 50 tasks, particularly excelling
on medium and hard settings. Beyond simulation, we validate our method on eight
real-robot tasks, where it consistently outperforms prior baselines in
contact-rich and non-prehensile scenarios. These results highlight 3D flow as a
powerful structural prior for learning generalizable visuomotor policies,
supporting the development of more robust and versatile robotic manipulation.

*Kaixin Chai,Hyunjun Lee,Joseph J. Lim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: N2M是一个过渡模块，用于在机器人到达任务区域后引导其到更适合操作的初始位姿，解决导航模块与操作策略之间的错位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动操作中，操作策略对初始位姿有强烈偏好，但导航模块仅关注到达任务区域，不考虑下游操作的首选位姿，这种错配导致任务成功率低。

Method: N2M模块仅依赖自我中心观察，无需全局或历史信息，具有实时适应环境变化、高视角鲁棒性、广泛适用性以及出色的数据效率和泛化能力。

Result: 在PnPCounterToCab任务中，N2M将平均成功率从基于可达性基线的3%提升至54%；在Toybox Handover任务中，仅用15个数据样本就能在未见环境中提供可靠预测。

Conclusion: N2M通过引导机器人到优选初始位姿，显著提高了移动操作任务的成功率，展示了出色的数据效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: In mobile manipulation, the manipulation policy has strong preferences for
initial poses where it is executed. However, the navigation module focuses
solely on reaching the task area, without considering which initial pose is
preferable for downstream manipulation. To address this misalignment, we
introduce N2M, a transition module that guides the robot to a preferable
initial pose after reaching the task area, thereby substantially improving task
success rates. N2M features five key advantages: (1) reliance solely on
ego-centric observation without requiring global or historical information; (2)
real-time adaptation to environmental changes; (3) reliable prediction with
high viewpoint robustness; (4) broad applicability across diverse tasks,
manipulation policies, and robot hardware; and (5) remarkable data efficiency
and generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of N2M through extensive
simulation and real-world experiments. In the PnPCounterToCab task, N2M
improves the averaged success rate from 3% with the reachability-based baseline
to 54%. Furthermore, in the Toybox Handover task, N2M provides reliable
predictions even in unseen environments with only 15 data samples, showing
remarkable data efficiency and generalizability.

Motivation: 机器人装配任务因零件交互复杂性和接触丰富环境中的噪声敏感性而具有挑战性。传统分层策略存在高层技能查询与底层执行不匹配的问题

Method: QDP框架利用包含物体、接触点和技能信息的查询，识别任务相关组件并指导底层策略，使用点云观测提高策略鲁棒性

Conclusion: QDP通过查询中心机制有效解决了分层策略中的不匹配问题，显著提升了机器人装配任务的性能

Abstract: The robotic assembly task poses a key challenge in building generalist robots
due to the intrinsic complexity of part interactions and the sensitivity to
noise perturbations in contact-rich settings. The assembly agent is typically
designed in a hierarchical manner: high-level multi-part reasoning and
low-level precise control. However, implementing such a hierarchical policy is
challenging in practice due to the mismatch between high-level skill queries
and low-level execution. To address this, we propose the Query-centric
Diffusion Policy (QDP), a hierarchical framework that bridges high-level
planning and low-level control by utilizing queries comprising objects, contact
points, and skill information. QDP introduces a query-centric mechanism that
identifies task-relevant components and uses them to guide low-level policies,
leveraging point cloud observations to improve the policy's robustness. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on the FurnitureBench in both simulation and
real-world settings, demonstrating improved performance in skill precision and
long-horizon success rate. In the challenging insertion and screwing tasks, QDP
improves the skill-wise success rate by over 50% compared to baselines without
structured queries.

Global Positioning System (GPS), narrow spaces and dynamically moving obstacles
make the path planning of an aerial robot a complicated task. One of the skills

to develop an ability to avoid collisions using information from onboard depth
sensors. In this paper, we propose Reinforcement Learning of a virtual
quadcopter robot agent equipped with a Depth Camera to navigate through a
simulated urban environment.

Motivation: 手持式抓取器作为数据收集工具虽然直观且可扩展，但仅依赖第一人称视角手腕相机难以捕捉足够的场景上下文，限制了模仿学习的应用范围。

Method: 提出MV-UMI框架，整合第三人称视角与第一人称视角相机，减少人类演示与机器人部署之间的领域偏移，同时保持手持设备的跨本体优势。

Conclusion: MV-UMI框架有效扩展了手持抓取器系统可学习的操作任务范围，且不损害其固有的跨本体优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning have shown great promise for developing
robust robot manipulation policies from demonstrations. However, this promise
is contingent on the availability of diverse, high-quality datasets, which are
not only challenging and costly to collect but are often constrained to a
specific robot embodiment. Portable handheld grippers have recently emerged as
intuitive and scalable alternatives to traditional robotic teleoperation
methods for data collection. However, their reliance solely on first-person
view wrist-mounted cameras often creates limitations in capturing sufficient
scene contexts. In this paper, we present MV-UMI (Multi-View Universal
Manipulation Interface), a framework that integrates a third-person perspective
with the egocentric camera to overcome this limitation. This integration
mitigates domain shifts between human demonstration and robot deployment,
preserving the cross-embodiment advantages of handheld data-collection devices.
Our experimental results, including an ablation study, demonstrate that our
MV-UMI framework improves performance in sub-tasks requiring broad scene
understanding by approximately 47% across 3 tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach in expanding the range of feasible manipulation tasks that can
be learned using handheld gripper systems, without compromising the
cross-embodiment advantages inherent to such systems.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注策略设计，但忽视了视觉编码器的结构和能力，限制了空间理解和泛化。受生物视觉系统启发，需要结合视觉和本体感觉线索来实现鲁棒控制

Method: 采用视觉几何基础变换器作为视觉编码器，引入本体感觉引导的视觉学习策略，设计帧级token重用机制减少推理延迟，应用随机token剪枝增强策略鲁棒性

Result: 在MetaWorld挑战任务上的实验表明，VGGT-DP显著优于DP和DP3等强基线方法，特别是在精度要求和长时程场景中表现突出

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合几何先验和本体感觉反馈，有效提升了视觉模仿学习的空间定位和闭环控制性能

Abstract: Visual imitation learning frameworks allow robots to learn manipulation
skills from expert demonstrations. While existing approaches mainly focus on
policy design, they often neglect the structure and capacity of visual
encoders, limiting spatial understanding and generalization. Inspired by
biological vision systems, which rely on both visual and proprioceptive cues
for robust control, we propose VGGT-DP, a visuomotor policy framework that
integrates geometric priors from a pretrained 3D perception model with
proprioceptive feedback. We adopt the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer
(VGGT) as the visual encoder and introduce a proprioception-guided visual
learning strategy to align perception with internal robot states, improving
spatial grounding and closed-loop control. To reduce inference latency, we
design a frame-wise token reuse mechanism that compacts multi-view tokens into
an efficient spatial representation. We further apply random token pruning to
enhance policy robustness and reduce overfitting. Experiments on challenging
MetaWorld tasks show that VGGT-DP significantly outperforms strong baselines
such as DP and DP3, particularly in precision-critical and long-horizon
scenarios.

Conclusion: GP-CA方法能够有效处理点云配准中的不确定性，提供可解释的不确定性分析，增强了机器人感知的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the point cloud registration problem, where
well-known methods like ICP fail under uncertainty arising from sensor noise,
pose-estimation errors, and partial overlap due to occlusion. We develop a
novel approach, Gaussian Process Concept Attribution (GP-CA), which not only
quantifies registration uncertainty but also explains it by attributing
uncertainty to well-known sources of errors in registration problems. Our
approach leverages active learning to discover new uncertainty sources in the
wild by querying informative instances. We validate GP-CA on three publicly
available datasets and in our real-world robot experiment. Extensive ablations
substantiate our design choices. Our approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in terms of runtime, high sample-efficiency with
active learning, and high accuracy. Our real-world experiment clearly
demonstrates its applicability. Our video also demonstrates that GP-CA enables
effective failure-recovery behaviors, yielding more robust robotic perception.

Conclusion: DexSkin展示了其在学习真实世界、接触丰富的操作任务方面的适用性和实用性，为机器人触觉感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human skin provides a rich tactile sensing stream, localizing intentional and
unintentional contact events over a large and contoured region. Replicating
these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems
remains a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this
goal by introducing DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive
electronic skin that enables sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile
sensing, and can be tailored to varying geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy
for learning downstream robotic manipulation by sensorizing a pair of parallel
jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage across almost the entire finger
surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin's capabilities in learning
challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across the entire
surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping
elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then
show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to
enable model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its
applicability to online reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results
highlight DexSkin's suitability and practicality for learning real-world,
contact-rich manipulation. Please see our project webpage for videos and

Conclusion: Bi-VLA解决了先前双边控制方法的单任务限制，提供了实证证据表明视觉和语言的结合显著增强了方法的通用性

Abstract: We propose Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Vision-Language
Fusion for Action Generation (Bi-VLA), a novel framework that extends bilateral
control-based imitation learning to handle more than one task within a single
model. Conventional bilateral control methods exploit joint angle, velocity,
torque, and vision for precise manipulation but require task-specific models,
limiting their generality. Bi-VLA overcomes this limitation by utilizing robot
joint angle, velocity, and torque data from leader-follower bilateral control
with visual features and natural language instructions through SigLIP and
FiLM-based fusion. We validated Bi-VLA on two task types: one requiring
supplementary language cues and another distinguishable solely by vision.
Real-robot experiments showed that Bi-VLA successfully interprets
vision-language combinations and improves task success rates compared to
conventional bilateral control-based imitation learning. Our Bi-VLA addresses
the single-task limitation of prior bilateral approaches and provides empirical
evidence that combining vision and language significantly enhances versatility.
Experimental results validate the effectiveness of Bi-VLA in real-world tasks.

Motivation: 传统机器人手设计依赖专家启发式方法和手动调参，自动化优化方法计算密集且依赖仿真，难以针对灵巧手进行设计。大语言模型在人类-物体交互知识方面具有优势，为零样本设计推理提供了新可能。

Method: Lang2Morph包含两个主要阶段：(i)形态设计：将任务映射为语义标签、结构语法和OPH兼容参数；(ii)选择与精炼：基于语义对齐和尺寸兼容性评估设计候选，并在需要时应用LLM引导的精炼。

Result: 在不同任务上的评估表明，该方法能够生成多样化且与任务相关的形态结构。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于LLM的任务条件化机器人手设计框架，展示了语言驱动设计管道的可行性。

Abstract: Designing robotic hand morphologies for diverse manipulation tasks requires
balancing dexterity, manufacturability, and task-specific functionality. While
open-source frameworks and parametric tools support reproducible design, they
still rely on expert heuristics and manual tuning. Automated methods using
optimization are often compute-intensive, simulation-dependent, and rarely
target dexterous hands. Large language models (LLMs), with their broad
knowledge of human-object interactions and strong generative capabilities,
offer a promising alternative for zero-shot design reasoning. In this paper, we
present Lang2Morph, a language-driven pipeline for robotic hand design. It uses
LLMs to translate natural-language task descriptions into symbolic structures
and OPH-compatible parameters, enabling 3D-printable task-specific
morphologies. The pipeline consists of: (i) Morphology Design, which maps tasks
into semantic tags, structural grammars, and OPH-compatible parameters; and
(ii) Selection and Refinement, which evaluates design candidates based on
semantic alignment and size compatibility, and optionally applies LLM-guided
refinement when needed. We evaluate Lang2Morph across varied tasks, and results
show that our approach can generate diverse, task-relevant morphologies. To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop an LLM-based framework for
task-conditioned robotic hand design.

Motivation: VLA模型在机器人操作中表现出潜力，但其对现实世界物理变化的鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索，需要系统评估方法。

Method: 将现实变化分解为三个关键领域：物体3D变换、光照变化和对抗性补丁；引入连续黑盒优化框架将离散物理变化转化为参数优化问题。

Result: 实验显示所有变化类型都导致超过60%的失败率，物体变换在长时程任务中造成高达97.8%的失败率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了实验室成功与部署准备之间的关键差距，Eva-VLA框架为增强VLA模型对抗现实世界挑战提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as promising solutions for
robotic manipulation, yet their robustness to real-world physical variations
remains critically underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Eva-VLA, the
first unified framework that systematically evaluates the robustness of VLA
models by transforming discrete physical variations into continuous
optimization problems. However, comprehensively assessing VLA robustness
presents two key challenges: (1) how to systematically characterize diverse
physical variations encountered in real-world deployments while maintaining
evaluation reproducibility, and (2) how to discover worst-case scenarios
without prohibitive real-world data collection costs efficiently. To address
the first challenge, we decompose real-world variations into three critical
domains: object 3D transformations that affect spatial reasoning, illumination
variations that challenge visual perception, and adversarial patches that
disrupt scene understanding. For the second challenge, we introduce a
continuous black-box optimization framework that transforms discrete physical
variations into parameter optimization, enabling systematic exploration of
worst-case scenarios. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art OpenVLA models
across multiple benchmarks reveal alarming vulnerabilities: all variation types
trigger failure rates exceeding 60%, with object transformations causing up to
97.8% failure in long-horizon tasks. Our findings expose critical gaps between
controlled laboratory success and unpredictable deployment readiness, while the
Eva-VLA framework provides a practical pathway for hardening VLA-based robotic
manipulation models against real-world deployment challenges.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度学习的框架，用于在ICP匹配前预测注册误差协方差，无需参考地图即可为LiDAR扫描提供6自由度误差协方差估计，从而提升定位精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICP算法在特征缺失环境和动态场景中容易产生误差，现有不确定性估计方法依赖手工模型或简化假设，而深度学习方法要么需要预建地图，要么仅提供二元分类，无法正确建模不确定性。

Method: 采用数据驱动的深度学习框架，在ICP匹配前预测注册误差协方差，无需参考地图即可为每个LiDAR扫描生成可靠的6自由度误差协方差估计。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法能准确预测协方差，应用于基于预建地图的定位或SLAM时，能减少定位误差并提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效预测ICP注册误差协方差，实现与卡尔曼滤波的无缝集成，显著提升LiDAR定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization and SLAM often rely on iterative matching
algorithms, particularly the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, to align
sensor data with pre-existing maps or previous scans. However, ICP is prone to
errors in featureless environments and dynamic scenes, leading to inaccurate
pose estimation. Accurately predicting the uncertainty associated with ICP is
crucial for robust state estimation but remains challenging, as existing
approaches often rely on handcrafted models or simplified assumptions.
Moreover, a few deep learning-based methods for localizability estimation
either depend on a pre-built map, which may not always be available, or provide
a binary classification of localizable versus non-localizable, which fails to
properly model uncertainty. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework
that leverages deep learning to estimate the registration error covariance of
ICP before matching, even in the absence of a reference map. By associating
each LiDAR scan with a reliable 6-DoF error covariance estimate, our method
enables seamless integration of ICP within Kalman filtering, enhancing
localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it
accurately predicts covariance and, when applied to localization using a
pre-built map or SLAM, reduces localization errors and improves robustness.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种快速、可证明全局最优的物体形状和姿态估计解决方案，适用于实时机器人应用。

Abstract: Object shape and pose estimation is a foundational robotics problem,
supporting tasks from manipulation to scene understanding and navigation. We
present a fast local solver for shape and pose estimation which requires only
category-level object priors and admits an efficient certificate of global
optimality. Given an RGB-D image of an object, we use a learned front-end to
detect sparse, category-level semantic keypoints on the target object. We
represent the target object's unknown shape using a linear active shape model
and pose a maximum a posteriori optimization problem to solve for position,
orientation, and shape simultaneously. Expressed in unit quaternions, this
problem admits first-order optimality conditions in the form of an eigenvalue
problem with eigenvector nonlinearities. Our primary contribution is to solve
this problem efficiently with self-consistent field iteration, which only
requires computing a 4-by-4 matrix and finding its minimum eigenvalue-vector
pair at each iterate. Solving a linear system for the corresponding Lagrange
multipliers gives a simple global optimality certificate. One iteration of our
solver runs in about 100 microseconds, enabling fast outlier rejection. We test
our method on synthetic data and a variety of real-world settings, including
two public datasets and a drone tracking scenario. Code is released at

Abstract: The emergence of Vision Language Action (VLA) models marks a paradigm shift
from traditional policy-based control to generalized robotics, reframing Vision
Language Models (VLMs) from passive sequence generators into active agents for
manipulation and decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. This survey
delves into advanced VLA methods, aiming to provide a clear taxonomy and a
systematic, comprehensive review of existing research. It presents a
comprehensive analysis of VLA applications across different scenarios and
classifies VLA approaches into several paradigms: autoregression-based,
diffusion-based, reinforcement-based, hybrid, and specialized methods; while
examining their motivations, core strategies, and implementations in detail. In
addition, foundational datasets, benchmarks, and simulation platforms are
introduced. Building on the current VLA landscape, the review further proposes
perspectives on key challenges and future directions to advance research in VLA

### [230] [Reduced-Order Model-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Demonstration-Free Humanoid Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19023)
*Shuai Liu,Meng Cheng Lau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROM-GRL是一个两阶段强化学习框架，用于人形机器人行走，无需运动捕捉数据或复杂奖励设计。第一阶段训练4-DOF简化模型生成步态模板，第二阶段用这些轨迹指导全身体策略学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人行走中需要大量运动捕捉数据或复杂奖励设计的问题，提供更自然、稳定的步态生成方法。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）用PPO训练4-DOF简化模型生成能量高效步态；2）用SAC+对抗判别器训练全身体策略，使其步态特征分布与简化模型匹配。

Result: 在1m/s和4m/s速度下，ROM-GRL产生稳定对称的步态，跟踪误差显著低于纯奖励基线方法。

Conclusion: ROM-GRL通过将轻量级简化模型指导融入高维策略，填补了纯奖励方法和基于模仿方法之间的空白，无需人类演示即可实现多功能、自然的人形行为。

Abstract: We introduce Reduced-Order Model-Guided Reinforcement Learning (ROM-GRL), a
two-stage reinforcement learning framework for humanoid walking that requires
no motion capture data or elaborate reward shaping. In the first stage, a
compact 4-DOF (four-degree-of-freedom) reduced-order model (ROM) is trained via
Proximal Policy Optimization. This generates energy-efficient gait templates.
In the second stage, those dynamically consistent trajectories guide a
full-body policy trained with Soft Actor--Critic augmented by an adversarial
discriminator, ensuring the student's five-dimensional gait feature
distribution matches the ROM's demonstrations. Experiments at 1
meter-per-second and 4 meter-per-second show that ROM-GRL produces stable,
symmetric gaits with substantially lower tracking error than a pure-reward
baseline. By distilling lightweight ROM guidance into high-dimensional
policies, ROM-GRL bridges the gap between reward-only and imitation-based
locomotion methods, enabling versatile, naturalistic humanoid behaviors without
any human demonstrations.

*Qingzheng Cong,Steven Oh,Wen Fan,Shan Luo,Kaspar Althoefer,Dandan Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TacEva是一个用于视觉触觉传感器(VBTS)的全面评估框架，通过定义标准化性能指标和实验流程来解决VBTS性能评估缺乏统一标准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉触觉传感器在传感机制、结构尺寸等参数上存在差异，导致性能差异显著，但由于缺乏标准化指标，难以针对特定任务进行优化选择和调优。

Method: 开发了TacEva框架，定义了一套性能指标来捕捉典型应用场景中的关键特征，并为每个指标设计了结构化的实验流程以确保一致性和可重复性量化。

Result: 该框架应用于多个具有不同传感机制的VBTS，结果显示能够对每种设计进行全面评估，并为每个性能维度提供定量指标。

Conclusion: TacEva使研究人员能够基于任务需求预先选择最合适的VBTS，同时为VBTS设计的优化提供性能指导的见解。

Abstract: Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) are widely used in robotic tasks because
of the high spatial resolution they offer and their relatively low
manufacturing costs. However, variations in their sensing mechanisms,
structural dimension, and other parameters lead to significant performance
disparities between existing VBTSs. This makes it challenging to optimize them
for specific tasks, as both the initial choice and subsequent fine-tuning are
hindered by the lack of standardized metrics. To address this issue, TacEva is
introduced as a comprehensive evaluation framework for the quantitative
analysis of VBTS performance. The framework defines a set of performance
metrics that capture key characteristics in typical application scenarios. For
each metric, a structured experimental pipeline is designed to ensure
consistent and repeatable quantification. The framework is applied to multiple
VBTSs with distinct sensing mechanisms, and the results demonstrate its ability
to provide a thorough evaluation of each design and quantitative indicators for
each performance dimension. This enables researchers to pre-select the most
appropriate VBTS on a task by task basis, while also offering
performance-guided insights into the optimization of VBTS design. A list of
existing VBTS evaluation methods and additional evaluations can be found on our

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了ManipForce系统来采集接触丰富的操作任务中的力-力矩和视觉数据，并开发了频率感知多模态变换器（FMT）来融合这些异步多模态信号，在六个真实世界接触操作任务中实现了83%的平均成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模仿学习方法主要依赖纯视觉演示，但对于需要精确控制交互力的接触丰富操作任务（如精密装配）来说，仅靠视觉数据不足以实现精确控制。

Method: 开发了手持式ManipForce系统采集高频力-力矩和RGB数据；提出了频率感知多模态变换器（FMT），使用频率和模态感知嵌入编码异步RGB和力-力矩信号，并通过双向交叉注意力在变换器扩散策略中融合多模态信息。

Result: 在六个真实世界接触操作任务（齿轮装配、盒子翻转、电池插入等）中，基于ManipForce演示训练的FMT实现了83%的平均成功率，显著优于仅使用RGB的基线方法。

Conclusion: 实验证明，结合高频力-力矩数据和跨模态集成能够显著提升策略性能，特别是在需要高精度和稳定接触的任务中效果尤为明显。

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation tasks such as precision assembly require precise
control of interaction forces, yet existing imitation learning methods rely
mainly on vision-only demonstrations. We propose ManipForce, a handheld system
designed to capture high-frequency force-torque (F/T) and RGB data during
natural human demonstrations for contact-rich manipulation. Building on these
demonstrations, we introduce the Frequency-Aware Multimodal Transformer (FMT).
FMT encodes asynchronous RGB and F/T signals using frequency- and
modality-aware embeddings and fuses them via bi-directional cross-attention
within a transformer diffusion policy. Through extensive experiments on six
real-world contact-rich manipulation tasks - such as gear assembly, box
flipping, and battery insertion - FMT trained on ManipForce demonstrations
achieves robust performance with an average success rate of 83% across all
tasks, substantially outperforming RGB-only baselines. Ablation and
sampling-frequency analyses further confirm that incorporating high-frequency
F/T data and cross-modal integration improves policy performance, especially in
tasks demanding high precision and stable contact.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: World4RL是一个利用扩散模型作为高保真模拟器的框架，用于在想象环境中优化预训练的机器人操作策略，避免了真实世界交互的成本和风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作策略通常通过模仿学习初始化，但受限于专家数据的稀缺性和覆盖范围。强化学习可以优化策略，但真实机器人训练成本高且不安全，而模拟器训练存在模拟到现实的差距。扩散模型在真实世界模拟方面表现出色，因此研究如何将其与预训练策略结合来增强机器人操作性能。

Method: 提出World4RL框架，基于两个原则：1）在多任务数据集上预训练捕捉多样动态的扩散世界模型；2）在冻结的世界模型中完全优化策略，避免在线真实世界交互。设计了专门针对机器人操作的双热动作编码方案，并采用扩散骨干网络提高建模保真度。

Result: 广泛的模拟和真实世界实验表明，World4RL提供了高保真的环境建模，实现了稳定的策略优化，相比模仿学习和其他基线方法获得了显著更高的成功率。

Conclusion: World4RL框架成功地将扩散模型作为世界模型用于机器人操作策略的端到端优化，为机器人学习提供了一种高效且安全的训练方法。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are commonly initialized through imitation
learning, but their performance is limited by the scarcity and narrow coverage
of expert data. Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this
limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in
simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative
models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with
diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the
question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance
pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose
World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as
high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined
environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ
world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy
optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a
diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and
refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online
real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme
tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve
modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate
that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables
consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates
compared to imitation learning and other baselines. More visualization results
are available at https://world4rl.github.io/.

TL;DR: FunCanon框架将长时程操作任务分解为动作块序列，通过功能对象规范化实现姿态感知和类别泛化，使用基于扩散的策略FuncDiffuser在功能对齐数据上训练，提高泛化能力和行为复用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端演示学习的任务特定策略泛化能力差的问题，实现类别级泛化和跨任务行为复用。

Method: 将任务分解为动作块（执行者-动词-对象），通过功能对象规范化进行功能对齐和自动轨迹迁移，使用对象中心和动作中心的扩散策略FuncDiffuser。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界基准测试中展示了类别级泛化、跨任务行为复用和稳健的仿真到真实部署。

Conclusion: 功能规范化为复杂操作领域的可扩展模仿学习提供了强归纳偏置。

Abstract: General-purpose robotic skills from end-to-end demonstrations often leads to
task-specific policies that fail to generalize beyond the training
distribution. Therefore, we introduce FunCanon, a framework that converts
long-horizon manipulation tasks into sequences of action chunks, each defined
by an actor, verb, and object. These chunks focus policy learning on the
actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and
reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional
object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation
trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using
affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action
centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally
respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving
generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks
demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and
robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a
strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation
domains. Details of the demo and supplemental material are available on our
project website https://sites.google.com/view/funcanon.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RS-Net是一个深度神经网络，能够从RGB图像预测光谱特征，从而获取地形材质信息，用于机器人户外导航中的地形分类和摩擦系数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外导航需要准确预测机器人与地形的物理交互。现有方法依赖几何或语义标签，但无法区分视觉相似但材质不同的表面。光谱传感能提供材质信息，但受限于硬件成本和处理复杂度。

Method: 提出RS-Net神经网络，从RGB图像块预测光谱特征，映射到地形标签和摩擦系数。将地形分类集成到基于采样的运动规划器中，摩擦估计集成到基于接触力的MPC控制器中。

Result: 开发了一个框架，在训练期间学习任务相关的物理属性，测试时仅需RGB传感。代码已开源。

Conclusion: RS-Net填补了RGB传感可访问性与光谱数据丰富材质信息之间的差距，为机器人户外导航提供了实用的材质感知解决方案。

Abstract: Successful navigation in outdoor environments requires accurate prediction of
the physical interactions between the robot and the terrain. To this end,
several methods rely on geometric or semantic labels to classify traversable
surfaces. However, such labels cannot distinguish visually similar surfaces
that differ in material properties. Spectral sensors enable inference of
material composition from surface reflectance measured across multiple
wavelength bands. Although spectral sensing is gaining traction in robotics,
widespread deployment remains constrained by the need for custom hardware
integration, high sensor costs, and compute-intensive processing pipelines. In
this paper, we present RGB Image to Spectral Signature Neural Network (RS-Net),
a deep neural network designed to bridge the gap between the accessibility of
RGB sensing and the rich material information provided by spectral data. RS-Net
predicts spectral signatures from RGB patches, which we map to terrain labels
and friction coefficients. The resulting terrain classifications are integrated
into a sampling-based motion planner for a wheeled robot operating in outdoor
environments. Likewise, the friction estimates are incorporated into a
contact-force-based MPC for a quadruped robot navigating slippery surfaces.
Thus, we introduce a framework that learns the task-relevant physical property
once during training and thereafter relies solely on RGB sensing at test time.

TL;DR: BiGraspFormer是一个统一的端到端Transformer框架，直接从物体点云生成协调的双臂抓取，解决了现有方法中协调问题如碰撞风险和力分布不平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双臂抓取方法要么只关注单臂抓取，要么采用分离的抓取生成和双臂评估阶段，导致协调问题包括碰撞风险和力分布不平衡。

Method: 提出Single-Guided Bimanual (SGB)策略：首先使用Transformer解码器生成多样化的单臂抓取候选，然后通过专门的注意力机制利用其学习特征来联合预测双臂姿态和质量分数。

Result: 综合仿真实验和真实世界验证表明，BiGraspFormer始终优于现有方法，同时保持高效的推理速度（<0.05秒）。

Conclusion: BiGraspFormer框架在解决双臂抓取协调问题方面表现出有效性，代码和补充材料已公开。

Abstract: Bimanual grasping is essential for robots to handle large and complex
objects. However, existing methods either focus solely on single-arm grasping
or employ separate grasp generation and bimanual evaluation stages, leading to
coordination problems including collision risks and unbalanced force
distribution. To address these limitations, we propose BiGraspFormer, a unified
end-to-end transformer framework that directly generates coordinated bimanual
grasps from object point clouds. Our key idea is the Single-Guided Bimanual
(SGB) strategy, which first generates diverse single grasp candidates using a
transformer decoder, then leverages their learned features through specialized
attention mechanisms to jointly predict bimanual poses and quality scores. This
conditioning strategy reduces the complexity of the 12-DoF search space while
ensuring coordinated bimanual manipulation. Comprehensive simulation
experiments and real-world validation demonstrate that BiGraspFormer
consistently outperforms existing methods while maintaining efficient inference
speed (<0.05s), confirming the effectiveness of our framework. Code and

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理多模态规划问题，提高系统鲁棒性，同时避免集中式优化的计算复杂度

Abstract: In this paper, we present a receding-horizon, sampling-based planner capable
of reasoning over multimodal policy distributions. By using the cross-entropy
method to optimize a multimodal policy under a common cost function, our
approach increases robustness against local minima and promotes effective
exploration of the solution space. We show that our approach naturally extends
to multi-robot collision-free planning, enables agents to share diverse
candidate policies to avoid deadlocks, and allows teams to minimize a global
objective without incurring the computational complexity of centralized
optimization. Numerical simulations demonstrate that employing multiple modes
significantly improves success rates in trap environments and in multi-robot
collision avoidance. Hardware experiments further validate the approach's
real-time feasibility and practical performance.

Abstract: The transfer of manipulation skills from human demonstration to robotic
execution is often hindered by a "domain gap" in sensing and morphology. This
paper introduces MagiClaw, a versatile two-finger end-effector designed to
bridge this gap. MagiClaw functions interchangeably as both a handheld tool for
intuitive data collection and a robotic end-effector for policy deployment,
ensuring hardware consistency and reliability. Each finger incorporates a Soft
Polyhedral Network (SPN) with an embedded camera, enabling vision-based
estimation of 6-DoF forces and contact deformation. This proprioceptive data is
fused with exteroceptive environmental sensing from an integrated iPhone, which
provides 6D pose, RGB video, and LiDAR-based depth maps. Through a custom iOS
application, MagiClaw streams synchronized, multi-modal data for real-time
teleoperation, offline policy learning, and immersive control via mixed-reality
interfaces. We demonstrate how this unified system architecture lowers the
barrier to collecting high-fidelity, contact-rich datasets and accelerates the
development of generalizable manipulation policies. Please refer to the iOS app

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in dynamic environments often requires seamless
transitions between different grasp types to maintain stability and efficiency.
However, achieving smooth and adaptive grasp transitions remains a challenge,
particularly when dealing with external forces and complex motion constraints.
Existing grasp transition strategies often fail to account for varying external
forces and do not optimize motion performance effectively. In this work, we
propose an Imitation-Guided Bimanual Planning Framework that integrates
efficient grasp transition strategies and motion performance optimization to
enhance stability and dexterity in robotic manipulation. Our approach
introduces Strategies for Sampling Stable Intersections in Grasp Manifolds for
seamless transitions between uni-manual and bi-manual grasps, reducing
computational costs and regrasping inefficiencies. Additionally, a Hierarchical
Dual-Stage Motion Architecture combines an Imitation Learning-based Global Path
Generator with a Quadratic Programming-driven Local Planner to ensure real-time
motion feasibility, obstacle avoidance, and superior manipulability. The
proposed method is evaluated through a series of force-intensive tasks,
demonstrating significant improvements in grasp transition efficiency and
motion performance. A video demonstrating our simulation results can be viewed

TL;DR: SOE是一个通过流形约束探索来增强机器人策略自我改进的框架，解决了传统随机扰动方法的不安全和不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人策略探索方法依赖随机扰动，导致不安全和不稳定行为，限制了探索效果。需要一种安全有效的探索机制。

Method: 学习任务相关因素的紧凑潜在表示，将探索约束在有效动作的流形上，可作为插件模块与任意策略模型集成。

Result: 在仿真和真实任务中，SOE优于现有方法，实现更高的任务成功率、更平滑安全的探索和更好的样本效率。

Conclusion: 流形约束探索为样本高效的策略自我改进提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Intelligent agents progress by continually refining their capabilities
through actively exploring environments. Yet robot policies often lack
sufficient exploration capability due to action mode collapse. Existing methods
that encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are
unsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their
effectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a
framework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic
manipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant
factors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring
safety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with
arbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without
degrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space
enables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and
controllability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks
demonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher
task success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample
efficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled
approach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website:

Conclusion: 该方法为在真实世界中部署RL提供了一条实用途径，展示了结合BC和RL的残差学习框架的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in behavior cloning (BC) have enabled impressive visuomotor
control policies. However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human
demonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the
diminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement
learning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the
environment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still,
training RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to
sample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from
sparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom
(DoF) systems. We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL
through a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as
black-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via
sample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only
sparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies
on high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world.
In particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first
successful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands. Our
results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various vision-based tasks,
pointing towards a practical pathway for deploying RL in the real world.

### [243] [MMCD: Multi-Modal Collaborative Decision-Making for Connected Autonomy with Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18198)
*Rui Liu,Zikang Wang,Peng Gao,Yu Shen,Pratap Tokekar,Ming Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MMCD框架，通过多模态协同决策和跨模态知识蒸馏解决自动驾驶中传感器故障或连接车辆缺失时的鲁棒决策问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设训练和测试时所有数据模态和连接车辆都可用，这不切实际，因为可能发生传感器故障或连接车辆缺失

Method: MMCD框架融合自车和协作车的多模态观测数据，采用基于教师-学生模型的跨模态知识蒸馏方法，教师模型使用多模态数据训练，学生模型设计为在模态减少时仍能有效运行

Result: 在连接自动驾驶和空地车辆协作实验中，该方法将驾驶安全性提高了20.7%，在潜在事故检测和安全驾驶决策方面超越了现有最佳基线

Conclusion: MMCD框架能够有效提升自动驾驶系统在挑战性环境下的决策鲁棒性和安全性

Abstract: Autonomous systems have advanced significantly, but challenges persist in
accident-prone environments where robust decision-making is crucial. A single
vehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of
accidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches,
leveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising
solutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data
modalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is
impractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal
Collaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses
multi-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance
decision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when
certain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach
based on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model
structure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while
the student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities.
In experiments on $\textit{connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles}$
and $\textit{aerial-ground vehicles collaboration}$, our method improves
driving safety by up to ${\it 20.7}\%$, surpassing the best-existing baseline
in detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions. More

### [244] [A Cost-Benefit Analysis of On-Premise Large Language Model Deployment: Breaking Even with Commercial LLM Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18101)
*Guanzhong Pan,Haibo Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个成本效益分析框架，帮助组织确定何时本地部署开源LLM比商业订阅服务更经济可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，组织面临选择商业云服务还是本地部署的决策。商业服务虽然方便但存在数据隐私、供应商锁定和长期成本问题，因此需要系统分析本地部署的经济可行性。

Method: 构建成本效益分析框架，考虑硬件需求、运营费用和开源模型性能基准，将本地部署总成本与主要云服务商订阅费用进行比较。

Result: 研究提供了基于使用水平和性能需求的盈亏平衡点估计，为组织规划LLM策略提供实用框架。

Conclusion: 本地部署开源LLM在某些使用场景下具有经济优势，组织可以根据具体需求通过该框架做出更明智的部署决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread.
Organizations that want to use AI for productivity now face an important
decision. They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on
their own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI,
Anthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to
state-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data
privacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating
costs have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This
paper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations
determine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared
to commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements,
operational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source
models, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost
of deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription
fee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels
and performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework
for planning their LLM strategies.

### [245] [Change in Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation: Sufficient, Necessary, and Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18215)
*Timotheus Kampik,Kristijonas Čyras,José Ruiz Alarcón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种形式化方法来解释定量双极论证框架（QBAF）中推理变化的原因，通过追踪论证强度不一致性并识别其解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在QBAF中反复推理和更新时，论证强度排序可能出现不一致性，需要系统化方法来解释这些变化的原因。

Method: 定义强度不一致性概念，识别充分、必要和反事实解释，开发基于启发式的解释搜索方法并提供实现。

Result: 证明了强度不一致性解释存在的充要条件，并实现了有效的解释搜索算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为QBAF中的推理变化提供了形式化解释框架，有助于理解和调试论证系统的动态行为。

Abstract: This paper presents a formal approach to explaining change of inference in
Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs). When drawing conclusions
from a QBAF and updating the QBAF to then again draw conclusions (and so on),
our approach traces changes -- which we call strength inconsistencies -- in the
partial order over argument strengths that a semantics establishes on some
arguments of interest, called topic arguments. We trace the causes of strength
inconsistencies to specific arguments, which then serve as explanations. We
identify sufficient, necessary, and counterfactual explanations for strength
inconsistencies and show that strength inconsistency explanations exist if and
only if an update leads to strength inconsistency. We define a heuristic-based
approach to facilitate the search for strength inconsistency explanations, for
which we also provide an implementation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPADE是一个利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行土壤湿度时间序列分析的集成框架，能够零样本检测灌溉模式和异常，无需任务特定标注或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有土壤湿度时间序列分析方法依赖基于阈值的规则或数据密集型机器学习模型，存在适应性和可解释性限制。

Method: SPADE利用ChatGPT-4.1的推理能力，将时间序列数据转换为文本表示，通过领域知识提示模板识别灌溉事件、估计净灌溉增益、检测和分类异常。

Result: 在真实农田数据上的实验表明，SPADE在异常检测方面优于现有方法，具有更高的召回率和F1分数，并能准确分类异常类型。灌溉事件检测也达到高精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLMs作为精准农业可扩展、适应性工具的潜力，能够整合定性知识和数据驱动推理，为土壤湿度监测和灌溉调度提供可操作见解。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of soil moisture patterns is critical for irrigation
scheduling and crop management, yet existing approaches for soil moisture
time-series analysis either rely on threshold-based rules or data-hungry
machine learning or deep learning models that are limited in adaptability and
interpretability. In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and
Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil
moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced
reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis
without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting
time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed
prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation
gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable
reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data
from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the
United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method
in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately
classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and
recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to
capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide
interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study
highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision
agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and
data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture
monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series
data.

### [247] [Position Paper: Integrating Explainability and Uncertainty Estimation in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18132)
*Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出可解释不确定性估计（XUE）框架，将可解释性与不确定性量化相结合，以解决医疗AI中现有解释方法缺乏置信度评估和不确定性技术缺乏直观解释的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗AI系统无法以符合临床推理的方式明确量化或传达不确定性，现有可解释AI工作仅解释模型预测而不捕获预测的置信度，而不确定性估计技术提供置信度但缺乏直观解释，这种脱节限制了AI在医学中的采用。

Method: 提出XUE框架，系统地将医学不确定性映射到AI不确定性概念，识别XUE实施的关键挑战，并规划技术方向包括多模态不确定性量化、模型无关可视化技术和不确定性感知决策支持系统。

Result: 分析强调了需要开发既能生成可靠预测又能以临床有意义的方式表达置信度的AI系统，为弥合可解释性和不确定性之间的差距提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过桥接可解释性和不确定性，为开发与真实世界临床复杂性相一致的值得信赖的医疗AI系统铺平了道路，提出了确保有效XUE实现的指导原则。

Abstract: Uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in medical practice, but current
medical AI systems fail to explicitly quantify or communicate uncertainty in a
way that aligns with clinical reasoning. Existing XAI works focus on
interpreting model predictions but do not capture the confidence or reliability
of these predictions. Conversely, uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques
provide confidence measures but lack intuitive explanations. The disconnect
between these two areas limits AI adoption in medicine. To address this gap, we
propose Explainable Uncertainty Estimation (XUE) that integrates explainability
with uncertainty quantification to enhance trust and usability in medical AI.
We systematically map medical uncertainty to AI uncertainty concepts and
identify key challenges in implementing XUE. We outline technical directions
for advancing XUE, including multimodal uncertainty quantification,
model-agnostic visualization techniques, and uncertainty-aware decision support
systems. Lastly, we propose guiding principles to ensure effective XUE
realisation. Our analysis highlights the need for AI systems that not only
generate reliable predictions but also articulate confidence levels in a
clinically meaningful way. This work contributes to the development of
trustworthy medical AI by bridging explainability and uncertainty, paving the
way for AI systems that are aligned with real-world clinical complexities.

### [248] [HSGM: Hierarchical Segment-Graph Memory for Scalable Long-Text Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18168)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSGM是一种分层分段图内存框架，通过将长文档分解为有意义的段落，构建局部语义图并提取摘要节点来形成全局图内存，显著降低了长文档语义解析的计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文档语义解析面临二次复杂度增长和内存需求过高的挑战，传统方法难以处理超长文本。

Method: HSGM框架将输入文档分解为M个段落，在每个段落上构建局部语义图，提取摘要节点形成全局图内存，支持增量更新和分层查询处理。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，HSGM实现了2-4倍推理加速，峰值内存减少超过60%，同时保持≥95%的基线准确率。

Conclusion: HSGM为超长文本的可扩展、准确语义建模提供了解决方案，使实时和资源受限的NLP应用成为可能。

Abstract: Semantic parsing of long documents remains challenging due to quadratic
growth in pairwise composition and memory requirements. We introduce
\textbf{Hierarchical Segment-Graph Memory (HSGM)}, a novel framework that
decomposes an input of length $N$ into $M$ meaningful segments, constructs
\emph{Local Semantic Graphs} on each segment, and extracts compact
\emph{summary nodes} to form a \emph{Global Graph Memory}. HSGM supports
\emph{incremental updates} -- only newly arrived segments incur local graph
construction and summary-node integration -- while \emph{Hierarchical Query
Processing} locates relevant segments via top-$K$ retrieval over summary nodes
and then performs fine-grained reasoning within their local graphs.
  Theoretically, HSGM reduces worst-case complexity from $O(N^2)$ to
$O\!\left(N\,k + (N/k)^2\right)$, with segment size $k \ll N$, and we derive
Frobenius-norm bounds on the approximation error introduced by node
summarization and sparsification thresholds. Empirically, on three benchmarks
-- long-document AMR parsing, segment-level semantic role labeling (OntoNotes),
and legal event extraction -- HSGM achieves \emph{2--4$\times$ inference
speedup}, \emph{$>60\%$ reduction} in peak memory, and \emph{$\ge 95\%$} of
baseline accuracy. Our approach unlocks scalable, accurate semantic modeling
for ultra-long texts, enabling real-time and resource-constrained NLP
applications.

*Ling Yue,Nithin Somasekharan,Tingwen Zhang,Yadi Cao,Shaowu Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foam-Agent是一个多智能体框架，通过单个自然语言提示自动化整个OpenFOAM CFD仿真工作流程，显著降低了CFD的使用门槛


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFD仿真工具学习曲线陡峭且设置复杂，现有系统存在功能不完整、集成性差等问题，需要开发端到端的自动化解决方案

Method: 采用多智能体架构，包含网格生成代理、HPC脚本自动生成、后处理可视化等功能；使用Model Context Protocol实现可组合服务架构；通过分层多索引RAG实现高精度配置生成

Result: 在110个仿真任务基准测试中，Foam-Agent达到88.2%的成功率，显著优于现有框架（MetaOpenFOAM为55.5%）

Conclusion: Foam-Agent有效降低了CFD的专业门槛，展示了专用多智能体系统在复杂科学计算民主化方面的潜力

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in
engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create
significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a
multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow
from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical
gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation:
Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline,
including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of
handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic
generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via
ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent,
the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as
discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other
agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3.
High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a
Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a
dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2%
success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing
frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the
expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems
can democratize complex scientific computing. The code is public at

### [250] [Large Language Models and Operations Research: A Structured Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18180)
*Yang Wang,Kai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文综述了将大语言模型（LLMs）集成到运筹学（OR）中的最新进展，主要关注自动建模、辅助优化和直接求解三个方向，并讨论了评估基准、应用领域及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运筹学方法依赖专家建模和手动参数调整，难以处理大规模、动态和多约束问题。LLMs通过语义理解、结构化生成和推理控制，有望解决这些局限性。

Method: 论文将LLMs在OR中的应用方法组织为三个主要方向：自动建模（将自然语言描述转换为数学模型或可执行代码）、辅助优化（生成启发式算法、演化算法）和直接求解优化任务。

Result: 综述了LLMs在OR中的评估基准和特定领域应用，总结了关键开放问题，如语义到结构映射的不稳定性、研究进展的碎片化、泛化能力有限和评估体系不足。

Conclusion: 论文概述了推进LLMs在OR中作用的可能研究途径，强调了LLMs在提升运筹学决策支持能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Operations research (OR) provides fundamental methodologies for complex
system decision-making, with established applications in transportation, supply
chain management, and production scheduling. Traditional approaches, which
depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face
challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these
limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and
reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into
mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms,
and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on
the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions:
automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further
reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes
key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented
research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems.
Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role
of LLMs in OR.

### [251] [Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting Actions (SAPA): Behavioral Theory-Guided LLMs for Ridesourcing Mode Choice Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18181)
*Mustafa Sameen,Xiaojian Zhang,Xilei Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了SAPA框架，利用大语言模型合成理论驱动的潜在态度来预测网约车模式选择，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网约车模式选择模型预测精度有限，无法捕捉关键心理因素，且面临严重的类别不平衡问题（网约车出行仅占日常出行的很小比例）。

Method: SAPA采用分层方法：1）使用LLM从原始出行调查数据生成定性旅行者画像；2）训练倾向得分模型；3）LLM为理论驱动的潜在变量分配定量分数；4）最终分类器整合倾向得分、潜在变量分数和可观察的出行属性。

Result: 在大规模多年出行调查上的实验表明，SAPA显著优于最先进的基线方法，在测试集上的PR-AUC指标上提升了高达75.9%。

Conclusion: SAPA为准确预测网约车模式选择提供了强大工具，其方法学可轻松迁移到各种应用中。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of ridesourcing mode choices is essential for designing and
implementing effective traffic management policies for reducing congestion,
improving mobility, and allocating resources more efficiently. Existing models
for predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive
accuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are
further challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise
only a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting
Actions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict
ridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler
personas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model
on demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce
an individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to
theory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final
classifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their
interaction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode
choice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing
choice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set.
This study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode
choices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various
applications.

*Nursultan Askarbekuly,Timur Fayzrakhmanov,Sladjan Babarogić,Ivan Luković*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OBER是一个基于学习成果的教育推荐系统，通过将学习成果和评估项目直接嵌入数据模式，使任何推荐算法都能根据其促进学生掌握程度的效果进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数教育推荐系统仅基于点击率或评分进行优化和评估，无法衡量其真实的教学影响。需要一种能够直接评估推荐系统对学生学习成果影响的方法。

Method: OBER采用简约的实体关系模型、基于日志的掌握度计算公式和插件架构。在非正式学习领域的电子学习系统中进行了为期两周的随机分组测试，比较了三种方法：固定专家路径、协同过滤和基于知识的过滤。

Result: 协同过滤方法最大化了用户留存率，但固定路径方法实现了最高的掌握度。OBER可以从相同的日志数据中同时获取业务指标、相关性指标和学习指标。

Conclusion: OBER框架是方法无关的，可以轻松扩展到未来的自适应或情境感知推荐系统，让从业者能够在没有额外测试开销的情况下权衡相关性和参与度与成果掌握度之间的关系。

Abstract: Most educational recommender systems are tuned and judged on click- or
rating-based relevance, leaving their true pedagogical impact unclear. We
introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning
outcomes and assessment items directly into the data schema, so any algorithm
can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist
entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in
architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was
evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners
across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF),
and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path
achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and
learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and
engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The
framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or
context-aware recommenders.

### [253] [nDNA -- the Semantic Helix of Artificial Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18216)
*Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What
shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output?
Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent
geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic
representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic
geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and
indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals
the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which
quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational
transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the
semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations.
Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance,
found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural
drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not
just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.
  Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid--dynamics:
meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is
the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how
meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free
neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we
cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning,
alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between
checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and,
ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models,
diagnose risks, and govern change over time.

### [254] [Similarity Field Theory: A Mathematical Framework for Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18218)
*Kei-Sing Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了相似性场理论，这是一个数学框架，用于形式化实体间相似性关系及其演化的原则。该理论定义了相似性场、系统演化、概念纤维和生成算子，并基于此形式化地定义了智能的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者认为持久化和转换相似性关系构成了任何可理解动态系统的结构基础，需要建立一个数学框架来形式化相似性值及其演化的原则。

Method: 定义了相似性场S: U×U→[0,1]，满足自反性；系统演化序列Z_p=(X_p,S^(p))；概念K诱导的纤维F_α(K)；以及生成算子G。基于此框架形式化智能的定义。

Result: 证明了两个定理：(i)非对称性阻碍相互包含；(ii)稳定性需要锚定坐标或最终限制在f的水平集内。这些结果确保了相似性场演化的约束性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 相似性场理论为表征、比较和构建智能系统提供了基础语言，并可用于解释大语言模型和将其作为社会认知的实验探针。

Abstract: We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the
structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces
Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the
principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We
define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of
entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed
relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the
evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by
$p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers
$F_{\alpha}(K) = { E \in U \mid S(E,K) \ge \alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of
the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that
produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative
definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a
concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of
$K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field
Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and
constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks
mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or
eventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the
evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable,
culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large
language models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着慢性疾病负担增加和多模态临床数据的复杂性，需要统一的AI框架来主动预测个体健康风险。

Method: 采用分层堆叠的视觉-语言多模态Transformer架构，包含预训练、时间融合块和疾病本体图适配器三个关键创新模块。

Conclusion: VL-RiskFormer展示了在多模态临床数据上预测健康风险的有效性，为个性化医疗提供了有力工具。

Abstract: With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and
heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable
sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI
framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose
VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer
with a large language model (LLM) inference head embedded in its top layer. The
system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic
models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with
cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images,
fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives
using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion
block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer
decoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease
ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels
in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention
mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an
average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.

Method: 提出ChefMind混合架构：探索链(CoE)将模糊查询细化为结构化条件，知识图谱(KG)提供语义推理和可解释性，检索增强生成(RAG)补充上下文烹饪细节，大型语言模型(LLM)将输出整合为连贯推荐。

Result: 在Xiachufang数据集和手动标注查询上评估，ChefMind在准确性、相关性、完整性和清晰度方面表现优异，平均得分8.7，而消融模型为6.4-6.7。未处理查询降至1.6%，显示出处理模糊需求的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ChefMind通过混合架构有效解决了食谱推荐中的关键挑战，在多个评估指标上显著优于单一方法基线。

Abstract: Personalized recipe recommendation faces challenges in handling fuzzy user
intent, ensuring semantic accuracy, and providing sufficient detail coverage.
We propose ChefMind, a hybrid architecture combining Chain of Exploration
(CoE), Knowledge Graph (KG), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a Large
Language Model (LLM). CoE refines ambiguous queries into structured conditions,
KG offers semantic reasoning and interpretability, RAG supplements contextual
culinary details, and LLM integrates outputs into coherent recommendations. We
evaluate ChefMind on the Xiachufang dataset and manually annotated queries,
comparing it with LLM-only, KG-only, and RAG-only baselines. Results show that
ChefMind achieves superior performance in accuracy, relevance, completeness,
and clarity, with an average score of 8.7 versus 6.4-6.7 for ablation models.
Moreover, it reduces unprocessed queries to 1.6%, demonstrating robustness in
handling fuzzy demands.

### [257] [An N-Plus-1 GPT Agency for Critical Solution of Mechanical Engineering Analysis Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18229)
*Anthony Patera,Rohan Abeyaratne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种"N+1"GPT代理架构，用于机械工程问题的初步分析，通过多个独立求解代理和比较代理来提高GPT在工程问题求解中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPT在机械工程分析中虽然能产生优秀解决方案，但成功率仅85%，这种不可靠性使其不适合直接用于教育或工程实践。

Method: 采用N个独立的Solve代理生成解决方案，然后通过Compare代理比较和总结这些方案，基于Condorcet陪审团定理确保正确解的概率。

Result: 该方法能够显著提高问题求解的可靠性，特别是在问题陈述的成功概率大于1/2时，通过多数投票机制获得高概率的正确解。

Conclusion: 提出的多代理架构相比商业模型更注重透明度和教学价值，为GPT在工程教育中的可靠应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Generative AI, and specifically GPT, can produce a remarkable solution to a
mechanical engineering analysis problem - but also, on occasion, a flawed
solution. For example, an elementary mechanics problem is solved flawlessly in
one GPT instance and incorrectly in a subsequent GPT instance, with a success
probability of only 85%. This unreliability renders "out-of-the-box" GPT
unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice. We introduce an
"N-Plus-1" GPT Agency for Initial (Low-Cost) Analysis of mechanical engineering
Problem Statements. Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to
yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes
Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution
Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from
Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by
per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the
Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high
probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore,
Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare)
Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative
Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or
alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures. Comparisons to Grok Heavy, a
commercial multi-agent model, show similarities in design and performance, but
also important differences in emphasis: our Agency focuses on transparency and
pedagogical value.

*Zihan Dong,Xinyu Fan,Zixiang Tang,Yunqing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级分层强化学习框架ComputerAgent，用于桌面应用控制，相比现有多模态大语言模型方法，在保持性能的同时大幅减小模型规模和推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在桌面应用控制中存在推理延迟高、样本效率低、无法在设备上部署等问题，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层强化学习框架，将操作系统控制建模为两级选项过程（管理器和子策略），使用三模态状态编码器处理视觉和上下文多样性，集成元动作和早停机制减少无效交互。

Result: 在135个真实世界桌面任务测试中，简单任务成功率92.1%，困难任务成功率58.8%，性能匹配或超越200B参数MLLM基线，同时模型规模减小4个数量级，推理时间减半。

Conclusion: 分层强化学习为计算机控制提供了一种实用、可扩展的替代方案，优于基于单体MLLM的自动化方法。

Abstract: Controlling desktop applications via software remains a fundamental yet
under-served problem. Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest
screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but
they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on
long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We
introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework,
ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process
(manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task
ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates
meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and
uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device
inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks,
ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on
hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on
simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and
halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a
practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for
computer control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出当前医学AI基准测试存在严重问题，大型前沿模型虽然能在基准测试中获得高分，但实际上是通过测试技巧而非真正的医学理解，存在脆弱性和捷径学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示医学AI基准测试的局限性，证明高分数并不等同于真实医疗场景中的可靠性和实用性，呼吁关注模型的鲁棒性和真实医学需求对齐。

Method: 对6个旗舰模型在6个广泛使用的医学基准上进行压力测试，包括移除关键输入、改变提示词等方式，并通过临床医生指导的评估标准进行分析。

Result: 发现模型在基准测试中表现出明显的脆弱性：即使移除关键信息也能猜对答案，在微小提示变化下会改变答案，并产生看似合理但错误的推理过程。

Conclusion: 医学基准测试分数不能直接反映AI在真实医疗环境中的准备程度，需要更加关注模型的鲁棒性、合理推理能力以及与真实医学需求的匹配度。

Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical
benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often
guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers
under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning.
These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking
tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six
widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness
and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that
benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated
interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark
scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn
trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold
systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real
medical demands.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究通过推理长度约束和模型量化两种计算约束策略来降低推理模型的计算需求，并分析其对模型安全性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时计算扩展虽然能通过生成长链思维序列提高推理语言模型的性能，但计算成本显著增加。需要找到在保持性能的同时降低计算需求的方法。

Method: 1. 使用基于长度控制策略优化的强化学习方法微调推理模型，以满足用户定义的推理长度；2. 应用量化技术，在用户定义的计算约束下最大化链思维序列的生成。

Result: 论文研究了计算效率与模型安全性之间的权衡关系，但具体结果未在摘要中明确说明。

Conclusion: 计算约束策略（推理长度约束和模型量化）是降低推理模型计算需求的有效方法，同时需要平衡计算效率与模型安全性之间的关系。

Abstract: Test-time compute scaling has demonstrated the ability to improve the
performance of reasoning language models by generating longer chain-of-thought
(CoT) sequences. However, this increase in performance comes with a significant
increase in computational cost. In this work, we investigate two compute
constraint strategies: (1) reasoning length constraint and (2) model
quantization, as methods to reduce the compute demand of reasoning models and
study their impact on their safety performance. Specifically, we explore two
approaches to apply compute constraints to reasoning models: (1) fine-tuning
reasoning models using a length controlled policy optimization (LCPO) based
reinforcement learning method to satisfy a user-defined CoT reasoning length,
and (2) applying quantization to maximize the generation of CoT sequences
within a user-defined compute constraint. Furthermore, we study the trade-off
between the computational efficiency and the safety of the model.

*Moran Feldman,Amin Karbasi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Gödel测试，评估大型语言模型能否为简单未解数学猜想生成正确证明，并在组合优化领域的五个猜想上测试了GPT-5的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管前沿AI模型在中学和大学数学竞赛中表现出色，但尚不清楚它们是否能在更高级数学领域解决新的简单猜想。

Method: 设计Gödel测试，选取五个组合优化领域的未解猜想，向GPT-5提供相关论文但不告知具体猜想，详细评估其推理过程。

Result: GPT-5在三个较简单问题上给出接近正确的解，甚至在一个问题上推翻了原猜想并给出有效解；但在需要跨论文综合的问题上失败，在无验证猜想的难题上分析失败。

Conclusion: GPT-5在常规推理上有显著进步，偶尔展现原创性，但在跨论文综合方面存在明显局限，可能是通过Gödel测试的早期步骤。

Abstract: Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong
results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains
unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more
advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether
a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved
conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures
in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source
papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then
assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5
produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different
approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while
providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required
combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a
validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but
failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected.
Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on
routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations
when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step
toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.

### [262] [ATLAS: Benchmarking and Adapting LLMs for Global Trade via Harmonized Tariff Code Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18400)
*Pritish Yuvraj,Siva Devarakonda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个HTS代码分类基准，通过微调Atlas模型（LLaMA-3.3-70B）在10位分类上达到40%准确率，比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5分别提升15和27.5个百分点，且成本显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTS代码分类是全球贸易中的关键瓶颈，但机器学习社区对此关注不足。错误分类可能导致货物运输完全停滞，主要邮政运营商因海关文件不完整而暂停向美国发货。

Method: 基于美国海关在线搜索系统（CROSS）创建首个HTS代码分类基准，微调Atlas模型（LLaMA-3.3-70B）进行10位和6位HTS代码分类。

Result: 微调后的Atlas模型在10位分类上达到40%准确率，6位分类达到57.5%准确率，比GPT-5-Thinking和Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking分别提升15和27.5个百分点，成本降低5-8倍。

Conclusion: Atlas模型为HTS分类设立了强基线，但基准仍具挑战性。通过发布数据集和模型，旨在将HTS分类定位为新的社区基准任务，促进检索、推理和对齐方面的未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate classification of products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) is a critical bottleneck in global trade, yet it has received little
attention from the machine learning community. Misclassification can halt
shipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the
U.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark
for HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online
Search System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned
Atlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit
classifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements
of 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking.
Beyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and
eight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to
guarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While
Atlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with
only 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim
to position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite
future work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment.

### [263] [Instruction-Following Evaluation in Function Calling for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18420)
*Nikolai Skripko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IFEval-FC是一个新的函数调用基准测试，专门评估LLM在函数调用中遵循参数格式指令的能力，弥补了现有基准只测试参数正确性而不测试格式遵循的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有函数调用基准（如BFCL、tau^2-Bench、ACEBench）只评估参数正确性，但忽略了格式指令遵循，这对实际AI代理系统很重要。

Method: 基于IFEval设计，在JSON schema描述中直接编码可验证的格式要求（如不含标点符号），包含750个测试用例，每个用例包含带格式要求的函数和用户查询，采用全自动算法评估。

Result: 即使是GPT-5和Claude 4.1 Opus等最先进的专有模型也经常无法遵循基本格式规则，揭示了实际代理系统的局限性。

Conclusion: IFEval-FC填补了函数调用评估的重要空白，代码和数据已开源，有助于推动更可靠的AI代理系统发展。

Abstract: Function calling is a core capability of large language models, essential for
AI agents. Existing benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), tau^2-Bench (arXiv:2506.07982), and ACEBench
(arXiv:2501.12851) evaluate argument correctness but do not test adherence to
format instructions embedded in parameter descriptions, such as enclosing
values in double quotes or using ISO date formats.
  We introduce IFEval-FC, a benchmark inspired by IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911)
that assesses precise instruction following in function calling. IFEval-FC
encodes verifiable formats directly within JSON schema descriptions, for
example specifying that a value must not contain punctuation. It includes 750
test cases, each consisting of a function with an embedded format for one of
its input parameters and a corresponding user query. Evaluation is fully
algorithmic, ensuring objectivity, reproducibility, and scalability.
  Our results show that even state-of-the-art proprietary models, including
GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 Opus, frequently fail to follow basic formatting rules,
highlighting a practical limitation for real-world agent systems. The complete
codebase and data are publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型能否从数学可解释的推荐模型中生成有效的用户面向解释，通过用户研究评估不同解释策略的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI研究多依赖自动评估指标，但这些指标往往无法捕捉用户的真实需求和感知，因此需要采用用户中心的方法来评估解释质量。

Method: 基于约束矩阵分解的可解释推荐模型，通过精心设计的LLM提示将模型结构转化为自然语言解释，并对326名参与者进行用户研究，评估五种关键维度的解释质量。

Result: 所有解释类型都得到了良好接受，不同策略之间存在中等统计差异，用户评论提供了定量结果之外的补充见解。

Conclusion: LLM能够从可解释推荐模型中生成有效的用户面向解释，用户中心评估方法为解释质量提供了更全面的理解。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective,
user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation
model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types
are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as
observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted
scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural
language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in
explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to
capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a
user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed
the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency,
effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the
recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are
perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying
model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals
that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate
statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore
how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary
insights beyond the quantitative results.

Result: 在构建的多模态基准测试中，Pensieve相比最先进方法在QA准确率上提升高达14%

Conclusion: Memory-QA任务具有现实挑战性，Pensieve方法通过综合管道设计有效解决了记忆创建、时空利用和多记忆推理等关键问题

Abstract: We introduce Memory-QA, a novel real-world task that involves answering
recall questions about visual content from previously stored multimodal
memories. This task poses unique challenges, including the creation of
task-oriented memories, the effective utilization of temporal and location
information within memories, and the ability to draw upon multiple memories to
answer a recall question. To address these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive pipeline, Pensieve, integrating memory-specific augmentation,
time- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA
fine-tuning. We created a multimodal benchmark to illustrate various real
challenges in this task, and show the superior performance of Pensieve over
state-of-the-art solutions (up to 14% on QA accuracy).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 击剑运动在裁判方面面临主观判罚、人为错误、偏见以及在练习环境中裁判资源有限等挑战，需要自动化裁判辅助系统。

Method: 系统从视频中提取2D关节位置，进行归一化处理，计算101维运动学特征，使用Transformer进行多标签动作分类，并结合基于规则的推理来确定优先权和得分。

Result: 在有限的手动标注数据下，5折交叉验证的平均macro-F1得分为0.549，优于多个基线模型（TCN、BiLSTM和普通Transformer）。

Conclusion: 虽然尚未达到部署水平，但结果表明这是实现击剑自动化裁判辅助的有前途路径，并为AI在击剑领域的应用（如教练）开辟了新机会。

Abstract: The sport of fencing, like many other sports, faces challenges in refereeing:
subjective calls, human errors, bias, and limited availability in practice
environments. We present FERA (Fencing Referee Assistant), a prototype AI
referee for foil fencing which integrates pose-based multi-label action
recognition and rule-based reasoning. FERA extracts 2D joint positions from
video, normalizes them, computes a 101-dimensional kinematic feature set, and
applies a Transformer for multi-label move and blade classification. To
determine priority and scoring, FERA applies a distilled language model with
encoded right-of-way rules, producing both a decision and an explanation for
each exchange. With limited hand-labeled data, a 5-fold cross-validation
achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.549, outperforming multiple baselines,
including a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BiLSTM, and a vanilla
Transformer. While not ready for deployment, these results demonstrate a
promising path towards automated referee assistance in foil fencing and new
opportunities for AI applications, such as coaching in the field of fencing.

TL;DR: LLMZ+是一种基于提示白名单的防御机制，通过只允许上下文适当的消息与智能LLM交互来增强安全性，相比传统检测方法能更有效地防御越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能AI相比传统模型具有更高的安全风险，因为它们拥有对数据源和API工具的特权访问，且依赖AI的非确定性行为。现有的检测恶意意图的防御机制不足以应对这些风险。

Method: 提出LLMZ+方法，采用提示白名单机制，只允许符合预定义用例和操作边界的上下文适当消息与智能LLM进行交互。

Result: 实证评估显示LLMZ+对常见越狱提示具有强韧性，同时不影响合法业务通信。在实验环境中，误报率和漏报率均可降至0。

Conclusion: LLMZ+通过基于上下文的特异性保证安全性，简化了安全框架，增强了长期韧性，并减少了维持LLM信息安全所需的资源。

Abstract: Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable
target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data
sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical
agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone
(DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI
(only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This
characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational
security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely
on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent,
thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this
paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond
traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting.
Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are
permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of
context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM
conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach
streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and
reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against
the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business
communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly
between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach
using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to
0 in our experimental setting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合LLM和外部符号方程求解器的新方法，通过分解问题生成方程、使用外部求解器计算答案，并采用二次验证和迭代修正机制来提高数学应用题求解的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在解决数学应用题时存在困难，因为这类问题需要复杂的推理和数学能力。虽然现有研究通过改进提示词取得了一定进展，但仍需要更可靠的方法来确保答案的正确性。

Method: 1. 首先提示LLM将问题分解并生成方程；2. 使用外部符号方程求解器计算答案；3. 再次提示LLM估算正确答案；4. 比较估算值与计算结果进行验证；5. 如果验证失败，采用迭代修正过程直到找到正确答案。

Result: 该方法在数值和代数数学应用题数据集上达到了新的最先进水平，比之前的最佳结果平均提高了近2%。在三角函数应用题上也取得了令人满意的结果，这是之前未被尝试过的任务。

Conclusion: 提出的结合LLM和外部求解器的方法有效提升了数学应用题的求解准确性，特别是通过二次验证和迭代修正机制确保了答案的可靠性。该方法还引入了两个新数据集来进一步测试LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including
problem-solving and question-answering. However, LLMs often find Math Word
Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning
and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts
have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study
proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from
a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic
equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained
answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is
instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of
estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is
then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an
iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is
eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on
datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs,
improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In
addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a
task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge. This study also
introduces two new datasets, SVAMPClean and Trig300, to further advance the
testing of LLMs' reasoning abilities.

<details>

Motivation: 气候风险评估需要模拟空间异质性灾害与适应性经济系统之间的复杂相互作用，现有模型难以捕捉这些动态过程。

Method: 开发了基于Mesa的地理空间代理模型，整合CLIMADA气候影响评估数据，引入进化学习机制让企业通过适应性选择和突变演化预算分配、定价、工资和风险适应策略。

Result: 使用RCP8.5情景下的河流洪水预测到2100年，进化适应使企业能够在数十年气候压力干扰后恢复到基线生产水平；未直接暴露于洪水的代理人也因供应链中断受到影响，世纪末商品平均价格比基线高5.6%。

Conclusion: 该开源框架为金融机构和公司提供了量化直接和级联气候风险的工具，同时评估成本效益适应的策略。

Abstract: Climate risk assessment requires modelling complex interactions between
spatially heterogeneous hazards and adaptive economic systems. We present a
novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with
evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines Mesa-based
spatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive
learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget
allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection
and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections
under RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to
converge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of
disruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even
agents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply
chain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher
under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline. This open-source framework provides
financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and
cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TERAG是一个低成本图检索增强生成框架，通过个性化PageRank在检索阶段构建信息图，仅用3%-11%的token消耗达到主流图RAG方法80%以上的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图RAG系统忽视了LLM token使用的高成本，阻碍了大规模应用，需要开发更经济的解决方案

Method: 结合HippoRAG思想，在检索阶段引入个性化PageRank(PPR)来构建信息图，显著降低图构建成本

Result: TERAG仅消耗3%-11%的输出token，但能达到广泛使用的图RAG方法至少80%的准确率

Conclusion: TERAG证明了在显著降低计算成本的同时，仍能保持图RAG系统良好性能的可行性

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely studied
approach for improving the reasoning, accuracy, and factuality of Large
Language Models. However, many existing graph-based RAG systems overlook the
high cost associated with LLM token usage during graph construction, hindering
large-scale adoption. To address this, we propose TERAG, a simple yet effective
framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost.
Inspired by HippoRAG, we incorporate Personalized PageRank (PPR) during the
retrieval phase, and we achieve at least 80% of the accuracy of widely used
graph-based RAG methods while consuming only 3%-11% of the output tokens.

TL;DR: 该论文澄清了机器学习模型与其明确描述（MLMD）之间的区别，并细化了语义保持的概念，以确保模型准确复制。通过工业用例验证了方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在航空系统中的应用增加，需要确保ML系统的安全运行并符合监管要求。EASA和EUROCAE/SAE已发布相关指导文件，但需要更具体的方法来实现这些目标。

Method: 论文提出了机器学习模型描述（MLMD）的概念，并细化了语义保持的核心理念。通过多个工业用例来构建和比较不同的目标模型，验证方法的有效性。

Result: 通过工业用例验证，证明了MLMD方法能够确保机器学习模型在目标环境中准确复制其训练性能，满足航空安全监管要求。

Conclusion: MLMD和语义保持概念为机器学习模型在安全关键航空系统中的合规开发提供了实用框架，有助于实现EASA和EUROCAE/SAE指南中的安全目标。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) may offer new capabilities in airborne systems.
However, as any piece of airborne systems, ML-based systems will be required to
guarantee their safe operation. Thus, their development will have to be
demonstrated to be compliant with the adequate guidance. So far, the European
Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published a concept paper and an
EUROCAE/SAE group is preparing ED-324. Both approaches delineate high-level
objectives to confirm the ML model achieves its intended function and maintains
training performance in the target environment. The paper aims to clarify the
difference between an ML model and its corresponding unambiguous description,
referred to as the Machine Learning Model Description (MLMD). It then refines
the essential notion of semantics preservation to ensure the accurate
replication of the model. We apply our contributions to several industrial use
cases to build and compare several target models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DataAgents是结合LLM推理与任务分解、行动推理和工具调用的自主数据代理，能够将复杂非结构化数据转化为可操作知识，代表了数据到知识系统的范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据规模和复杂性增长，数据准备、转换和分析工作仍然劳动密集、重复且难以扩展。数据与AI的对齐至关重要，但数据往往不适合AI直接利用。

Method: DataAgents通过集成LLM推理、任务分解、行动推理和工具调用，能够自主解释数据任务描述，将任务分解为子任务，推理行动，将行动转化为Python代码或工具调用，并执行操作。

Result: DataAgents能够处理数据收集、集成、预处理、选择、转换、重加权、增强、重编程、修复和检索等多种数据操作任务。

Conclusion: 需要协同努力推进行动工作流优化，建立开放数据集和基准生态系统，保护隐私，平衡效率与可扩展性，并开发可信的DataAgent防护机制以防止恶意行为。

Abstract: As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming,
and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale.
Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment
between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways
that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises:
how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations?
Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task
decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can
autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks,
reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and
execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools,
DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to
diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a
paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are
capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection,
transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and
retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and
unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why
the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a
critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their
architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and
capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance
action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems,
safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy
DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.

TL;DR: 提出经验扩展框架，通过自主环境交互和协作经验共享实现LLM的持续进化，超越静态人类生成数据的限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通过扩大模型规模、训练数据和计算能力的方法已接近饱和，人类生成文本资源耗尽，进一步增益减少

Method: 经验扩展框架：捕获原始交互、提炼为紧凑可重用知识、定期优化存储内容以保持相关性和效率

Result: 在模拟真实场景中验证，包括泛化到未见但相关任务、重复查询和过饱和知识存储，在所有设置中提高准确性并维持性能

Conclusion: 结构化部署后学习可以扩展LLM能力，为持续智能进步提供可扩展路径

Abstract: Scaling model size, training data, and compute power have driven advances in
large language models (LLMs), but these approaches are reaching saturation as
human-generated text is exhausted and further gains diminish. We propose
experience scaling, a framework for continuous post-deployment evolution for
LLMs through autonomous interaction with the environment and collaborative
sharing of accumulated experience. The framework captures raw interactions,
distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored
content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in
simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen
but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores.
Across all settings, experience scaling improves accuracy, sustains performance
over time, and maintains gains when applied to novel situations. These results
demonstrate that structured post-deployment learning can extend LLM
capabilities beyond the limits of static human-generated data, offering a
scalable path for continued intelligence progress.

Motivation: 解决异构多代理系统中代理能力发现和验证的挑战，提供高效、可验证的代理发现机制。

Method: 基于Open Agentic Schema Framework构建，采用两级映射的Kademlia分布式哈希表，复用OCI/ORAS基础设施进行工件分发，集成Sigstore用于来源验证，支持模式驱动的可扩展性。

Result: 提出了一个可验证、高效的代理发现架构，支持多种新兴代理模式（LLM提示代理、MCP服务器、A2A组件）。

Conclusion: ADS为新兴代理注册和互操作性计划提供了重要的架构模型，具有安全性和性能优势。

Abstract: The Agent Directory Service (ADS) is a distributed directory for the
discovery of AI agent capabilities, metadata, and provenance. It leverages
content-addressed storage, hierarchical taxonomies, and cryptographic signing
to enable efficient, verifiable, and multi-dimensional discovery across
heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Built on the Open Agentic Schema
Framework (OASF), ADS decouples capability indexing from content location
through a two-level mapping realized over a Kademlia-based Distributed Hash
Table (DHT). It reuses mature OCI / ORAS infrastructure for artifact
distribution, integrates Sigstore for provenance, and supports schema-driven
extensibility for emerging agent modalities (LLM prompt agents, MCP servers,
A2A-enabled components). This paper formalizes the architectural model,
describes storage and discovery layers, explains security and performance
properties, and positions ADS within the broader landscape of emerging agent
registry and interoperability initiatives.

*Dennis Gross,Helge Spieker,Arnaud Gotlieb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMCHECKER是一种基于模型检查的验证方法，用于验证LLM文本生成过程的概率计算树逻辑（PCTL）属性。该方法通过α-k有界文本生成来限制生成空间，并支持多种文本量化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本生成过程缺乏形式化验证方法，无法确保生成文本的一致性和可靠性。需要一种系统性的方法来验证LLM生成过程的逻辑属性。

Method: 提出α-k有界文本生成方法，在每个生成步骤中只考虑累积概率最高的前k个token，并通过阈值α进一步筛选。基于此构建有限状态模型进行PCTL模型检查。

Result: 在多个LLM模型（Llama、Gemma、Mistral等）上验证了方法的适用性，能够有效验证文本生成过程的PCTL属性。

Conclusion: 这是首次将PCTL模型检查应用于LLM文本生成过程验证，为LLM的形式化验证提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification
method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of
an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number
of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the
same. This insight drives the creation of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded text generation,
narrowing the focus to the $\alpha$ maximal cumulative probability on the
top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification
method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while
accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text
quality and biases. The threshold $\alpha$ further reduces the selected tokens,
only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability.
LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of
$\alpha$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in
several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our
knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to
check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个模块化框架用于ICD-10-CM编码预测，通过系统化模型选择、冗余感知数据采样和结构化输入设计，提升大型语言模型在医疗编码任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICD编码是临床文档、计费和分析的关键任务，但当前仍依赖人工且容易出错。虽然大型语言模型在自动化ICD编码方面有潜力，但在基础模型选择、输入上下文化和训练数据冗余方面存在挑战。

Method: 开发模块化框架，包括：1）使用LLM-as-judge评估协议和Plackett-Luce聚合来选择和排名开源LLM；2）引入嵌入相似性度量和冗余感知采样策略；3）利用台湾医院的结构化出院摘要评估上下文效果；4）比较通用和特定章节建模范式。

Result: 在两个机构数据集上的实验表明，经过微调的选择模型在内部和外部评估中始终优于基线LLM。包含更多临床章节能持续提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究使用开源LLM建立了实用且原则性的ICD-10-CM编码预测方法，通过结合知情模型选择、高效数据精炼和上下文感知提示，为自动化医疗编码系统的实际部署提供了可扩展的机构就绪解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is critical
for clinical documentation, billing, and healthcare analytics, yet it remains a
labour-intensive and error-prone task. Although large language models (LLMs)
show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model
selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their
effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification
(ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled
model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design.
The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce
aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic
comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based
similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove
semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge
summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine
section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling
paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the
selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in
internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections
consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs
to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for
real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed
model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为混合优势策略优化（MAPO）的新方法，解决了GRPO中存在的优势反转和优势镜像问题，通过动态重加权优势函数来适应不同轨迹确定性的样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法在优势函数分配上存在优势反转和优势镜像问题，阻碍了不同查询样本间的合理优势分配，需要一种更有效的策略来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MAPO方法，引入优势百分比偏差来处理高确定性轨迹样本，并动态重加权优势函数以适应不同轨迹确定性的样本特征。

Result: 通过与相关最先进方法的比较以及对不同优势变体的消融研究，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPO是一种简单但有效的GRPO策略，能够合理配置优势函数以考虑样本特定特征，显著提升基础模型在推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the
performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage
function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory
importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion
and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation
across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective
GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the
trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent
deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we
dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory
certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for
sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art
methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates
the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户画像作为用户理解的核心技术面临缺乏全面基准的问题，且由于大规模真实标签收集困难以及异构噪声数据影响LLM可靠性，需要开发标签无关的可靠用户画像方法。

Method: 提出Conf-Profile框架：1）利用高级LLM合成高质量标签，通过置信度加权投票和校准；2）将多维度结果蒸馏到轻量LLM；3）通过置信度引导的无监督强化学习增强推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明Conf-Profile通过两阶段训练显著提升性能，在Qwen3-8B模型上F1分数提高了13.97。

Conclusion: Conf-Profile框架有效解决了用户画像中的标签稀缺和可靠性问题，为LLM在用户理解任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: User profiling, as a core technique for user understanding, aims to infer
structural attributes from user information. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by
the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform,
encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy.
However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of
collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy
user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free
and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning
framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize
high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed
by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence
calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results,
rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a
lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided
unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty
filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental
results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through
the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的LLM记忆定义和四部分分类法（参数化、上下文、外部、程序性/情景性），建立了记忆四元组框架，并开发了分层评估协议和DMM Gov治理系统，为LLM记忆研究提供了可复现、可比较和可治理的坐标系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM记忆研究缺乏统一的定义、分类和评估标准，导致跨异构设置的比较失真。需要建立一个系统框架来统一记忆的机制、评估和治理。

Method: 提出记忆四元组（位置、持久性、写入/访问路径、可控性），采用三设置协议（仅参数化、离线检索、在线检索）解耦能力与信息可用性，建立分层评估体系，并开发DMM Gov更新和遗忘协调系统。

Result: 构建了一个包含时间治理和泄漏审计的完整框架，支持不确定性报告，并提出了四个可测试的命题，为LLM记忆研究提供了系统的方法论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM记忆研究创建了一个可复现、可比较和可治理的坐标系，有助于推动该领域的标准化发展和实际部署应用。

Abstract: Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent
state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be
addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy
(parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple
(location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism,
evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To
avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a
three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval)
that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and
timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book
recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves
and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet
attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency
and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and
leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and
uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with
multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM
Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC),
and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout,
monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict
handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable
propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally
constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with
small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a
reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and
deployment.

Abstract: We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter
open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities
are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with
long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale
Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start
training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and
equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning.
Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples
optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and
subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly
Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic
ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL
framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over
synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result,
LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional
efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5%
(from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We
release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems

Abstract: Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) is a core human cognitive ability and a
critical requirement for advancing embodied intelligence and autonomous
systems. Despite recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving
human-level VSR remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
representing and reasoning over three-dimensional space. In this paper, we
present a systematic investigation of VSR in VLMs, encompassing a review of
existing methodologies across input modalities, model architectures, training
strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, we categorize spatial
intelligence into three levels of capability, ie, basic perception, spatial
understanding, spatial planning, and curate SIBench, a spatial intelligence
benchmark encompassing nearly 20 open-source datasets across 23 task settings.
Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a pronounced gap between
perception and reasoning, as models show competence in basic perceptual tasks
but consistently underperform in understanding and planning tasks, particularly
in numerical estimation, multi-view reasoning, temporal dynamics, and spatial
imagination. These findings underscore the substantial challenges that remain
in achieving spatial intelligence, while providing both a systematic roadmap
and a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in the field. The

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the
critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific
tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible.
Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing
models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications.
However, con- ventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting
and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes DEAL, a novel framework that
integrates Low-Rank Adapta- tion (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy.
By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the
framework mitigates the lim- itations of existing FT methods while maintaining
efficiency in privacy-preserving settings. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets
show that DEAL consistently outper- forms baseline methods, yielding
substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in
LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

Abstract: Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like
cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being
deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education,
scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable
potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which
can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the
overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep
understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based
agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of
hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete
workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types
of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct
an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence
of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of
existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and
detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this
survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in
LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and
reliable agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性流程监控旨在预测正在进行的流程执行的未来，其中剩余时间预测是一个常见目标。本文旨在在实际物流公司的出库仓库流程中比较不同剩余时间预测方法的性能。

Method: 在物流公司航空业务的真实出库仓库流程中，比较了四种剩余时间预测方法。使用了包含169,523条轨迹的原始事件日志进行实验。

Result: 深度学习模型实现了最高的预测精度，但浅层方法（如传统提升技术）在精度上具有竞争力，且计算资源需求显著更少。

Conclusion: 虽然深度学习在剩余时间预测方面表现最佳，但浅层方法在精度和计算效率之间提供了更好的平衡，对于资源受限的实际应用场景具有重要价值。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring is a sub-domain of process mining which aims to
forecast the future of ongoing process executions. One common prediction target
is the remaining time, meaning the time that will elapse until a process
execution is completed. In this paper, we compare four different remaining time
prediction approaches in a real-life outbound warehouse process of a logistics
company in the aviation business. For this process, the company provided us
with a novel and original event log with 169,523 traces, which we can make
publicly available. Unsurprisingly, we find that deep learning models achieve
the highest accuracy, but shallow methods like conventional boosting techniques
achieve competitive accuracy and require significantly fewer computational
resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序生成内容的算法评估难以找到与人类体验一致的指标，特别是对于复合构件。自动分解作为一种可能的解决方案需要满足一系列属性的概念。

Method: 借鉴游戏研究和游戏AI研究，引入了地标、纪念碑和信标等嵌套概念，这些概念基于构件的可感知性、唤起性和行动召唤，均从玩家中心视角出发。

Result: 这些概念具有游戏通用性，可跨类型使用，并且可以使用当前研究和工业中使用的技术来发现和评估这些实体，为完全自动化的PCG分解和重要子组件评估开辟了道路。

Conclusion: 该方法旨在建立人文学科与技术游戏研究之间的联系，实现更好的计算PCG评估，虽然重点强调混合主动PCG和组合PCG，但相信其应用范围超出这些领域。

Abstract: Algorithmic evaluation of procedurally generated content struggles to find
metrics that align with human experience, particularly for composite artefacts.
Automatic decomposition as a possible solution requires concepts that meet a
range of properties. To this end, drawing on Games Studies and Game AI
research, we introduce the nested concepts of \textit{Landmarks},
\textit{Monuments}, and \textit{Beacons}. These concepts are based on the
artefact's perceivability, evocativeness, and Call to Action, all from a
player-centric perspective. These terms are generic to games and usable across
genres. We argue that these entities can be found and evaluated with techniques
currently used in both research and industry, opening a path towards a fully
automated decomposition of PCG, and evaluation of the salient sub-components.
Although the work presented here emphasises mixed-initiative PCG and
compositional PCG, we believe it applies beyond those domains. With this
approach, we intend to create a connection between humanities and technical
game research and allow for better computational PCG evaluation

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了当前方法的边界，通过利用可观测源作为辅助变量改进了因果表示学习的识别能力。

Abstract: Causal representation learning seeks to recover latent factors that generate
observational data through a mixing function. Needing assumptions on latent
structures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works
often build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables.
However, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external
to the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can
be easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating
identification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources
being auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables. Our main
results show that one can identify entire latent variables up to subspace-wise
transformations and permutations using volume-preserving encoders. Moreover,
when multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a
variable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the
latent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on synthetic
graph and image data, thereby extending the boundaries of current approaches.

Motivation: 现有LLM规划方法依赖频繁查询和环境反馈，导致高查询成本且难以实现长期奖励对齐。

Method: 使用LLM生成多样化高级规划程序，通过领域自适应批评器评估候选计划并选择最优方案。

Result: 在ALFWorld、NetHack和StarCraft II实验中，CoPiC相比AdaPlanner和Reflexion平均提升23.33%成功率，减少91.27%查询成本。

Conclusion: CoPiC通过程序化规划和领域自适应评估，有效解决了LLM规划中的查询成本高和长期奖励对齐问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI
agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world
knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and
environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address
this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine
plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query
costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental
feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards.
We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of
relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of
high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate
plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and
selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using
high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as
estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs.
Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC
outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving
an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in
query costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAS初始化方法未能充分考虑后续阶段智能体之间的协作需求，需要一种能够优化智能体团队结构的初始化方法。

Method: 提出AgentInit方法，包含多轮智能体交互与反思、自然语言到格式的转换机制，以及基于帕累托原则的平衡团队选择策略，共同考虑智能体团队多样性和任务相关性。

Result: 实验表明AgentInit在各种框架和任务中均优于现有初始化方法和预定义策略，整体性能提升分别达1.2和1.6倍，同时显著减少token消耗。

Conclusion: AgentInit具有良好的可迁移性，关键组件有效性得到验证，证明其作为可靠MAS初始化方法的能力和适应性。

Abstract: Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent
systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's
efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do
not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in
subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we
propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams.
Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between
agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to
Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team
selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to
jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective
and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments
show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization
methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks,
achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6,
respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further
analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the
effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and
adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method. Source code and models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在西方中心偏见，限制了其在多元文化背景下的有效性。虽然已有研究探索文化对齐，但跨文化迁移（利用一种文化的对齐来提升其他文化性能）仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用覆盖13个阿拉伯国家的文化基础常识推理数据集，评估轻量级对齐方法（上下文学习、演示强化DITTO）以及监督微调和直接偏好优化基线。

Result: 结果显示，仅需来自一个国家的12个文化特定示例就能在多语言模型中平均提升其他国家的性能10%。来自印尼和美国的跨文化演示在MCQ推理中也能达到或超越文化内对齐效果。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明高效的跨文化对齐是可行的，为将LLMs适应低资源文化环境提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting
their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has
explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using
alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains
underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense
reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities
coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded
commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate
lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and
demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised
fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12
culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by
10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that
out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or
surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural
commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate
that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising
approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

Motivation: 研究素数分布的双重特性——定义上的确定性却表现出类似随机过程的统计行为，探索机器学习作为数论实验工具的可能性

Method: 使用图像聚焦的机器学习模型，在Ulam螺旋的不同区域提取数据块进行训练和比较分析

Result: 在500m区域训练的模型准确率优于25m区域训练的模型，表明前者存在更易学习的规律；不同区域的分类策略也不同，低数值区域更关注识别素数模式，高数值区域更注重排除合数

Conclusion: 机器学习可作为数论研究的新实验工具，特别是在研究强素数和弱素数模式以用于密码学目的方面具有潜力

Abstract: Research on the distribution of prime numbers has revealed a dual character:
deterministic in definition yet exhibiting statistical behavior reminiscent of
random processes. In this paper we show that it is possible to use an
image-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of
prime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we
demonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted
from regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on
blocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This
implies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in
the latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem
to imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in
different regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at
lower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns
with number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we
should see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages
(density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness
regularises after scaling by log x. Taken together, these findings point toward
an interesting possibility: that machine learning can serve as a new
experimental instrument for number theory. Notably, the method shows potential
1 for investigating the patterns in strong and weak primes for cryptographic
purposes.

Abstract: In the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), marketplaces have become
essential platforms for facilitating the exchange of data products to foster
data sharing. Model transactions provide economic solutions in data
marketplaces that enhance data reusability and ensure the traceability of data
ownership. To establish trustworthy data marketplaces, Federated Learning (FL)
has emerged as a promising paradigm to enable collaborative learning across
siloed datasets while safeguarding data privacy. However, effective data
valuation and selection from heterogeneous sources in the FL setup remain key
challenges. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework centered on a
Wasserstein-based estimator tailored for FL. The estimator not only predicts
model performance across unseen data combinations but also reveals the
compatibility between data heterogeneity and FL aggregation algorithms. To
ensure privacy, we propose a distributed method to approximate Wasserstein
distance without requiring access to raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
model performance can be reliably extrapolated under the neural scaling law,
enabling effective data selection without full-scale training. Extensive
experiments across diverse scenarios, such as label skew, mislabeled, and
unlabeled sources, show that our approach consistently identifies
high-performing data combinations, paving the way for more reliable FL-based
model marketplaces.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (CFL) enables organizations (e.g., hospitals or
banks) to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while
preserving data privacy by keeping data local. While prior work has primarily
addressed statistical heterogeneity across organizations, a critical challenge
arises from economic competition, where organizations may act as market rivals,
making them hesitant to participate in joint training due to potential utility
loss (i.e., reduced net benefit). Furthermore, the combined effects of
statistical heterogeneity and inter-organizational competition on
organizational behavior and system-wide social welfare remain underexplored. In
this paper, we propose CoCoGen, a coopetitive-compatible data generation
framework, leveraging generative AI (GenAI) and potential game theory to model,
analyze, and optimize collaborative learning under heterogeneous and
competitive settings. Specifically, CoCoGen characterizes competition and
statistical heterogeneity through learning performance and utility-based
formulations and models each training round as a weighted potential game. We
then derive GenAI-based data generation strategies that maximize social
welfare. Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST dataset reveal how varying
heterogeneity and competition levels affect organizational behavior and
demonstrate that CoCoGen consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Method: 使用单级测试平台，比较完全学习的NODE和保持守恒结构的UDE方法，在三种需求机制下进行训练和评估

Result: 在AR(1)和高斯需求下，UDE显著优于NODE；在重尾对数正态需求下，NODE更灵活表现更好

Conclusion: 当噪声轻尾或时间相关时应强制结构约束，当极端事件主导时应放松结构约束

Abstract: We study learning of continuous-time inventory dynamics under stochastic
demand and quantify when structure helps or hurts forecasting of the bullwhip
effect. BULL-ODE compares a fully learned Neural ODE (NODE) that models the
entire right-hand side against a physics-informed Universal Differential
Equation (UDE) that preserves conservation and order-up-to structure while
learning a small residual policy term. Classical supply chain models explain
the bullwhip through control/forecasting choices and information sharing, while
recent physics-informed and neural differential equation methods blend domain
constraints with learned components. It is unclear whether structural bias
helps or hinders forecasting under different demand regimes. We address this by
using a single-echelon testbed with three demand regimes - AR(1)
(autocorrelated), i.i.d. Gaussian, and heavy-tailed lognormal. Training is done
on varying fractions of each trajectory, followed by evaluation of multi-step
forecasts for inventory I, order rate O, and demand D. Across the structured
regimes, UDE consistently generalizes better: with 90% of the training horizon,
inventory RMSE drops from 4.92 (NODE) to 0.26 (UDE) under AR(1) and from 5.96
to 0.95 under Gaussian demand. Under heavy-tailed lognormal shocks, the
flexibility of NODE is better. These trends persist as train18 ing data
shrinks, with NODE exhibiting phase drift in extrapolation while UDE remains
stable but underreacts to rare spikes. Our results provide concrete guidance:
enforce structure when noise is light-tailed or temporally correlated; relax
structure when extreme events dominate. Beyond inventory control, the results
offer guidance for hybrid modeling in scientific and engineering systems:
enforce known structure when conservation laws and modest noise dominate, and
relax structure to capture extremes in settings where rare events drive
dynamics.

Abstract: The growing use of permanent monitoring systems has increased data
availability, offering new opportunities for structural assessment but also
posing scalability challenges, especially across large bridge networks.
Managing multiple structures requires tracking and comparing long-term
behaviour efficiently. To address this, knowledge transfer between similar
structures becomes essential. This study proposes a model-based transfer
learning approach using neural network surrogate models, enabling a model
trained on one bridge to be adapted to another with similar characteristics.
These models capture shared damage mechanisms, supporting a scalable and
generalizable monitoring framework. The method was validated using real data
from two bridges. The transferred model was integrated into a Bayesian
inference framework for continuous damage assessment based on modal features
from monitoring data. Results showed high sensitivity to damage location,
severity, and extent. This approach enhances real-time monitoring and enables
cross-structure knowledge transfer, promoting smart monitoring strategies and

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖预定义的单尺度补丁或缺乏有效的多尺度特征融合机制，无法充分捕捉时间序列中的复杂模式，导致性能受限和泛化能力不足。

Method: AdaMixT引入多种补丁，利用通用预训练模型和领域特定模型进行多尺度特征提取，通过门控网络动态分配不同专家的权重，实现自适应多尺度融合。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的基准数据集上的综合实验表明，AdaMixT在真实场景中具有显著的有效性。

Conclusion: AdaMixT通过自适应多尺度特征融合机制，在多元时间序列预测任务中表现出优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting involves predicting future values based
on historical observations. However, existing approaches primarily rely on
predefined single-scale patches or lack effective mechanisms for multi-scale
feature fusion. These limitations hinder them from fully capturing the complex
patterns inherent in time series, leading to constrained performance and
insufficient generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture named Adaptive Weighted Mixture of Multi-Scale Expert Transformers
(AdaMixT). Specifically, AdaMixT introduces various patches and leverages both
General Pre-trained Models (GPM) and Domain-specific Models (DSM) for
multi-scale feature extraction. To accommodate the heterogeneity of temporal
features, AdaMixT incorporates a gating network that dynamically allocates
weights among different experts, enabling more accurate predictions through
adaptive multi-scale fusion. Comprehensive experiments on eight widely used
benchmarks, including Weather, Traffic, Electricity, ILI, and four ETT
datasets, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaMixT in real-world
scenarios.

*Jonatan Katz Nielsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于AIS轨迹的轻量级特征机器学习管道，在波罗的海博恩霍尔姆海峡实现92.15%准确率的船舶类型分类，随机森林模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确识别AIS轨迹中的船舶类型对海上安全监管和打击非法捕捞活动至关重要，现有方法需要改进以提升分类性能。

Method: 使用31个轨迹级特征（运动学、时空、船舶形状等），采用基于MMSI的分组训练/测试分割和分层5折交叉验证，比较多种树基模型。

Result: 随机森林结合SMOTE在测试集上达到92.15%准确率，桥位比和最大航速是最具区分度的特征，主要错误发生在货船和油轮之间。

Conclusion: 基于AIS轨迹的轻量级特征能够实现海峡区域的实时船舶类型分类，为海事监管提供有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of vessel types from Automatic Identification System
(AIS) tracks is essential for safety oversight and combating illegal,
unreported, and unregulated (IUU) activity. This paper presents a strait-scale,
machine-learning pipeline that classifies moving vessels using only AIS data.
We analyze eight days of historical AIS from the Danish Maritime Authority
covering the Bornholm Strait in the Baltic Sea (January 22-30, 2025). After
forward/backward filling voyage records, removing kinematic and geospatial
outliers, and segmenting per-MMSI tracks while excluding stationary periods
($\ge 1$ h), we derive 31 trajectory-level features spanning kinematics (e.g.,
SOG statistics), temporal, geospatial (Haversine distances, spans), and
ship-shape attributes computed from AIS A/B/C/D reference points (length,
width, aspect ratio, bridge-position ratio). To avoid leakage, we perform
grouped train/test splits by MMSI and use stratified 5-fold cross-validation.
Across five classes (cargo, tanker, passenger, high-speed craft, fishing;
N=1{,}910 trajectories; test=382), tree-based models dominate: a Random Forest
with SMOTE attains 92.15% accuracy (macro-precision 94.11%, macro-recall
92.51%, macro-F1 93.27%) on the held-out test set, while a tuned RF reaches
one-vs-rest ROC-AUC up to 0.9897. Feature-importance analysis highlights the
bridge-position ratio and maximum SOG as the most discriminative signals;
principal errors occur between cargo and tanker, reflecting similar transit
behavior. We demonstrate operational value by backfilling missing ship types on
unseen data and discuss improvements such as DBSCAN based trip segmentation and
gradient-boosted ensembles to handle frequent-stop ferries and further lift
performance. The results show that lightweight features over AIS trajectories
enable real-time vessel type classification in straits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于分块的PCA-Net框架，通过将高维解场分解为小块并在每个块内应用PCA，显著降低计算复杂度，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA方法在处理高维偏微分方程解场时计算开销大，需要更高效的方法来降低计算复杂度。

Method: 提出两种分块PCA方法：局部到全局分块PCA和局部到局部分块PCA，并探索重叠分块和CNN细化等改进技术。

Result: 分块PCA方法将端到端处理时间减少3.7-4倍，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: 基于分块的PCA是一种有前景的高效算子学习技术，特别适用于PDE系统。

Abstract: Neural operator learning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven manner. However,
applying principal component analysis (PCA) to high-dimensional solution fields
incurs significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose a
patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller
patches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the
reduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that
balance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1)
local-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off
between computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the
advantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach,
we explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i)
introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a
two-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our
results demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational
complexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline
processing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore
making it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文优化（CoOp）的新框架，将子空间表示学习与提示调优相结合，用于改进基于视觉语言模型的少样本OOD检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示学习的OOD检测方法仅依赖softmax概率，忽略了视觉语言模型在数百万样本上学习到的特征嵌入的丰富判别潜力。

Method: 通过将ID特征投影到由提示向量张成的子空间中，同时将ID无关特征投影到正交零空间中，提高ID-OOD可分离性。设计了端到端学习准则，确保强OOD检测性能和高的ID分类精度。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功利用了视觉语言模型的丰富特征表示能力，显著提升了少样本OOD检测性能。

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world
settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using
only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt
learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking
the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs
trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace
representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD
separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt
vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space.
To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end
learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as
high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase
the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子胎儿监护(EFM)/胎心监护(CTG)分析对评估胎儿健康至关重要，但目前基础模型和大型语言模型在这一领域的潜力尚未充分探索。CTG评估主要依赖主观临床解读，导致诊断准确性存在差异。

Method: 系统比较了时间序列基础模型、LLM与已建立的CTG特定架构，评估了500多个不同时长的CTG记录，反映了真实世界的临床记录。

Result: 研究结果表明，经过微调的LLM在性能上优于基础模型和领域特定方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现为胎儿监护应用中不同AI方法的相对优势提供了重要见解，并为未来产前护理中的临床AI发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains through training on massive
datasets. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance in healthcare
applications, yet their potential for electronic fetal monitoring
(EFM)/cardiotocography (CTG) analysis, a critical technology for evaluating
fetal well-being, remains largely underexplored. Antepartum CTG interpretation
presents unique challenges due to the complex nature of fetal heart rate (FHR)
patterns and uterine activity, requiring sophisticated analysis of long
time-series data. The assessment of CTG is heavily based on subjective clinical
interpretation, often leading to variability in diagnostic accuracy and
deviation from timely pregnancy care. This study presents the first
comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art AI approaches for automated
antepartum CTG analysis. We systematically compare time-series FMs and LLMs
against established CTG-specific architectures. Our evaluation encompasses over
500 CTG recordings of varying durations reflecting real-world clinical
recordings, providing robust performance benchmarks across different modelling
paradigms. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior
performance compared to both foundation models and domain-specific approaches,
offering a promising alternative pathway for clinical CTG interpretation. These
findings provide critical insights into the relative strengths of different AI
methodologies for fetal monitoring applications and establish a foundation for
future clinical AI development in prenatal care.

Conclusion: DPU辅助的负载均衡监控框架能够有效改善大型语言模型推理阶段的运行时效率，为多节点张量并行推理提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive inference in large transformer-based language models (LLMs)
presents significant challenges for runtime efficiency, particularly during the
decode phase where load imbalance across GPU shards can cause throughput
degradation and latency spikes. A DPU-assisted framework leveraged by
BlueField-3 Data Processing Units can enable real-time detection and mitigation
of load imbalance in multi-node tensor-parallel inference. By offloading
monitoring tasks to the DPU and analyzing GPU telemetry and inter-node
communication patterns, the resulting system can provide actionable feedback to
inference controllers and schedulers. The goal of this study is three-fold i)
identify the reported skews/imbalances/pathological conditions that arise in
muti-GPU execution of a) LLM tensor computing (both during training and
inference), b) identify their impact on computational performance, and c) make
a critical assessment if those can be tracked for potential mitigation from a
DPU network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的空间平衡注意力块用于时空预测，通过将空间图划分为子图并分别应用子图内注意力和子图间注意力，在保持空间邻近性的同时捕获全局相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在遵循空间邻近性和捕获全局相关性之间取得平衡，解决现有方法在处理大尺度时空数据时的局限性。

Method: 将空间图划分为子图，使用子图内注意力学习局部空间相关性，通过子图间注意力实现子图间的消息传递，并构建多尺度预测模型。

Result: 在真实世界的中大型时空数据集上，相比基线方法性能提升最高达7.7%，且运行成本较低。

Conclusion: 该方法既具有可扩展性又能产生结构化的空间相关性，实现简单且效率高，在时空预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Balance Attention block for
spatiotemporal forecasting. To strike a balance between obeying spatial
proximity and capturing global correlation, we partition the spatial graph into
a set of subgraphs and instantiate Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local
spatial correlation within each subgraph; to capture the global spatial
correlation, we further aggregate the nodes to produce subgraph representations
and achieve message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention.
Building on the proposed Spatial Balance Attention block, we develop a
multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively increasing the
subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce
structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. We
evaluate its efficacy and efficiency against the existing models on real-world
spatiotemporal datasets from medium to large sizes. The experimental results
show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 7.7% over the baseline
methods at low running costs.

TL;DR: 提出了摊销潜在引导（ALS）方法，通过离线计算单一引导向量，在推理时以恒定成本应用，避免了传统测试时优化方法的高计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时优化方法（如迭代优化和多步验证）计算成本过高，限制了在实际应用中的规模化部署。潜在空间优化方法虽然更直接，但仍需要昂贵的逐查询优化循环。

Method: ALS计算成功与失败生成之间隐藏状态的平均差异，使用这个方向来校准模型的隐藏表示。当解码偏离成功流形时，ALS将激活状态推回正确方向。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH-500基准测试中，ALS比迭代方法快2-5倍，同时达到或超过贪婪思维链和自我一致性基线，效率-准确率权衡提升高达101%。

Conclusion: 研究表明潜在优化的主要收益可以通过离线方式获得，使得复杂推理技术能够在生产环境中实际部署。

Abstract: Test-time optimization remains impractical at scale due to prohibitive
inference costs\textemdash techniques like iterative refinement and multi-step
verification can require $10$--$100\times$ more compute per query than standard
decoding. Latent space test-time optimization methods like LatentSeek offer a
more direct approach by steering hidden representations, but still demand
expensive per-query optimization loops with multiple backward passes. We
propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative
optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost
during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from
successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to
calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from
the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and
MATH-$500$ benchmarks, ALS achieves $2$--$5\times$ speedup over iterative
methods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Self-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101\% improvement in
efficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent
optimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning
techniques viable for production deployment. Code is available

Abstract: The paper presents a machine learning approach to design digital interfaces

algorithm uses Bayesian statistics to model users' browsing behavior, focusing
on their habits rather than group preferences. It is distinguished by its
online incremental learning, allowing reliable predictions even with little
data and in the case of a changing environment. This inference method generates
a task model, providing a graphical representation of navigation with the usage
statistics of the current user. The algorithm learns new tasks while preserving
prior knowledge. The theoretical framework is described, and simulations show
the effectiveness of the approach in stationary and non-stationary
environments. In conclusion, this research paves the way for adaptive systems
that improve the user experience by helping them to better navigate and act on
their interface.

TL;DR: 该论文将轻量级随机梯度下降（L-SGD）算法扩展到RISC-V架构的微控制器，通过8位量化版本显著降低了内存使用和训练时间，同时保持了可接受的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代物联网设备缺乏GPU或专用加速器，使得本地训练不可行，通常需要依赖云服务，这带来了隐私问题和连接依赖。联邦学习虽然能解决这些问题，但需要高效的优化算法。

Method: 将L-SGD算法扩展到RISC-V MCU平台，评估了32位浮点运算性能，并引入了8位量化版本的L-SGD来缓解RISC-V MCU缺乏浮点单元的限制。

Result: 8位量化L-SGD在RISC-V平台上实现了内存使用减少近4倍，训练速度提升2.2倍，且精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了在资源受限的RISC-V MCU上实现高效神经网络训练的可行性，为物联网设备的本地机器学习应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern IoT devices increasingly rely on machine learning solutions to process
data locally. However, the lack of graphics processing units (GPUs) or
dedicated accelerators on most platforms makes on-device training largely
infeasible, often requiring cloud-based services to perform this task. This
procedure often raises privacy-related concerns, and creates dependency on
reliable and always-on connectivity. Federated Learning (FL) is a new trend
that addresses these issues by enabling decentralized and collaborative
training directly on devices, but it requires highly efficient optimization
algorithms. L-SGD, a lightweight variant of stochastic gradient descent, has
enabled neural network training on Arm Cortex-M Microcontroller Units (MCUs).
This work extends L-SGD to RISC-V-based MCUs, an open and emerging architecture
that still lacks robust support for on-device training. L-SGD was evaluated on
both Arm and RISC-V platforms using 32-bit floating-point arithmetic,
highlighting the performance impact of the absence of Floating-Point Units
(FPUs) in RISC-V MCUs. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce an 8-bit
quantized version of L-SGD for RISC-V, which achieves nearly 4x reduction in
memory usage and a 2.2x speedup in training time, with negligible accuracy
degradation.

Conclusion: MOBILERL框架能有效提升移动GUI代理的性能，已应用于AutoGLM产品并开源，为移动环境中的智能代理开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Building general-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) agents has become
increasingly promising with the progress in vision language models. However,
developing effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains
challenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the
inefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic
reinforcement learning framework MOBILERL to enhance GUI agents in mobile
environments. Its core component is the Difficulty-Adaptive GRPO (ADAGRPO)
algorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and
failure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties.
We introduce the shortest path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards
concerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies
jointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong
performance across diverse mobile apps and tasks. We apply MOBILERL to two open
models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Base). The resultant MOBILERL-9B
model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of success rates on both
AndroidWorld (75.8%) and AndroidLab (46.8%). The MOBILERL framework is adopted
in the AutoGLM products, and also open-sourced at

Conclusion: 强化学习在复杂高风险医疗人力管理决策支持方面具有巨大潜力，能够有效处理现实世界中的多重约束条件。

Abstract: Healthcare systems face increasing pressure to allocate limited nursing
resources efficiently while accounting for skill heterogeneity, patient acuity,
staff fatigue, and continuity of care. Traditional optimization and heuristic
scheduling methods struggle to capture these dynamic, multi-constraint
environments. I propose NurseSchedRL, a reinforcement learning framework for
nurse-patient assignment that integrates structured state encoding, constrained
action masking, and attention-based representations of skills, fatigue, and
geographical context. NurseSchedRL uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with
feasibility masks to ensure assignments respect real-world constraints, while
dynamically adapting to patient arrivals and varying nurse availability. In
simulation with realistic nurse and patient data, NurseSchedRL achieves
improved scheduling efficiency, better alignment of skills to patient needs,
and reduced fatigue compared to baseline heuristic and unconstrained RL
approaches. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for
decision support in complex, high-stakes healthcare workforce management.

Motivation: 随着电动汽车基础设施的快速扩张，保护基于物联网的充电站免受网络威胁变得至关重要。集中式入侵检测系统因涉及敏感数据而存在隐私问题，联邦学习成为有前景的替代方案，但现有评估忽略了系统异构性和非IID数据等实际挑战。

Method: 使用FedAvg和FedAvgM这两种广泛研究的优化方法，在电动汽车充电站异常检测场景下进行实验，特别关注系统异构性和数据异构性（非IID数据）条件下的性能评估。

Result: 在IID设置下，FedAvg使用相同神经网络时性能优于集中式模型。但在非IID数据和系统异构性条件下性能下降。FedAvgM在异构环境中始终优于FedAvg，表现出更好的收敛性和更高的异常检测准确率。

Conclusion: 联邦学习能够处理物联网EVCS中的异构性问题而不造成显著性能损失，FedAvgM是构建鲁棒、隐私保护的EVCS安全系统的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized training framework widely used in
IoT ecosystems that preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, making it
ideal for IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems with sensing and communication
like Smart Grids (SGs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), and Electric
Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS). With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle
infrastructure, securing these IoT-based charging stations against cyber
threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a
promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook
practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address
these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of
federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system
and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization
approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID
settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the
same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system
heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous
settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our
results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without
significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust,
privacy-preserving EVCS security.

*Jiaqi Weng,Han Zheng,Hanyu Zhang,Qinqin He,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue,Zhixuan Chu,Xiting Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Safe-SAIL是一个用于解释LLM中稀疏自编码器(SAE)特征的框架，旨在提升安全领域的机制理解能力。该框架系统识别具有最佳概念特定可解释性的SAE，解释安全相关神经元，并引入高效策略来扩展解释过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，安全性问题日益突出。现有安全研究主要关注评估模型输出或特定安全任务，难以应对更广泛的未定义风险。SAE虽然有助于解释模型行为，但之前的研究未能用细粒度安全概念来解释特征，无法充分处理安全关键行为。

Method: 提出Safe-SAIL框架，包括：1）系统识别具有最佳概念特定可解释性的SAE；2）解释安全相关神经元；3）引入高效策略来扩展解释过程。该方法旨在提取丰富多样的安全相关特征来捕捉高风险行为。

Result: 将发布包含SAE检查点和人类可读神经元解释的全面工具包，支持对安全风险的实证分析，促进LLM安全研究。

Conclusion: Safe-SAIL框架通过解释SAE特征来推进安全领域的机制理解，为解决LLM安全风险提供了新的方法论和工具支持。

Abstract: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world
applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research
focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their
ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)
facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining
single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever,
prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained
safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical
behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu-
lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set
of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors,
yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for
generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of
detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a
framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic
understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE
with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons,
and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process.
We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and
human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of
safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.

TL;DR: 提出一种Gauss-Hermite求积方法，用于解耦机器学习代理模型中的嵌套不确定性，提高可靠性分析的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习代理模型在物理可靠性分析中应用广泛，但其模型近似误差引入的认知不确定性会与模型输入的偶然不确定性耦合，影响可靠性预测的准确性

Method: 采用Gauss-Hermite求积方法，先使用一阶和二阶可靠性方法评估偶然不确定性下的条件失效概率，然后在认知不确定性实现上积分这些概率

Result: 三个示例表明，该方法在保持计算效率的同时，比忽略模型不确定性的传统方法产生更可信的预测结果

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解耦嵌套不确定性，为基于机器学习代理模型的可靠性分析提供更准确的预测

Abstract: Machine learning surrogates are increasingly employed to replace expensive
computational models for physics-based reliability analysis. However, their use
introduces epistemic uncertainty from model approximation errors, which couples
with aleatory uncertainty in model inputs, potentially compromising the
accuracy of reliability predictions. This study proposes a Gauss-Hermite
quadrature approach to decouple these nested uncertainties and enable more
accurate reliability analysis. The method evaluates conditional failure
probabilities under aleatory uncertainty using First and Second Order
Reliability Methods and then integrates these probabilities across realizations
of epistemic uncertainty. Three examples demonstrate that the proposed approach
maintains computational efficiency while yielding more trustworthy predictions
than traditional methods that ignore model uncertainty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在地铁智能交通系统中，准确的换乘客流量预测是优化运营计划和提升运输效率的关键环节，需要更可靠的理论支持来辅助智能运营决策。

Method: 首先使用Keras构建GRU模型，然后预处理地铁刷卡数据，通过深度优先搜索算法识别乘客出行路径并构建换乘客流时间序列，接着用STL算法将时间序列分解为趋势、周期和残差分量，用3σ原则处理异常值，最后完成预测。

Conclusion: STL-GRU组合预测模型能够有效提升地铁换乘客流量的预测准确性，为地铁智能运营决策提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: In the metro intelligent transportation system, accurate transfer passenger
flow prediction is a key link in optimizing operation plans and improving
transportation efficiency. To further improve the theory of metro internal
transfer passenger flow prediction and provide more reliable support for
intelligent operation decisions, this paper innovatively proposes a metro
transfer passenger flow prediction model that integrates the Seasonal and Trend
decomposition using Loess (STL) method and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).In
practical application, the model first relies on the deep learning library
Keras to complete the construction and training of the GRU model, laying the
foundation for subsequent prediction; then preprocesses the original metro card
swiping data, uses the graph-based depth-first search algorithm to identify
passengers' travel paths, and further constructs the transfer passenger flow
time series; subsequently adopts the STL time series decomposition algorithm to
decompose the constructed transfer passenger flow time series into trend
component, periodic component and residual component, and uses the 3{\sigma}
principle to eliminate and fill the outliers in the residual component, and
finally completes the transfer passenger flow prediction.Taking the transfer
passenger flow data of a certain metro station as the research sample, the
validity of the model is verified. The results show that compared with Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the combined model of
STL time series decomposition method and Long Short-Term Memory (STL-LSTM), the
STL-GRU combined prediction model significantly improves the prediction
accuracy of transfer passenger flow on weekdays (excluding Fridays), Fridays
and rest days, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the prediction
results reduced by at least 2.3, 1.36 and 6.42 percentage points respectively.

TL;DR: 论文显示，基于Transformer的机器学习应用在解决物理问题时，其权重矩阵呈现随机特征，与物理问题的数学结构没有直接关联，这表明机器学习与科学方法可能是两种互补但不同的知识获取路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器学习模型（特别是Transformer）在解决物理问题时的内在工作机制，探索其权重矩阵是否能够反映物理问题的数学和物理结构。

Method: 分析Transformer模型在解决两个代表性物理应用时的权重矩阵特征，并与路径积分技术进行类比。

Result: 发现权重矩阵呈现随机特征，与物理问题的结构没有直接对应关系，表明严格的可解释性（网络参数与物理结构的直接对应）可能难以实现。

Conclusion: 机器学习和科学方法代表了两种不同的知识获取路径，虽然可能互补，但直接从网络参数获得物理洞察存在困难，需要警惕缺乏洞察的知识获取风险。

Abstract: It is shown that the weight matrices of transformer-based machine learning
applications to the solution of two representative physical applications show a
random-like character which bears no directly recognizable link to the physical
and mathematical structure of the physical problem under study. This suggests
that machine learning and the scientific method may represent two distinct and
potentially complementary paths to knowledge, even though a strict notion of
explainability in terms of direct correspondence between network parameters and
physical structures may remain out of reach. It is also observed that drawing a
parallel between transformer operation and (generalized) path-integration
techniques may account for the random-like nature of the weights, but still
does not resolve the tension with explainability. We conclude with some general
comments on the hazards of gleaning knowledge without the benefit of Insight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业环境中，大语言模型需要持续学习以适应动态任务，但现有持续学习方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，即训练新任务会降低对早期任务的性能。

Method: 采用双LoRA专家设计：专用专家保留任务特定知识，共享专家实现跨任务迁移；集成任务感知判别器进行对抗学习，确保共享专家只传递任务相关信息。

Result: 在MTL5基准和腾讯3基准上的实验验证了有效性，在腾讯视频平台的内容合规审查A/B测试中，手动审核成本降低了15.3%。

Conclusion: MoE-CL适用于需要持续适应和稳定迁移的大规模工业部署场景。

Abstract: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn
continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring
self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However,
existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter
isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks
degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and
weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial
mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual
instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated
LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter
independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable
cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the
shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The
discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned
information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the
shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the
discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing
knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting
self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an
industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for
continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance
review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by
15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale
industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are
critical.

Abstract: This paper investigates the privacy-preserving distributed optimization
problem, aiming to protect agents' private information from potential attackers
during the optimization process. Gradient tracking, an advanced technique for
improving the convergence rate in distributed optimization, has been applied to
most first-order algorithms in recent years. We first reveal the inherent
privacy leakage risk associated with gradient tracking. Building upon this
insight, we propose a weighted gradient tracking distributed privacy-preserving
algorithm, eliminating the privacy leakage risk in gradient tracking using
decaying weight factors. Then, we characterize the convergence of the proposed
algorithm under time-varying heterogeneous step sizes. We prove the proposed
algorithm converges precisely to the optimal solution under mild assumptions.
Finally, numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness through a
classical distributed estimation problem and the distributed training of a
convolutional neural network.

Motivation: 现有方法在建模多变量时间序列预测中的跨尺度互相关关系方面存在局限，无法有效捕捉这些关系的复杂动态特性。

Method: SDGF模型采用双路径图结构学习：基于先验知识的静态图捕捉长期稳定依赖，同时使用多级小波分解提取多尺度特征构建自适应动态图，并通过注意力门控模块融合信息，最后使用多核扩张卷积网络深化时间模式理解。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的真实世界基准数据集上的综合实验证明了所提出模型的有效性。

Conclusion: SDGF模型能够有效捕捉多尺度时间序列间的复杂相关性，在多元时间序列预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Inter-series correlations are crucial for accurate multivariate time series
forecasting, yet these relationships often exhibit complex dynamics across
different temporal scales. Existing methods are limited in modeling these
multi-scale dependencies and struggle to capture their intricate and evolving
nature. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Static-Dynamic
Graph Fusion network (SDGF), whose core lies in capturing multi-scale
inter-series correlations through a dual-path graph structure learning
approach. Specifically, the model utilizes a static graph based on prior
knowledge to anchor long-term, stable dependencies, while concurrently
employing Multi-level Wavelet Decomposition to extract multi-scale features for
constructing an adaptively learned dynamic graph to capture associations at
different scales. We design an attention-gated module to fuse these two
complementary sources of information intelligently, and a multi-kernel dilated
convolutional network is then used to deepen the understanding of temporal
patterns. Comprehensive experiments on multiple widely used real-world
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various

LLMs and an exploration of potential future trends. We then analyze how various
structural choices impact performance across benchmarks and further corroborate
our findings using mechanistic interpretability techniques. By providing
data-driven insights into LLM optimization, our work aims to guide the targeted

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA-MoE方法在模型、数据集、超参数和评估方法上缺乏统一标准，难以进行公平比较。

Method: 提出了LoRALib基准，将40个下游任务的数据集标准化为统一格式，使用相同超参数微调获得680个LoRA模块，基于此对3种代表性LoRA-MoE方法和不同LoRA选择机制进行大规模实验。

Result: 大量实验表明LoRAMoE表现最佳，优先选择与目标任务相关的LoRA能进一步提升MoE性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现将为未来工作提供启发，提出的数据集和LoRA库已开源。

Abstract: As a parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) can save significant costs in storage and computing, but its strong
adaptability to a single task is often accompanied by insufficient cross-task
generalization capabilities. To improve this, existing work combines LoRA with
mixture-of-experts (MoE) to enhance the model's adaptability through expert
modules and routing mechanisms. However, existing LoRA-MoE methods lack unified
standards in models, datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation methods, making
it difficult to conduct fair comparisons between different methods. To this
end, we proposed a unified benchmark named LoRALib. Specifically, we
standardized datasets from $40$ downstream tasks into a unified format,
fine-tuned them using the same hyperparameters and obtained $680$ LoRA modules
across $17$ model architectures. Based on this LoRA library, we conduct
large-scale experiments on $3$ representative LoRA-MoE methods and different
LoRA selection mechanisms using the open-sourced testing tool OpenCompass.
Extensive experiments show that LoRAMoE performs best, and that prioritizing
LoRAs relevant to the target task can further improve the performance of MoE.
We hope these findings will inspire future work. Our datasets and LoRA library

\emph{rank benchmark} and the \emph{distributional benchmark} established in
\citet{BergamOzcanHsu2022}. Unlike prior approaches that operate on expert

remain within the class of rank-induced distributions at every round,
preserving the equivalence with the rank benchmark. To our knowledge, RIPLM is
the first algorithm that is both (i) \emph{rank-faithful} and (ii)
\emph{variance-adaptive} in the sleeping experts setting.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了规则分类器FOLD-SE与FOLD-R++在二分类任务中的表现，以及FOLD-SE与XGBoost在多分类任务中的性能。结果表明FOLD-SE在保持可解释性的同时，性能损失很小，是平衡准确性和可解释性的有效选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型需要在准确性、效率和可解释性之间取得平衡。传统模型如神经网络虽然准确性高但缺乏透明度，因此需要开发既能提供可解释规则集又能保持良好性能的新算法。

Method: 使用分类数据集，以准确率、F1分数和处理时间作为主要性能指标，比较FOLD-SE与FOLD-R++在二分类任务中的表现，以及FOLD-SE与XGBoost在多分类任务中的表现。

Result: FOLD-SE在二分类中比FOLD-R++使用更少的规则，仅损失少量准确性和处理效率；在多分类中比XGBoost更精确高效，同时生成可理解的规则集。

Conclusion: 规则分类器如FOLD-SE能够弥合可解释性和性能之间的差距，是多样化分类任务中黑盒模型的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Recently, the demand for Machine Learning (ML) models that can balance
accuracy, efficiency, and interpreability has grown significantly.
Traditionally, there has been a tradeoff between accuracy and explainability in
predictive models, with models such as Neural Networks achieving high accuracy
on complex datasets while sacrificing internal transparency. As such, new
rule-based algorithms such as FOLD-SE have been developed that provide tangible
justification for predictions in the form of interpretable rule sets. The
primary objective of this study was to compare FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++, both
rule-based classifiers, in binary classification and evaluate how FOLD-SE
performs against XGBoost, a widely used ensemble classifier, when applied to
multi-category classification. We hypothesized that because FOLD-SE can
generate a condensed rule set in a more explainable manner, it would lose
upwards of an average of 3 percent in accuracy and F1 score when compared with
XGBoost and FOLD-R++ in multiclass and binary classification, respectively. The
research used data collections for classification, with accuracy, F1 scores,
and processing time as the primary performance measures. Outcomes show that
FOLD-SE is superior to FOLD-R++ in terms of binary classification by offering
fewer rules but losing a minor percentage of accuracy and efficiency in
processing time; in tasks that involve multi-category classifications, FOLD-SE
is more precise and far more efficient compared to XGBoost, in addition to
generating a comprehensible rule set. The results point out that FOLD-SE is a
better choice for both binary tasks and classifications with multiple
categories. Therefore, these results demonstrate that rule-based approaches
like FOLD-SE can bridge the gap between explainability and performance,
highlighting their potential as viable alternatives to black-box models in
diverse classification tasks.

Abstract: Metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), represent
a significant global health burden, disproportionately impacting genetically
predisposed populations such as the Pima Indians (a Native American tribe from
south central Arizona). This study introduces a novel machine learning (ML)
framework that integrates predictive modeling with gene-agnostic pathway
mapping to identify high-risk individuals and uncover potential therapeutic
targets. Using the Pima Indian dataset, logistic regression and t-tests were
applied to identify key predictors of T2DM, yielding an overall model accuracy
of 78.43%. To bridge predictive analytics with biological relevance, we
developed a pathway mapping strategy that links identified predictors to
critical signaling networks, including insulin signaling, AMPK, and PPAR
pathways. This approach provides mechanistic insights without requiring direct
molecular data. Building upon these connections, we propose therapeutic
strategies such as dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, AMPK activators, SIRT1
modulators, and phytochemical, further validated through pathway enrichment
analyses. Overall, this framework advances precision medicine by offering
interpretable and scalable solutions for early detection and targeted
intervention in metabolic disorders. The key contributions of this work are:
(1) development of an ML framework combining logistic regression and principal
component analysis (PCA) for T2DM risk prediction; (2) introduction of a
gene-agnostic pathway mapping approach to generate mechanistic insights; and
(3) identification of novel therapeutic strategies tailored for high-risk

*Yubo Yang,Yichen Zhu,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaSTI是一种基于条件扩散模型的时空数据插补方法，通过双向S4模型进行预插补，并利用噪声感知时空网络捕获不同扩散步骤中的依赖关系变化，在三个真实数据集上相比现有方法最多减少46.4%的插补误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空数据常因传感器故障等原因存在缺失值。现有扩散模型方法在提取时空依赖关系时存在误差累积问题，且忽略了不同扩散步骤中噪声数据的依赖关系变化。

Method: 提出AdaSTI框架，包含基于双向S4模型的BiS4PI网络进行预插补，设计时空条件器(STC)网络提取条件信息，以及带有门控注意力机制的噪声感知时空(NAST)网络捕获跨扩散步骤的变体依赖关系。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，AdaSTI在所有设置下均优于现有方法，插补误差最多减少46.4%。

Conclusion: AdaSTI通过自适应捕获不同扩散步骤中的时空依赖关系变化，显著提升了时空数据插补性能，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data abounds in domain like traffic and environmental
monitoring. However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor
malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued
efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently
diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including
spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and
utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in
diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation
in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy
data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive
Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel
spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model.
Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model
for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional
information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We
also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated
attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms
existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation
error.

*Syed Ahmad Chan Bukhari,Amritpal Singh,Shifath Hossain,Iram Wajahat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种多标签分类框架，用于预测ICU患者的护理升级触发因素（CETs），包括呼吸衰竭、血流动力学不稳定、肾功能损害和神经功能恶化。使用MIMIC-IV数据库，基于前24小时数据训练XGBoost模型，在四个CET类别上取得了优于基线模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统早期预警系统（如SOFA或MEWS）局限于单一结果预测，无法捕捉临床恶化的多维度特征。ICU患者常出现复杂、重叠的生理恶化迹象，需要及时升级护理。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据库中85,242例ICU住院数据，基于前24小时的体征聚合值、实验室指标和静态人口统计学特征，训练多标签分类模型预测24-72小时内发生的四种CETs。评估了多种分类模型，最佳模型为XGBoost。

Result: XGBoost模型在四个CET类别上的F1分数分别为：呼吸0.66、血流动力学0.72、肾功能0.76、神经系统0.62。特征分析显示呼吸频率、血压和肌酐等临床相关参数是最有影响力的预测因子。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在不依赖复杂时间序列建模或自然语言处理的情况下，实现早期、可解释临床警报的实际潜力，为ICU患者的多维度临床恶化提供了有效的预测工具。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients often present with complex, overlapping
signs of physiological deterioration that require timely escalation of care.
Traditional early warning systems, such as SOFA or MEWS, are limited by their
focus on single outcomes and fail to capture the multi-dimensional nature of
clinical decline. This study proposes a multi-label classification framework to
predict Care Escalation Triggers (CETs), including respiratory failure,
hemodynamic instability, renal compromise, and neurological deterioration,
using the first 24 hours of ICU data. Using the MIMIC-IV database, CETs are
defined through rule-based criteria applied to data from hours 24 to 72 (for
example, oxygen saturation below 90, mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg,
creatinine increase greater than 0.3 mg/dL, or a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale
score greater than 2). Features are extracted from the first 24 hours and
include vital sign aggregates, laboratory values, and static demographics. We
train and evaluate multiple classification models on a cohort of 85,242 ICU
stays (80 percent training: 68,193; 20 percent testing: 17,049). Evaluation
metrics include per-label precision, recall, F1-score, and Hamming loss.
XGBoost, the best performing model, achieves F1-scores of 0.66 for respiratory,
0.72 for hemodynamic, 0.76 for renal, and 0.62 for neurologic deterioration,
outperforming baseline models. Feature analysis shows that clinically relevant
parameters such as respiratory rate, blood pressure, and creatinine are the
most influential predictors, consistent with the clinical definitions of the
CETs. The proposed framework demonstrates practical potential for early,
interpretable clinical alerts without requiring complex time-series modeling or
natural language processing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConceptFlow是一个基于概念的CNN可解释性框架，通过追踪概念在层间的传播来模拟模型的内部"思考路径"，包含概念注意力和概念通路两个关键组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN概念可解释性方法忽视了单个过滤器的语义角色和概念在层间的动态传播，需要更深入理解模型内部推理过程。

Method: 提出ConceptFlow框架：1）概念注意力将每个过滤器与相关高级概念关联；2）概念通路通过概念转移矩阵量化概念在过滤器间的传播和转换。

Result: 实验结果表明ConceptFlow能够产生语义上有意义的模型推理洞察，验证了概念注意力和概念通路在解释决策行为方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过建模层次化概念通路，ConceptFlow为CNN内部逻辑提供了更深入的洞察，支持生成更忠实和人类对齐的解释。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretability for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aims
to align internal model representations with high-level semantic concepts, but
existing approaches largely overlook the semantic roles of individual filters
and the dynamic propagation of concepts across layers. To address these
limitations, we propose ConceptFlow, a concept-based interpretability framework
that simulates the internal "thinking path" of a model by tracing how concepts
emerge and evolve across layers. ConceptFlow comprises two key components: (i)
concept attentions, which associate each filter with relevant high-level
concepts to enable localized semantic interpretation, and (ii) conceptual
pathways, derived from a concept transition matrix that quantifies how concepts
propagate and transform between filters. Together, these components offer a
unified and structured view of internal model reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that ConceptFlow yields semantically meaningful insights into model
reasoning, validating the effectiveness of concept attentions and conceptual
pathways in explaining decision behavior. By modeling hierarchical conceptual
pathways, ConceptFlow provides deeper insight into the internal logic of CNNs
and supports the generation of more faithful and human-aligned explanations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏表示的训练效率框架STS，通过视觉令牌压缩器和层动态跳过器来减少多模态大语言模型的训练计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型训练效率低下，主要由于多模态数据引入的长输入序列和层间计算利用率低

Method: STS框架包含两个关键组件：视觉令牌压缩器（压缩视觉令牌减少信息负载）和层动态跳过器（在前后向传播中动态跳过语言模型的不必要层）

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试上进行了广泛评估，证明了其有效性和效率

Conclusion: 提出的稀疏训练方案适用于多种MLLM架构，能显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance across a variety of domains. However, training MLLMs is often
inefficient due to the significantly longer input sequences introduced by
multimodal data and the low utilization of inter-layer computations. To address
this challenge, we shift the focus to the training process itself and propose a
novel training-efficient framework based on sparse representations, termed the
Sparse Training Scheme (STS). This scheme consists of two key components: the
Visual Token Compressor, which reduces the information load by compressing
visual tokens, and the Layer Dynamic Skipper, which mitigates the computational
overhead by dynamically skipping unnecessary layers in the language model
during both forward and backward passes. Our approach is broadly applicable to
diverse MLLM architectures and has been extensively evaluated on multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: HyperNAS提出了一种新的神经架构搜索预测器范式，通过全局编码方案和共享超网络增强架构表示学习，在少样本场景下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经架构搜索性能评估耗时严重，现有神经预测器由于难以捕捉复杂架构间关系而泛化能力差

Method: HyperNAS包含全局编码方案捕捉宏观结构信息，共享超网络作为辅助任务增强架构间模式研究，并开发动态自适应多任务损失确保训练稳定性

Result: 在5个代表性搜索空间上的实验显示HyperNAS在少样本场景下优势明显，在CIFAR-10上达到97.60% top-1准确率，ImageNet上达到82.4% top-1准确率，样本使用量减少至少5倍

Conclusion: HyperNAS在神经架构搜索预测器领域取得了新的最先进成果，特别适用于数据稀缺场景

Abstract: Time-intensive performance evaluations significantly impede progress in
Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To address this, neural predictors leverage
surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance
predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor
generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships
among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural
predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS
consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared
hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the
comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves
as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture
patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive
multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front.
Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs,
demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For
instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1
accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least
5.0$\times$ fewer samples.

TL;DR: WLFM是一个用于测井解释的基础模型，通过三阶段训练（标记化、自监督预训练、多任务适应）在1200口井的多曲线测井数据上预训练，在孔隙度估计和岩性分类任务上优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测井解释对于地下表征至关重要，但面临工具响应异质性、噪声信号和标签有限的挑战，需要开发更强大的基础模型。

Method: 三阶段方法：1）将测井数据块标记化为地质标记；2）使用掩码标记建模和地层感知对比学习的自监督预训练；3）少样本微调的多任务适应。

Result: WLFM在孔隙度估计上达到0.0041 MSE，岩性分类准确率74.13%；微调后进一步提升至0.0038 MSE和78.10%准确率。模型展现出层感知能力，学习可重用的地质词汇表。

Conclusion: WLFM为地质AI建立了可扩展、可解释和可迁移的骨干网络，为测井、地震和文本数据的多模态集成提供了基础。

Abstract: Well-log interpretation is fundamental for subsurface characterization but
remains challenged by heterogeneous tool responses, noisy signals, and limited
labels. We propose WLFM, a foundation model pretrained on multi-curve logs from
1200 wells, comprising three stages: tokenization of log patches into
geological tokens, self-supervised pretraining with masked-token modeling and
stratigraphy-aware contrastive learning, and multi-task adaptation with
few-shot fine-tuning. WLFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving 0.0041 MSE in porosity estimation and 74.13\% accuracy in lithology
classification, while WLFM-Finetune further improves to 0.0038 MSE and 78.10\%
accuracy. Beyond predictive accuracy, WLFM exhibits emergent layer-awareness,
learns a reusable geological vocabulary, and reconstructs masked curves with
reasonable fidelity, though systematic offsets are observed in shallow and
ultra-deep intervals. Although boundary detection is not explicitly evaluated
here, clustering analyses suggest strong potential for future extension. These
results establish WLFM as a scalable, interpretable, and transferable backbone
for geological AI, with implications for multi-modal integration of logs,
seismic, and textual data.

Motivation: 抗菌素耐药性（AMR）预计到205年每年导致1000万人死亡，迫切需要新的抗生素。现有方法在快速生成多样化、有效的候选抗生素方面存在挑战。

Method: 首先在精选的肽数据上微调蛋白质语言模型以捕捉抗菌序列规律，然后使用近端策略优化结合复合奖励函数进行优化，包括最小抑菌浓度分类器预测和可微分物理化学目标。

Result: 体外评估100个设计肽显示所有候选物均具有低MIC值（部分达到纳摩尔范围），100%命中率。99/100化合物对至少两种临床相关细菌表现出广谱抗菌活性。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths
annually by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Here we
present ApexAmphion, a deep-learning framework for de novo design of
antibiotics that couples a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with
reinforcement learning. The model is first fine-tuned on curated peptide data
to capture antimicrobial sequence regularities, then optimised with proximal
policy optimization against a composite reward that combines predictions from a
learned minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classifier with differentiable
physicochemical objectives. In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed
low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit
rate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial
activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules
killed bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. By
unifying generation, scoring and multi-objective optimization with deep
reinforcement learning in a single pipeline, our approach rapidly produces
diverse, potent candidates, offering a scalable route to peptide antibiotics
and a platform for iterative steering toward potency and developability within
hours.

Motivation: 传统的激活函数（如ReLU、tanh、sigmoid）是静态选择的，通过优化激活函数的形状，可以训练出更参数高效和准确的模型。

Method: 使用参数化线性B样条激活函数，提出并比较了9种训练方法，探索神经网络中的双重优化动态。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比传统ReLU模型，FNNs的错误率降低94%，CNNs的错误率降低51%。

Conclusion: 通过优化激活函数形状可以获得显著的性能提升，但需要付出额外的开发、训练复杂性和模型延迟的代价。

Abstract: Activation functions in neural networks are typically selected from a set of
empirically validated, commonly used static functions such as ReLU, tanh, or
sigmoid. However, by optimizing the shapes of a network's activation functions,
we can train models that are more parameter-efficient and accurate by assigning
more optimal activations to the neurons. In this paper, I present and compare 9
training methodologies to explore dual-optimization dynamics in neural networks
with parameterized linear B-spline activation functions. The experiments
realize up to 94% lower end model error rates in FNNs and 51% lower rates in
CNNs compared to traditional ReLU-based models. These gains come at the cost of
additional development and training complexity as well as end model latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究最后一公里配送中卡车和无人机的协同作业问题，特别关注电池管理的实际约束条件（无人机飞行速度是卡车的两倍，每次飞行需满足续航预算，每次投递后需在卡车上充电）。

Method: 开发混合强化学习求解器：使用ALNS算法规划卡车路径（包含2/3-opt和Or-opt优化），配合小型指针/注意力策略调度无人机飞行任务。策略通过硬可行性掩码确保续航和充电约束，采用精确时间线模拟器计算真实完成时间。

Result: 在N=50、E=0.7、R=0.1的欧几里得实例上，该方法平均完成时间为5.203±0.093，相比ALNS的5.349±0.038和NN的5.208±0.124，平均比ALNS优2.73%，与NN相差仅0.10%。学习到的调度器能平衡卡车等待时间以最小化总完成时间。

Conclusion: 混合强化学习方法在卡车-无人机协同配送问题上表现出色，能够有效处理电池管理约束，实现优于传统启发式算法的性能，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We study last-mile delivery with one truck and one drone under explicit
battery management: the drone flies at twice the truck speed; each sortie must
satisfy an endurance budget; after every delivery the drone recharges on the
truck before the next launch. We introduce a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL)
solver that couples an ALNS-based truck tour (with 2/3-opt and Or-opt) with a
small pointer/attention policy that schedules drone sorties. The policy decodes
launch--serve--rendezvous triplets with hard feasibility masks for endurance
and post-delivery recharge; a fast, exact timeline simulator enforces
launch/recovery handling and computes the true makespan used by masked
greedy/beam decoding. On Euclidean instances with $N{=}50$, $E{=}0.7$, and
$R{=}0.1$, the method achieves an average makespan of \textbf{5.203}$\pm$0.093,
versus \textbf{5.349}$\pm$0.038 for ALNS and \textbf{5.208}$\pm$0.124 for NN --
i.e., \textbf{2.73\%} better than ALNS on average and within \textbf{0.10\%} of
NN. Per-seed, the RL scheduler never underperforms ALNS on the same instance
and ties or beats NN on two of three seeds. A decomposition of the makespan
shows the expected truck--wait trade-off across heuristics; the learned
scheduler balances both to minimize the total completion time. We provide a
config-first implementation with plotting and significance-test utilities to
support replication.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a new architecture
following auto regressive models. Their denoising process offers a powerful
generative advantage, but they present significant challenges in learning and
understanding numerically sensitive mathematical and order-sensitive logical
tasks. Current training methods, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and
reinforcement learning, focus primarily on improving general knowledge
retention and reasoning abilities, but lack a comprehensive understanding of
mathematical and logical patterns. We propose DSFT, a simple yet effective
Diffusion SFT strategy, by adjusting the masking strategy and loss function,
guiding models to understand mathematical and logical patterns. This strategy
can be flexibly combined with pre-training, reinforcement learning, and other
training methods. Validated on models such as LLaDA and Dream series, we prove
that DSFT on small-scale data can achieve improvements of 5-10% and
approximately 2% on mathematical and logical problems, respectively. This
inspiring masking approach offers insights for future learning of specific
patterns, which can be easily and efficiently combined with other training
methods and applied to various dLLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile communication technologies, future
mobile networks will offer vast services and resources for commuting,
production, daily life, and entertainment. Accurate and efficient forecasting
of mobile data (e.g., cell traffic, user behavior, channel quality) helps
operators monitor network state changes, orchestrate wireless resources, and
schedule infrastructure and users, thereby improving supply efficiency and
service quality. However, current forecasting paradigms rely on customized
designs with tailored models for exclusive data types. Such approaches increase
complexity and deployment costs under large-scale, heterogeneous networks
involving base stations, users, and channels. In this paper, we design a
foundation model for mobile data forecasting, MobiGPT, with a unified structure
capable of forecasting three data types: base station traffic, user app usage,
and channel quality. We propose a soft-prompt learning method to help the model
understand features of different data types, and introduce a temporal masking
mechanism to guide the model through three forecasting tasks: short-term
prediction, long-term prediction, and distribution generation, supporting
diverse optimization scenarios. Evaluations on real-world datasets with over
100,000 samples show that MobiGPT achieves accurate multi-type forecasting.
Compared to existing models, it improves forecasting accuracy by 27.37%,
20.08%, and 7.27%, reflecting strong generalization. Moreover, MobiGPT exhibits
superior zero/few-shot performance in unseen scenarios, with over 21.51%
improvement, validating its strong transferability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Complex systems typically rely on high-precision numerical computation to
support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot yet
incorporate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with
existing architectures. Mainstream multi-agent approaches can leverage external
experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from
inefficient multimodal emergent capability and limited scalability. To this
end, we propose PiMoE (Physically-isolated Mixture of Experts), a training and
inference architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of
the workflow paradigm of tool invocation, PiMoE endogenously integrates
computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training
experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router
directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling
iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiMoE on
two reasoning-computation tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent
system approaches. Results show that the PiMoE architecture achieves not only
higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements
in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with
mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiMoE offers an efficient, interpretable,
and scalable paradigm for next-generation scientific or industrial intelligent
systems.

*Zhanting Zhou,KaHou Tam,Zeqin Wu,Pengzhao Sun,Jinbo Wang,Fengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedIA框架通过投影优先策略解决联邦图学习中域偏移导致的梯度噪声问题，使用重要性感知的两阶段管道来去噪客户端更新，实现更稳定高效的聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习在域偏移场景下（如Twitch Gamers和多语言Wikipedia网络）会导致客户端模型表示不兼容，传统聚合方法不稳定且低效。研究发现主要问题不是权重方案而是噪声梯度信号。

Method: 提出FedIA框架，采用投影优先而非聚合优先策略：1）服务器端top-ρ掩码保留约5%最具信息量的坐标；2）轻量级影响正则化动量权重抑制异常客户端。该方法无需额外上行流量且服务器内存开销可忽略。

Result: 在Twitch Gamers和Wikipedia图上，FedIA相比9个强基线方法实现了更平滑稳定的收敛和更高的最终准确率。收敛分析表明动态投影保持了最优的O(σ²/√T)收敛速率。

Conclusion: FedIA通过重要性感知的投影优先策略有效解决了联邦图学习中的域偏移问题，提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) under domain skew -- as observed on platforms
such as \emph{Twitch Gamers} and multilingual \emph{Wikipedia} networks --
drives client models toward incompatible representations, rendering naive
aggregation both unstable and ineffective. We find that the culprit is not the
weighting scheme but the \emph{noisy gradient signal}: empirical analysis of
baseline methods suggests that a vast majority of gradient dimensions can be
dominated by domain-specific variance. We therefore shift focus from
"aggregation-first" to a \emph{projection-first} strategy that denoises client
updates \emph{before} they are combined. The proposed FedIA framework realises
this \underline{I}mportance-\underline{A}ware idea through a two-stage,
plug-and-play pipeline: (i) a server-side top-$\rho$ mask keeps only the most
informative about 5% of coordinates, and (ii) a lightweight
influence-regularised momentum weight suppresses outlier clients. FedIA adds
\emph{no extra uplink traffic and only negligible server memory}, making it
readily deployable. On both homogeneous (Twitch Gamers) and heterogeneous
(Wikipedia) graphs, it yields smoother, more stable convergence and higher
final accuracy than nine strong baselines. A convergence sketch further shows
that dynamic projection maintains the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ rate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBVR是一种新颖的大语言模型量化方法，通过高斯分布感知的码本表示和定制CUDA内核，在4位量化下实现最先进的性能，同时获得2.21-3.04倍的端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ方法存在局限性：RTN方法无法处理LLM权重的类高斯分布，码本方法虽然考虑分布但存在内存访问模式问题导致推理速度下降。需要一种既能准确压缩又能高效推理的量化方法。

Method: 提出SBVR方法，将权重值映射到非均匀表示点，其分布遵循LLM权重的实际高斯分布。设计定制CUDA内核，支持在SBVR格式下直接进行矩阵向量乘法而无需解压缩。

Conclusion: SBVR通过硬件友好的高斯分布码本表示和定制内核设计，成功解决了现有量化方法的局限性，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous Post-Training
Quantization (PTQ) strategies have been proposed to alleviate deployment
barriers created by their enormous parameter counts. Quantization achieves
compression by limiting the number of representable points in the data.
Therefore, the key to achieving efficient quantization is selecting the optimal
combination of representation points, or codes, for the given data. Existing
PTQ solutions adopt two major approaches to this problem: Round-To-Nearest
(RTN)-based methods and codebook-based methods. RTN-based methods map LLM
weights onto uniformly distributed integer grids, failing to account for the
Gaussian-like weight distribution of LLM weights. Codebook-based methods
mitigate this issue by constructing distribution-aware codebooks; however, they
suffer from random and strided memory access patterns, resulting in degraded
inference speed that is exacerbated by the limited size of GPU L1 cache. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM quantization method, SBVR
(Summation of BitVector Representation), that enables Gaussian-like code
representation in a hardware-friendly manner for fast inference. SBVR maps
weight values to non-uniform representation points whose distribution follows
the actual distribution of LLM weights, enabling more accurate compression.
Additionally, we design a custom CUDA kernel that allows matrix-vector
multiplication directly in the SBVR format without decompression, thereby
enabling high-performance execution of SBVR-compressed models. Our evaluations
of SBVR on various models demonstrate state-of-the-art perplexity and accuracy
benchmark performance while delivering a 2.21x- 3.04x end-to-end
token-generation speedup over naive FP16 models in the 4-bit quantization
regime.

Motivation: 人类可以通过自然语言理解地理空间信息，但LLM的地理空间认知能力尚未得到充分探索。先前研究受到不可量化指标、有限评估数据集和不清晰研究层次的限制。

Method: 创建包含12个全球大都市36000条路线的大规模评估数据集；开发PathBuilder工具实现自然语言指令与导航路线的双向转换；提出新的评估框架和指标来评估LLM的路线反转能力。

Result: LLM在路线反转任务上表现有限：大多数反转路线既没有返回起点，也与最优路线不相似。LLM还面临路线生成鲁棒性低和对错误答案置信度高的问题。

Conclusion: LLM在地理空间路线认知方面存在显著局限性，需要进一步研究来提升其地理空间理解能力。

Abstract: Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while
the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by
non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research
hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a
large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises
worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural
language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap
between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new
evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art
(SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs
exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the
starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face
challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for
their incorrect answers. Code\ \&\ Data available here:

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态思维链（MCoT）框架，用于解决对话式导航中的自我中心到异我中心的空间定向问题，在中文对话导航基准上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内或复杂环境中GPS信号弱、详细地图不可用时，对话代理需要将自我中心表述转换为异我中心方向的关键挑战。

Method: 提出多模态思维链框架，整合ASR转录语音和地标坐标，通过三步推理过程：提取空间关系、坐标映射到绝对方向、推断用户朝向，并采用课程学习策略在Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat模型上实现。

Result: MCoT在清晰转录文本上达到100%定向准确率，在ASR转录文本上达到98.1%，显著优于单模态和非结构化基线，并在噪声对话条件下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结构化MCoT空间推理为实现可解释和资源高效的具身导航提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Conversational agents must translate egocentric utterances (e.g., "on my
right") into allocentric orientations (N/E/S/W). This challenge is particularly
critical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and
detailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has
advanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal
spatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational
Orientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese
conversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing
egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed
scenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which
integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a
structured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)
mapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.
A curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on
Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of
resource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%
orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,
substantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover,
MCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including
ASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also
maintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic
variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight
the potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward
interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.

Conclusion: 该方法为高效有效的任务向量组合建立了新标准，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Task vectors capture how a model changes during fine-tuning by recording the
difference between pre-trained and task-specific weights. The composition of
task vectors, a key operator in task arithmetic, enables models to integrate
knowledge from multiple tasks without incurring additional inference costs. In
this paper, we propose variational task vector composition, where composition
coefficients are taken as latent variables and estimated in a Bayesian
inference framework. Unlike previous methods that operate at the task level,
our framework focuses on sample-specific composition. Motivated by the
observation of structural redundancy in task vectors, we introduce a
Spike-and-Slab prior that promotes sparsity and preserves only the most
informative components. To further address the high variance and sampling
inefficiency in sparse, high-dimensional spaces, we develop a gated sampling
mechanism that constructs a controllable posterior by filtering the composition
coefficients based on both uncertainty and importance. This yields a more
stable and interpretable variational framework by deterministically selecting
reliable task components, reducing sampling variance while improving
transparency and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets by
selectively leveraging the most reliable and informative components in task
vectors. These findings highlight the practical value of our approach,
establishing a new standard for efficient and effective task vector
composition.

Result: 在七个不同基准测试中，FastMTP相比标准下一个令牌预测实现2.03倍平均加速，输出质量无损，性能优于普通MTP 82%。

Conclusion: FastMTP仅需轻量级训练，可无缝集成到现有推理框架中，为加速LLM推理提供了实用且快速部署的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, the sequential
nature of autoregressive generation creates a fundamental throughput bottleneck
that limits the practical deployment. While Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has
demonstrated remarkable benefits for model training efficiency and performance,
its inherent potential for inference acceleration remains largely unexplored.
This paper introduces FastMTP, a simple yet effective method that improves
multi-step draft quality by aligning MTP training with its inference pattern,
significantly enhancing speculative decoding performance. Our approach
fine-tunes a single MTP head with position-shared weights on self-distilled
data, enabling it to capture dependencies among consecutive future tokens and
maintain high acceptance rates across multiple recursive draft steps. By
integrating language-aware dynamic vocabulary compression into the MTP head, we
further reduce computational overhead in the drafting process. Experimental
results across seven diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FastMTP achieves an
average of 2.03x speedup compared to standard next token prediction with
lossless output quality, outperforming vanilla MTP by 82%. FastMTP requires
only lightweight training and seamlessly integrates with existing inference
frameworks, offering a practical and rapidly deployable solution for
accelerating LLM inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in distributed swarm learning (DSL) offer a promising
paradigm for edge Internet of Things. Such advancements enhance data privacy,
communication efficiency, energy saving, and model scalability. However, the
presence of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data pose
a significant challenge for multi-access edge computing, degrading learning
performance and diverging training behavior of vanilla DSL. Further, there
still lacks theoretical guidance on how data heterogeneity affects model
training accuracy, which requires thorough investigation. To fill the gap, this
paper first study the data heterogeneity by measuring the impact of non-i.i.d.
datasets under the DSL framework. This then motivates a new multi-worker
selection design for DSL, termed M-DSL algorithm, which works effectively with
distributed heterogeneous data. A new non-i.i.d. degree metric is introduced
and defined in this work to formulate the statistical difference among local
datasets, which builds a connection between the measure of data heterogeneity
and the evaluation of DSL performance. In this way, our M-DSL guides effective
selection of multiple works who make prominent contributions for global model
updates. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence behavior of
our M-DSL, followed by extensive experiments on different heterogeneous
datasets and non-i.i.d. data settings. Numerical results verify performance
improvement and network intelligence enhancement provided by our M-DSL beyond
the benchmarks.

Conclusion: GnnXemplar提供了一种新颖的全局解释框架，能够有效解释GNN在大规模图数据上的预测，具有更好的可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification, yet
their opaque decision-making limits trust and adoption. While local
explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation
methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped.
Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach
that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is
rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex
structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global
explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar
identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and
explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their
neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem
over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy
approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt
strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse
benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in
fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study
with 60 participants.

Conclusion: 将图结构和上下文语义整合到轨迹建模中，能够实现更精确和上下文感知的异常检测

Abstract: Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and
unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent
transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention.
  Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and
its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations,
with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level
abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space,
neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying
movement network, e.g., road or transit networks.
  The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework
tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical
travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network
to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and
transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings
that reflect the spatial layout of the road network.
  A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a
multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised
link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations.
  To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence
Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that
emphasizes high-confidence deviations.
  Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD
achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in
detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results
highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual
semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware
anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解情境强化学习的理论基础迈出了重要一步，表明预训练过程中的损失最小化是产生情境学习能力的关键因素。

Abstract: Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by
updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task.
Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of
new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on
some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making
parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional
input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new
task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context
increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically
called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network
enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the
pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this
paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network
parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL
are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for
this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a
Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers
of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.

Abstract: We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR)
method, also called Reverse-CGR (R-CGR), for biological sequence analysis that
addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss
of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces
complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with
rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction
from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our
reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains
both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving
competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while
providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates
feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete
sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for
interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery
are essential.

*Chang Liu,Ladda Thiamwong,Yanjie Fu,Rui Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KANDI是一种结合Kolmogorov-Arnold网络和扩散策略的离线逆强化学习方法，旨在解决医疗健康领域中离线强化学习的奖励函数定义困难和对齐人类行为挑战的问题，特别是在老年人跌倒风险干预的体力活动促进应用中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在医疗健康应用中面临两大挑战：直接奖励难以定义，以及逆强化学习在复杂环境中难以从专家行为中推断准确的奖励函数。此外，离线强化学习还需要解决学习策略与观察到的医疗健康应用中人类行为对齐的问题。

Method: 提出KANDI方法，利用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的灵活函数逼近能力从低跌倒风险老年人（专家）的行为中学习奖励函数，同时在Actor-Critic框架内使用基于扩散的策略进行动作细化和离线强化学习的效率优化。

Result: KANDI在基于可穿戴活动监测数据的双臂临床试验中进行了评估，并在D4RL基准测试中优于最先进的方法，显示出在跌倒风险干预项目中促进老年人体力活动的实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: KANDI有潜力解决医疗健康应用中离线强化学习的关键挑战，为医疗健康领域的活动促进干预策略提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Utilizing offline reinforcement learning (RL) with real-world clinical data
is getting increasing attention in AI for healthcare. However, implementation
poses significant challenges. Defining direct rewards is difficult, and inverse
RL (IRL) struggles to infer accurate reward functions from expert behavior in
complex environments. Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned
policies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address
challenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older
adults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we
introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function
approximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by
learning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults
(experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework
provide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline
RL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm
clinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study,
emphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to
promote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore
KANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare
applications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion
intervention strategies in healthcare.

Conclusion: 该框架为开发数据驱动代理模型加速复杂结构系统分析提供了强大且通用的方法

Abstract: The simulation of complex physical systems using a discretized mesh is a
cornerstone of applied mechanics, but traditional numerical solvers are often
computationally prohibitive for many-query tasks. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their
standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued
by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce
MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs
with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of
challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional
elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in
long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial
computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful
and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate
the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种AI驱动的框架，用于为给定线性系统推荐MCMC预条件器参数，通过图神经网络预测预条件速度，并使用贝叶斯采集函数选择最优参数集，在相同搜索预算下比传统方法减少50%的迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型稀疏线性系统中Krylov子空间求解器对病态矩阵收敛缓慢的问题，传统MCMC预条件器参数优化需要手动或网格搜索，成本高昂。

Method: 使用图神经网络构建代理模型预测预条件速度，结合贝叶斯采集函数自动选择最优MCMC参数集。

Result: 在未见过的病态系统上，该框架用传统方法50%的搜索预算实现了更好的预条件效果，收敛迭代次数减少约10%。

Conclusion: 该研究为将MCMC预条件器集成到大规模系统提供了一条可行路径，展示了AI驱动参数优化的有效性。

Abstract: Large, sparse linear systems are pervasive in modern science and engineering,
and Krylov subspace solvers are an established means of solving them. Yet
convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments
usually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix
inversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations,
but its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices;
manual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending
MCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts
preconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition
function then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On
a previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better
preconditioning with 50\% of the search budget of conventional methods,
yielding about a 10\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results
suggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale
systems.

Motivation: 解决血糖预测中不同采样率信号整合的挑战，以及模型在持续学习新患者队列时的性能稳定性问题。

Conclusion: GluMind框架有效解决了多模态血糖预测的挑战，在持续学习场景下展现出优越的性能和适应性。

Abstract: This paper proposes GluMind, a transformer-based multimodal framework
designed for continual and long-term blood glucose forecasting. GluMind devises
two attention mechanisms, including cross-attention and multi-scale attention,
which operate in parallel and deliver accurate predictive performance.
Cross-attention effectively integrates blood glucose data with other
physiological and behavioral signals such as activity, stress, and heart rate,
addressing challenges associated with varying sampling rates and their adverse
impacts on robust prediction. Moreover, the multi-scale attention mechanism
captures long-range temporal dependencies. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
GluMind incorporates a knowledge retention technique into the transformer-based
forecasting model. The knowledge retention module not only enhances the model's
ability to retain prior knowledge but also boosts its overall forecasting
performance. We evaluate GluMind on the recently released AIREADI dataset,
which contains behavioral and physiological data collected from healthy people,
individuals with prediabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes. We examine the
performance stability and adaptability of GluMind in learning continuously as
new patient cohorts are introduced. Experimental results show that GluMind
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting models, achieving
approximately 15% and 9% improvements in root mean squared error (RMSE) and
mean absolute error (MAE), respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了概率几何主成分分析（PGPCA），这是一种新的降维算法，能够显式地结合非线性流形知识，将概率主成分分析（PPCA）推广到非线性几何结构，以更好地描述分布在流形周围的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的PPCA及其扩展主要基于线性模型，只能描述欧几里得坐标系中的数据。然而在神经科学等应用中，数据可能分布在非线性几何（即流形）周围，而非欧几里得空间中。

Method: 开发了PGPCA算法，首先从数据中拟合非线性流形，然后推导出几何坐标系来捕捉数据与流形的偏差和噪声。还推导了数据驱动的EM算法来学习PGPCA模型参数。

Result: 在模拟和脑数据分析中，PGPCA能够有效建模各种给定流形周围的数据分布，并且在此类数据上优于PPCA。PGPCA还提供了测试几何坐标系是否比欧几里得坐标系更好地描述数据的能力。

Conclusion: PGPCA能够执行降维并学习流形周围和流形上的数据分布，这些能力使其对于分析具有噪声且分布在非线性流形周围的高维数据具有重要价值。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science
including neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a
prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic
approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection
between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its
extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in
a Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data
may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than
lying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal
Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction
algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear
manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition
to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be
derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold
and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA
model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data
distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations
and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data
distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data.
Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric
coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally,
PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both
around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for
enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of
high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear
manifold.

Motivation: 连续时间扩散模型在训练和推理之间存在不匹配问题，且通常局限于加性高斯噪声。离散时间过程可以避免这些问题，并可能减少推理步骤。

Method: 提出了几种离散时间扩散过程变体，包括加性高斯噪声、乘性高斯噪声、模糊噪声以及模糊和高斯噪声的混合。

Conclusion: 离散时间扩散过程是连续时间扩散模型的有效替代方案，具有更好的训练和推理一致性，以及更高的效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These
models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient
training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising,
which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to
the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions.
Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not
have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and
are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores
some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants.
These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative
Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises.
The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable
subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous
counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.

Motivation: 高维嵌入向量在表示非结构化数据和语义搜索时存在存储和检索成本高的问题，需要一种高效的压缩技术来解决这些挑战。

Conclusion: NVQ是一种有效的向量压缩解决方案，在高保真度压缩方面优于现有技术，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Embedding vectors are widely used for representing unstructured data and
searching through it for semantically similar items. However, the large size of
these vectors, due to their high-dimensionality, creates problems for modern
vector search techniques: retrieving large vectors from memory/storage is
expensive and their footprint is costly. In this work, we present NVQ
(non-uniform vector quantization), a new vector compression technique that is
computationally and spatially efficient in the high-fidelity regime. The core
in NVQ is to use novel parsimonious and computationally efficient
nonlinearities for building non-uniform vector quantizers. Critically, these
quantizers are \emph{individually} learned for each indexed vector. Our
experimental results show that NVQ exhibits improved accuracy compared to the
state of the art with a minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: SimpleFold挑战了蛋白质折叠领域对复杂领域特定架构设计的依赖，为未来进展开辟了替代设计空间。

Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a
combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and
training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across
different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these
architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In
this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein
folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein
folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving
triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training
objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs
standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a
generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale
SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein
structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks,
SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble
prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic
reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold
shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware.
SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures
designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future
progress.

Result: 该方法仅需200个样本（传统Temporal Convolution Networks需要3,700个），准确率显著提升，仅需传统方法5.4%的训练数据。

Conclusion: 物理信息KANs相比传统黑盒模型具有明显优势，在保持数学严谨性和物理一致性的同时大幅降低数据需求，为量子动力学建模提供了有前景的新途径。

Abstract: The prediction of quantum dynamical responses lies at the heart of modern
physics. Yet, modeling these time-dependent behaviors remains a formidable
challenge because quantum systems evolve in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
often rendering traditional numerical methods computationally prohibitive.
While large language models have achieved remarkable success in sequential
prediction, quantum dynamics presents a fundamentally different challenge:
forecasting the entire temporal evolution of quantum systems rather than merely
the next element in a sequence. Existing neural architectures such as recurrent
and convolutional networks often require vast training datasets and suffer from
spurious oscillations that compromise physical interpretability. In this work,
we introduce a fundamentally new approach: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs)
augmented with physics-informed loss functions that enforce the Ehrenfest
theorems. Our method achieves superior accuracy with significantly less
training data: it requires only 5.4 percent of the samples (200) compared to
Temporal Convolution Networks (3,700). We further introduce the Chain of KANs,
a novel architecture that embeds temporal causality directly into the model
design, making it particularly well-suited for time series modeling. Our
results demonstrate that physics-informed KANs offer a compelling advantage
over conventional black-box models, maintaining both mathematical rigor and
physical consistency while dramatically reducing data requirements.

Abstract: Money laundering is a critical global issue for financial institutions.
Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN),
can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for
developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy
and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the
statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality
has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely
synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes
the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by
incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features.
These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but
also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial
institutions to enhance AML systems.

TL;DR: APRIL是一种新的强化学习训练方法，通过主动部分rollout策略解决长尾响应分布导致的GPU空闲问题，提高训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL训练中，rollout生成占用了90%以上的运行时间，且长尾响应分布导致GPU空闲和利用率低下，限制了模型的可扩展性。

Method: APRIL在rollout阶段过度配置请求，一旦达到目标响应数量就终止，并将未完成的响应回收用于后续步骤的继续处理。

Result: 实验显示APRIL在常用RL算法上最多提高44%的rollout吞吐量，加速收敛，并在任务上获得最多8%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: APRIL统一了系统级和算法级考虑，提高了RL训练效率，且与框架和硬件无关，已在slime RL框架中集成。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale
pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o
series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale
RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the
community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most
of these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation
and training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains
computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%
of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the
long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy
responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model
and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits
scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in
Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the
rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the
target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for
continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are
discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that
APRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL
algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8%
higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and
hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and
deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies
system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of
advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为反向互补一致性正则化（RCCR）的简单且模型无关的微调目标，通过直接惩罚模型在序列及其反向互补序列上预测差异，显著提高DNA语言模型的对称性鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA序列的反向互补序列通常具有相同的生物学意义，但现有DNA语言模型经常无法捕捉这种对称性，导致对序列及其反向互补序列的预测不一致，降低了模型的可靠性。

Method: 引入RCCR正则化目标，在微调过程中直接最小化模型对原始序列和其反向互补序列预测之间的差异。该方法在三种不同骨干网络（Nucleotide Transformer、HyenaDNA、DNABERT-2）上进行了评估，涵盖序列分类、标量回归和轮廓预测等多种基因组任务。

Result: RCCR显著提高了反向互补鲁棒性，大幅减少了预测翻转和错误，同时在任务准确性上保持或优于基线方法（如反向互补数据增强和测试时平均）。

Conclusion: 通过将关键生物学先验直接整合到学习过程中，RCCR为多样化的生物学任务提供了一种单一、内在鲁棒且计算高效的模型微调方案。

Abstract: A fundamental property of DNA is that the reverse complement (RC) of a
sequence often carries identical biological meaning. However, state-of-the-art
DNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing
inconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which
undermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement
Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning
objective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction
on a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate
RCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA,
DNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification,
scalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR
substantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips
and errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to
baselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating
a key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a
single, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning
recipe for diverse biology tasks.

Motivation: 传统MoE模型通过复制单个预训练模型的FFN层来构建专家，但这种方法限制了专家的多样性。本文旨在利用多个不同预训练模型的专家来构建更强大的MoE模型。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）训练前阶段：通过层感知融合策略构建共享骨干网络，并使用基于激活的功能对齐缓解专家间参数不对齐问题；2）轻量级路由器训练阶段协调整个架构。

Conclusion: Symphony-MoE框架能够有效融合多个预训练模型的专家，构建出性能更优越的MoE模型，为解决专家多样性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable performance by activating
large parameter sets sparsely, minimizing computational overhead. To circumvent
the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs
upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its
feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert
diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This
paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using
experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained
models (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact
that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter
space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To
overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to
harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we
establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared
backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter
misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment.
Subsequently, a single lightweight stage of router training coordinates the
entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully
integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that
significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution
generalization.

Abstract: The meta-task of obtaining and aligning representations through contrastive
pretraining is steadily gaining importance since its introduction in CLIP and
ALIGN. In this paper we theoretically explain the advantages of synchronizing
with trainable inverse temperature and bias under the sigmoid loss, as
implemented in the recent SigLIP and SigLIP2 models of Google DeepMind.
Temperature and bias can drive the loss function to zero for a rich class of
configurations that we call $(\mathsf{m},
\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations. $(\mathsf{m},
\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations are a novel combinatorial object
related to spherical codes and are parametrized by a margin $\mathsf{m}$ and
relative bias $\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}}$. We use our characterization of
constellations to theoretically justify the success of SigLIP on retrieval, to
explain the modality gap present in SigLIP, and to identify the necessary
dimension for producing high-quality representations. Finally, we propose a
reparameterization of the sigmoid loss with explicit relative bias, which
improves training dynamics in experiments with synthetic data.

Abstract: Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multiple
etiologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal
dementia, and vascular dementia. Its clinical and biological heterogeneity
makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain
connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of
interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks
(XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based
learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant
biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent
insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review
dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and
multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for
dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models
in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited
generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open
problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically
meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.

TL;DR: 提出Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT)框架，通过多尺度交互拓扑结构实现多孔材料性能的准确预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多孔材料具有复杂的多尺度结构-性能关系，现有建模方法难以同时捕捉局部化学环境和全局孔隙网络拓扑，且标记数据稀疏分布不均，阻碍了跨材料家族的泛化能力

Method: 开发ITT框架，利用新型交互拓扑在多尺度（结构、元素、原子、成对元素组织）捕捉材料信息，通过Transformer架构集成尺度感知特征，采用两阶段训练策略：60万未标记结构的自监督预训练+监督微调

Result: ITT在吸附、传输和稳定性性能预测方面达到最先进水平，具有高准确性和可迁移性

Conclusion: 该框架为结构化学多样性多孔材料的学习引导发现提供了原则性和可扩展的路径

Abstract: Porous materials exhibit vast structural diversity and support critical
applications in gas storage, separations, and catalysis. However, predictive
modeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property
relationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical
environments and global pore-network topology. These complexities, combined
with sparse and unevenly distributed labeled data, hinder generalization across
material families. We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a
unified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to
capture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels,
including structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization.
ITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and
relational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them
through a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning
across scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised
pretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised
fine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable
predictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties. This framework
provides a principled and scalable path for learning-guided discovery in
structurally and chemically diverse porous materials.

TL;DR: 提出了DS-Diffusion模型，通过风格引导核和分层去噪机制解决现有扩散模型在时间序列生成中的条件引导重训练、分布偏差和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型需要为特定条件重新训练整个框架，生成数据与真实数据存在分布偏差，且推理过程不可解释。

Method: 开发基于风格引导核的扩散框架避免条件重训练，提出基于时间信息的分层去噪机制(THD)减少分布偏差，生成样本能清晰显示数据来源风格。

Result: 相比ImagenTime等SOTA模型，预测分数和判别分数分别降低5.56%和61.55%，分布偏差进一步减小，推理过程更可解释。

Conclusion: DS-Diffusion通过消除重训练需求增强了模型对特定条件的灵活性和适应性，同时提高了生成质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation
tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require
retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance.
There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated
data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream
tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces
leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we
propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the
DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed
to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based
hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the
distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore,
the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they
originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets
to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the
state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the
discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The
distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further
reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by
eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and
adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.

Method: 提出"Reflect before Act"（REBACT）方法，在采取下一个行动前引入关键的反思步骤，实现即时错误纠正和行动路径优化。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和TextCraft三个环境中，REBACT分别提升成功率6.72%（达98.51%）、24%（达61%）和0.5%（达99.5%），且计算效率高。

Conclusion: REBACT通过简单的反思机制有效解决了LLM决策中的错误累积问题，显著提升了决策性能，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interactive decision-making tasks, but existing methods often struggle with
error accumulation and lack robust self-correction mechanisms. We introduce
"Reflect before Act" (REBACT), a novel approach that enhances LLM-based
decision-making by introducing a critical reflect step prior to taking the next
action. This approach allows for immediate error correction, ensuring smooth
action path and adaptibity to environment feedback. We evaluate REBACT on three
diverse interactive environments: ALFWorld, WebShop, and TextCraft. Our results
demonstrate that REBACT significantly outperforms strong baselines, improving
success rates by up to 24% on WebShop (achieving 61%), 6.72% on ALFWorld
(achieving 98.51%), and 0.5% on TextCraft (achieving 99.5%) using
Claude3.5-sonnet as the underlying LLM. Further analysis reveals that REBACT's
performance improvements are achieved with only a few modification steps,
demonstrating its computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要基于确定性Transformer架构，缺乏生成灵活性，无法满足科学和工程应用中对不确定性建模的需求。

Method: 1. Flow Marching算法：联合采样噪声水平和物理时间步长，学习统一速度场；2. P2VAE：将物理状态嵌入紧凑潜在空间；3. FMT：结合扩散强迫方案和潜在时间金字塔，实现15倍计算效率提升。

Result: 在12个不同PDE家族的约250万轨迹上训练模型，在未见过的Kolmogorov湍流上表现出良好的少样本适应能力，长期滚动稳定性优于确定性模型，并能提供不确定性分层的集成结果。

Conclusion: 生成式PDE基础模型对于现实世界应用具有重要意义，Flow Marching方法在减少计算成本的同时实现了更好的生成灵活性和不确定性建模能力。

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale collections of PDE-governed spatiotemporal
trajectories has recently shown promise for building generalizable models of
dynamical systems. Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on
deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for
many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an
algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by
an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a
generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise
level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a
unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean
successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling uncertainty-aware
ensemble generations. Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a
Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states
into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT)
that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids,
achieving up to 15x greater computational efficiency than full-length video
diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially
reduced cost. We curate a corpus of ~2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE
families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream
evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot
adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic
counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting
the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.

TL;DR: HyperAdapt是一种参数高效微调方法，通过行列缩放矩阵实现高秩更新，仅需n+m个可训练参数，性能媲美全量微调但参数数量大幅减少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在多样化任务中表现出色，但适应专业应用通常需要微调，这种方法内存和计算成本高。参数高效微调方法通过仅更新小部分权重来缓解这个问题

Method: HyperAdapt通过应用行列缩放对角矩阵来适应预训练权重矩阵，从而诱导高秩更新。对于n×m矩阵，仅需n+m个可训练参数

Result: 在GLUE、算术推理和常识推理基准测试中，使用高达140亿参数的模型进行实验，HyperAdapt的性能与全量微调和其他先进PEFT方法相当或接近

Conclusion: HyperAdapt在保持高性能的同时，显著减少了可训练参数数量，为参数高效微调提供了新的有效方法

Abstract: Foundation models excel across diverse tasks, but adapting them to
specialized applications often requires fine-tuning, an approach that is memory
and compute-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate
this by updating only a small subset of weights. In this paper, we introduce
HyperAdapt, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that significantly reduces
the number of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods like
LoRA. Specifically, HyperAdapt adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by applying
row- and column-wise scaling through diagonal matrices, thereby inducing a
high-rank update while requiring only $n+m$ trainable parameters for an $n
\times m$ matrix. Theoretically, we establish an upper bound on the rank of
HyperAdapt's updates, and empirically, we confirm that it consistently induces
high-rank transformations across model layers. Experiments on GLUE, arithmetic
reasoning, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks with models up to 14B
parameters demonstrate that HyperAdapt matches or nearly matches the
performance of full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art PEFT methods while using
orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters.

Result: 在真实高光谱成像数据集上验证，相比现有方法具有更高的聚类精度和鲁棒性，特别是在高噪声和干扰下表现优异

Conclusion: 该框架在处理具有超越单个数据向量结构的高维应用方面展现出巨大潜力

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices
based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of
Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume
vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix
and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish
conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation
Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general
setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a
third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint
estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide
the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable
optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world
hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and
interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These
results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging
high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data
vectors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了广义双模拟度量（GBSM），用于计算不同马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）之间的状态相似性，解决了传统双模拟度量在多MDP场景下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统双模拟度量（BSM）在单个MDP内有效，但在多MDP场景（如策略迁移）中应用受限。现有方法缺乏严格的数学性质分析，限制了理论发展。

Method: 通过形式化定义GBSM，并严格证明其三个基本性质：对称性、跨MDP三角不等式和相同状态空间上的距离界限。

Result: GBSM在策略迁移、状态聚合和基于采样的估计方面获得了比标准BSM更紧的显式界限，并提供了闭式样本复杂度估计。

Conclusion: GBSM为多MDP场景提供了理论基础，数值结果验证了其有效性，优于现有的渐近结果。

Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state
similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states
closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been
successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state
representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP
scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has
attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis
of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In
this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM)
between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental
properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance
bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically
analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in
MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived
from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample
complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on
BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to e-commerce payment fraud detection by
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). By
framing transaction risk as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP), RL
optimizes risk detection across multiple payment stages. Crafting effective
reward functions, essential for RL model success, typically requires
significant human expertise due to the complexity and variability in design.
LLMs, with their advanced reasoning and coding capabilities, are well-suited to
refine these functions, offering improvements over traditional methods. Our
approach leverages LLMs to iteratively enhance reward functions, achieving
better fraud detection accuracy and demonstrating zero-shot capability.
Experiments with real-world data confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and
resilience of our LLM-enhanced RL framework through long-term evaluations,
underscoring the potential of LLMs in advancing industrial RL applications.

<details>

Motivation: 传统CNN在处理具有周期性结构的数据时存在局限性，特别是在图像分析、物理信息学习和材料科学等领域，数据往往具有高维脊状结构。本文旨在开发一种能够有效处理这类问题的神经网络架构。

Method: 设计了周期性CNN架构，在卷积层中引入周期性边界条件。通过严格的数学证明，建立了该架构能够逼近d维输入空间中d-1个线性变量脊函数的理论框架。

Result: 理论证明周期性CNN能够精确逼近高维脊函数，而在低维脊设置（d-2或更少变量）中这种逼近是不可能的，这为CNN的表达能力提供了精确的理论刻画。

Conclusion: 周期性CNN不仅扩展了CNN逼近理论的数学基础，而且为处理具有高维内在脊状结构的问题提供了一类具有实际应用价值的架构，在图像分析、物理学习和材料科学等领域具有重要应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce a novel convolutional neural network architecture, termed the
\emph{periodic CNN}, which incorporates periodic boundary conditions into the
convolutional layers. Our main theoretical contribution is a rigorous
approximation theorem: periodic CNNs can approximate ridge functions depending
on $d-1$ linear variables in a $d$-dimensional input space, while such
approximation is impossible in lower-dimensional ridge settings ($d-2$ or fewer
variables). This result establishes a sharp characterization of the expressive
power of periodic CNNs. Beyond the theory, our findings suggest that periodic
CNNs are particularly well-suited for problems where data naturally admits a
ridge-like structure of high intrinsic dimension, such as image analysis on
wrapped domains, physics-informed learning, and materials science. The work
thus both expands the mathematical foundation of CNN approximation theory and
highlights a class of architectures with surprising and practically relevant
approximation capabilities.

Result: 在23个单变量基准数据集上的实验表明，MOMEMTO在AUC和VUS指标上优于基线方法，特别是在少样本学习场景下显著提升了骨干TFM的性能。

Conclusion: MOMEMTO通过有效的记忆模块设计成功缓解了时间序列异常检测中的过度泛化问题，实现了多数据集上的高效联合学习，为时间序列基础模型在异常检测任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time
series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability
increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen
anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by
incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns.
Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to
be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection,
enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The
memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from
multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across
multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes
memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes
them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We
evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on
AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the
performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: 对角线性网络的训练轨迹与lasso正则化路径密切相关，训练时间相当于逆正则化参数。

Abstract: Diagonal linear networks are neural networks with linear activation and
diagonal weight matrices. Their theoretical interest is that their implicit
regularization can be rigorously analyzed: from a small initialization, the
training of diagonal linear networks converges to the linear predictor with
minimal 1-norm among minimizers of the training loss. In this paper, we deepen
this analysis showing that the full training trajectory of diagonal linear
networks is closely related to the lasso regularization path. In this
connection, the training time plays the role of an inverse regularization
parameter. Both rigorous results and simulations are provided to illustrate
this conclusion. Under a monotonicity assumption on the lasso regularization
path, the connection is exact while in the general case, we show an approximate
connection.

where it uses historical data
  to capture systems behavior, bypassing the need for high-fidelity physical
models.
  However, despite their competence in prediction tasks, these models often
struggle with
  the evaluation of their confidence. This matter is particularly
  important in consistency-based diagnosis where decision logic is highly
sensitive to false alarms.
  To address this challenge, this work presents a diagnostic framework that
uses
  ensemble probabilistic machine learning to
  improve diagnostic characteristics of data driven consistency based diagnosis
  by quantifying and automating the prediction uncertainty.
  The proposed method is evaluated across several case studies using both
ablation
  and comparative analyses, showing consistent improvements across a range of
diagnostic metrics.

Abstract: Data assimilation is widely used in many disciplines such as meteorology,
oceanography, and robotics to estimate the state of a dynamical system from
noisy observations. In this work, we propose a lightweight and general method
to perform data assimilation using diffusion models pre-trained for emulating
dynamical systems. Our method builds on particle filters, a class of data

guiding example throughout this work, we illustrate our methodology on GenCast,
a diffusion-based model that generates global ensemble weather forecasts.

*Wenlong Lyu,Yuheng Jia,Hui Liu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的低秩双随机聚类方法（LoRD）及其改进版本B-LoRD，通过减少对正交约束的松弛来提升聚类效果，并证明了在双随机约束下正交性与块对角性的等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图的聚类方法（如谱聚类、对称非负矩阵分解等）过度松弛了低秩、非负、双随机和正交约束，这可能限制了它们的聚类效果。

Method: 提出LoRD模型，仅松弛正交约束以获得概率聚类结果；进一步引入块对角正则化（B-LoRD），通过最大化Frobenius范数来增强聚类性能；将非凸双随机约束转化为线性凸约束，并提出全局收敛的投影梯度下降算法。

Result: 理论分析证明了正交性与块对角性的等价关系，以及LoRD和B-LoRD的梯度Lipschitz连续性；大量实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LoRD和B-LoRD通过更少的约束松弛和块对角正则化，显著提升了聚类性能，为图基聚类方法提供了新的理论框架和实用算法。

Abstract: The well-known graph-based clustering methods, including spectral clustering,
symmetric non-negative matrix factorization, and doubly stochastic
normalization, can be viewed as relaxations of the kernel $k$-means approach.
However, we posit that these methods excessively relax their inherent low-rank,
nonnegative, doubly stochastic, and orthonormal constraints to ensure numerical
feasibility, potentially limiting their clustering efficacy. In this paper,
guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose \textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank
\textbf{D}oubly stochastic clustering (\textbf{LoRD}), a model that only
relaxes the orthonormal constraint to derive a probabilistic clustering
results. Furthermore, we theoretically establish the equivalence between
orthogonality and block diagonality under the doubly stochastic constraint. By
integrating \textbf{B}lock diagonal regularization into LoRD, expressed as the
maximization of the Frobenius norm, we propose \textbf{B-LoRD}, which further
enhances the clustering performance. To ensure numerical solvability, we
transform the non-convex doubly stochastic constraint into a linear convex
constraint through the introduction of a class probability parameter. We
further theoretically demonstrate the gradient Lipschitz continuity of our LoRD
and B-LoRD enables the proposal of a globally convergent projected gradient
descent algorithm for their optimization. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approaches. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lwl-learning/LoRD.

TL;DR: 提出Shared-Weights Extender (SWE)和Steepest Voting Distributor (SVoD)两种方法，用于在训练过程中扩展神经网络时防止新神经元失效，实现更好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在训练过程中扩展神经网络是一种有前景的方法，可以增加网络容量而无需从头训练更大的模型。但新添加的神经元往往无法适应已训练的网络而变得不活跃，无法为容量增长做出贡献。

Method: SWE方法通过将新神经元与现有神经元耦合来实现平滑集成，防止新神经元失效；SVoD是一种基于梯度的神经元分配方法，用于在深度网络扩展时跨层分配神经元。

Result: 在四个数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，该方法能有效抑制神经元不活跃现象，相比其他扩展方法和基线实现了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效解决神经网络扩展过程中新神经元失效的问题，为网络容量增长提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Expanding neural networks during training is a promising way to augment
capacity without retraining larger models from scratch. However, newly added
neurons often fail to adjust to a trained network and become inactive,
providing no contribution to capacity growth. We propose the Shared-Weights
Extender (SWE), a novel method explicitly designed to prevent inactivity of new
neurons by coupling them with existing ones for smooth integration. In
parallel, we introduce the Steepest Voting Distributor (SVoD), a gradient-based
method for allocating neurons across layers during deep network expansion. Our
extensive benchmarking on four datasets shows that our method can effectively
suppress neuron inactivity and achieve better performance compared to other
expanding methods and baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在处理完全正确或完全错误的响应组时存在学习信号丢失的问题，特别是在完全错误的组中优势函数为零，导致梯度消失。

Method: NGRPO引入优势校准机制，假设存在虚拟最大奖励样本，改变组内奖励的均值和方差；采用非对称裁剪，放松正样本的更新幅度，严格限制负样本的更新。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型上的实验表明，NGRPO在MATH500、AMC23和AIME2025等数学基准上显著优于PPO、GRPO、DAPO和PSR-NSR等基线方法。

Conclusion: NGRPO能够从同质错误中学习，实现数学推理能力的稳定和显著提升。

Abstract: RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
across various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers
from a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either
entirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these
homogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously
incorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero,
leading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To
overcome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy
Optimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust
learning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism
hypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage
calculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group
and ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no
longer zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the
update magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on
that of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure
introduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B
demonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO,
DAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and
AIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous
errors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical
reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/nangongrui-ngr/NGRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然异质性在节点级任务中已被广泛研究，但其对图级任务的影响尚不清楚。本文旨在填补这一空白，建立图级学习中异质性的理论理解。

Method: 引入图级标注方案的分类法，重点关注局部结构标注中的motif任务；使用基于能量的梯度流分析揭示motif检测需要混合频率动态；在合成数据集和真实分子属性预测数据集上进行实验验证。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了图级学习中异质性的新理论理解，并为设计有效的GNN架构提供了指导，强调需要频率自适应而非频率主导的方法。

Abstract: While heterophily has been widely studied in node-level tasks, its impact on
graph-level tasks remains unclear. We present the first analysis of heterophily
in graph-level learning, combining theoretical insights with empirical
validation. We first introduce a taxonomy of graph-level labeling schemes, and
focus on motif-based tasks within local structure labeling, which is a popular
labeling scheme. Using energy-based gradient flow analysis, we reveal a key
insight: unlike frequency-dominated regimes in node-level tasks, motif
detection requires mixed-frequency dynamics to remain flexible across multiple
spectral components. Our theory shows that motif objectives are inherently
misaligned with global frequency dominance, demanding distinct architectural
considerations. Experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled heterophily
and real-world molecular property prediction support our findings, showing that
frequency-adaptive model outperform frequency-dominated models. This work
establishes a new theoretical understanding of heterophily in graph-level
learning and offers guidance for designing effective GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态优化后门触发器的方法，通过最小最大框架将后门任务与主任务解耦，提高了联邦学习中的后门攻击持久性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的分布式特性暴露了新的攻击面，现有后门攻击依赖固定模式或对抗性扰动作为触发器，导致后门任务与主任务紧密耦合，容易被诚实更新稀释且在联邦防御下持久性有限。

Method: 采用最小最大框架动态优化后门触发器：内层最大化中毒样本与良性样本的性能差距，确保良性用户更新对后门影响最小；外层将自适应触发器注入本地模型。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言任务上评估，与六种后门攻击方法和六种防御算法比较，实验结果显示该方法攻击性能良好且易于集成到现有后门攻击技术中。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态优化触发器实现了后门任务与主任务的解耦，显著提升了联邦学习环境下后门攻击的持久性和有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a
central model without sharing their private data. However, this distributed
nature also exposes new attack surfaces. In particular, backdoor attacks allow
attackers to implant malicious behaviors into the global model while
maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. Existing attacks usually rely on
fixed patterns or adversarial perturbations as triggers, which tightly couple
the main and backdoor tasks. This coupling makes them vulnerable to dilution by
honest updates and limits their persistence under federated defenses. In this
work, we propose an approach to decouple the backdoor task from the main task
by dynamically optimizing the backdoor trigger within a min-max framework. The
inner layer maximizes the performance gap between poisoned and benign samples,
ensuring that the contributions of benign users have minimal impact on the
backdoor. The outer process injects the adaptive triggers into the local model.
We evaluate our method on both computer vision and natural language tasks, and
compare it with six backdoor attack methods under six defense algorithms.
Experimental results show that our method achieves good attack performance and
can be easily integrated into existing backdoor attack techniques.

Motivation: 传统神经算法推理存在无法构建有效解、无法处理多个正确解、在NP难问题上表现差、以及缺乏专家算法时无法应用等局限性。

Method: 将算法轨迹学习问题构建为马尔可夫决策过程，提出GNARL框架，结合模仿学习和强化学习方法，适用于广泛的图基问题。

Result: 在多个CLRS-30问题上获得极高的图精度，在NP难问题上性能匹配或超越更窄的NAR方法，甚至在缺乏专家算法时也能应用。

Conclusion: GNARL框架成功解决了传统NAR方法的局限性，为算法学习提供了更通用和强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) is a paradigm that trains neural networks
to execute classic algorithms by supervised learning. Despite its successes,
important limitations remain: inability to construct valid solutions without
post-processing and to reason about multiple correct ones, poor performance on
combinatorial NP-hard problems, and inapplicability to problems for which
strong algorithms are not yet known. To address these limitations, we reframe
the problem of learning algorithm trajectories as a Markov Decision Process,
which imposes structure on the solution construction procedure and unlocks the
powerful tools of imitation and reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the
GNARL framework, encompassing the methodology to translate problem formulations
from NAR to RL and a learning architecture suitable for a wide range of
graph-based problems. We achieve very high graph accuracy results on several
CLRS-30 problems, performance matching or exceeding much narrower NAR
approaches for NP-hard problems and, remarkably, applicability even when
lacking an expert algorithm.

Conclusion: 信度网络为开发隐私感知的概率图模型提供了一种原则性、实用且有效的方法，能够在隐私保护和模型效用之间实现良好平衡。

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable
efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective
across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The
structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly
learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes
increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive
information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize
privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine
the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals
belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection
tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this
offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the
model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the
resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of
releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks
(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After
adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the
masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful
attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve
meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key
learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from
recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical
experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN
hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical,
and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic
graphical models.

Conclusion: HEROS框架和ζ策略为绿色在线学习提供了有效解决方案，在性能和资源效率之间实现了良好平衡

Abstract: Ensemble methods for stream mining necessitate managing multiple models and
updating them as data distributions evolve. Considering the calls for more
sustainability, established methods are however not sufficiently considerate of
ensemble members' computational expenses and instead overly focus on predictive
capabilities. To address these challenges and enable green online learning, we
propose heterogeneous online ensembles (HEROS). For every training step, HEROS
chooses a subset of models from a pool of models initialized with diverse
hyperparameter choices under resource constraints to train. We introduce a
Markov decision process to theoretically capture the trade-offs between
predictive performance and sustainability constraints. Based on this framework,
we present different policies for choosing which models to train on incoming
data. Most notably, we propose the novel $\zeta$-policy, which focuses on
training near-optimal models at reduced costs. Using a stochastic model, we
theoretically prove that our $\zeta$-policy achieves near optimal performance
while using fewer resources compared to the best performing policy. In our
experiments across 11 benchmark datasets, we find empiric evidence that our
$\zeta$-policy is a strong contribution to the state-of-the-art, demonstrating
highly accurate performance, in some cases even outperforming competitors, and
simultaneously being much more resource-friendly.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SNN虽然理论上具有高能效，但在实际推理中需要计算时间衰减函数和突触权重乘法，这些数字操作成本高昂，导致能效优势难以实现。

Method: 利用氧化铟光电突触设备的自然物理衰减实现时间函数，将模拟输出作为突触权重和时间衰减的融合产物；开发量化神经网络到SNN的转换算法，支持复杂架构如Transformer。

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的高能效SNN范式，将基础设备物理直接转化为强大的计算原语，所有代码和数据均已开源。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise high energy efficiency, particularly
with time-to-first-spike (TTFS) encoding, which maximizes sparsity by emitting
at most one spike per neuron. However, such energy advantage is often
unrealized because inference requires evaluating a temporal decay function and
subsequent multiplication with the synaptic weights. This paper challenges this
costly approach by repurposing a physical hardware `bug', namely, the natural
signal decay in optoelectronic devices, as the core computation of TTFS. We
fabricated a custom indium oxide optoelectronic synapse, showing how its
natural physical decay directly implements the required temporal function. By
treating the device's analog output as the fused product of the synaptic weight
and temporal decay, optoelectronic synaptic TTFS (named Otters) eliminates
these expensive digital operations. To use the Otters paradigm in complex
architectures like the transformer, which are challenging to train directly due
to the sparsity issue, we introduce a novel quantized neural network-to-SNN
conversion algorithm. This complete hardware-software co-design enables our
model to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across seven GLUE benchmark datasets
and demonstrates a 1.77$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over previous
leading SNNs, based on a comprehensive analysis of compute, data movement, and
memory access costs using energy measurements from a commercial 22nm process.
Our work thus establishes a new paradigm for energy-efficient SNNs, translating
fundamental device physics directly into powerful computational primitives. All
codes and data are open source.

Result: SGNNs能够恢复潜在参数，在失配情况下保持鲁棒性，在模型选择任务中表现优于经典工具（如AIC）。

Conclusion: SGNNs为数据受限场景下的科学预测提供了一个原则性和实用的框架。

Abstract: Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained
entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or
unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
  We present the foundational theory of simulation-grounded learning. We show
that SGNNs implement amortized Bayesian inference under a simulation prior and
converge to the Bayes-optimal predictor. We derive generalization bounds under
model misspecification and prove that SGNNs can learn unobservable scientific
quantities that empirical methods provably cannot. We also formalize a novel
form of mechanistic interpretability uniquely enabled by SGNNs: by attributing
predictions to the simulated mechanisms that generated them, SGNNs yield
posterior-consistent, scientifically grounded explanations.
  We provide numerical experiments to validate all theoretical predictions.
SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform
classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC
in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a
principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited
regimes.

Abstract: Low-rank architectures have become increasingly important for efficient large
language model (LLM) pre-training, providing substantial reductions in both
parameter complexity and memory/computational demands. Despite these
advantages, current low-rank methods face three critical shortcomings: (1)
compromised model performance, (2) considerable computational overhead, and (3)
limited activation memory savings. To address these limitations, we propose
Cross-layer Low-Rank residual Network (CR-Net), an innovative
parameter-efficient framework inspired by our discovery that inter-layer
activation residuals possess low-rank properties. CR-Net implements this
insight through a dual-path architecture that efficiently reconstructs layer
activations by combining previous-layer outputs with their low-rank
differences, thereby maintaining high-rank information with minimal parameters.
We further develop a specialized activation recomputation strategy tailored for
CR-Net that dramatically reduces memory requirements. Extensive pre-training
experiments across model scales from 60M to 7B parameters demonstrate that
CR-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank frameworks while
requiring fewer computational resources and less memory.

Abstract: Representation learning from unlabeled data has been extensively studied in
statistics, data science and signal processing with a rich literature on
techniques for dimension reduction, compression, multi-dimensional scaling
among others. However, current deep learning models use new principles for
unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using
classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous
success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which
effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data.
However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by
these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks
or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine
mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an
overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from

*Hazem Dewidar,Elena Umili*

Main category: cs.LG

Abstract: Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks present significant
challenges, as agents must reason over entire trajectories of state-action
pairs to make optimal decisions. A common strategy to address this is through
symbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which
provide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However,
these approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the
availability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw
observations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the
temporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural
Reward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton
end-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore
as easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more
explainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore,
we show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL,
our method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs).

*Teng Xiao,Zuchao Li,Lefei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniBridge是一个统一的多模态框架，支持视觉语言理解、生成和检索任务，采用语言中心设计和轻量级双向潜在对齐模块，通过两阶段解耦训练策略实现多模态建模的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型解决方案往往孤立处理不同任务或需要从头训练，导致计算成本高且跨模态泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用语言中心设计重用预训练LLM，引入轻量级双向潜在对齐模块，提出两阶段解耦训练策略：监督微调和潜在空间对齐，以及语义引导的扩散训练。

Result: 在广泛基准测试中，OmniBridge在所有三个任务上均达到竞争性或最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 潜在空间对齐在共享表示空间下统一多模态建模方面具有有效性，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to
significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks.
However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require
training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited
generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a
unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language
understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture.
OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and
introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the
challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM
behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to
align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge
achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks.
Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for
unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and
models are released at https://github.com/xiao-xt/OmniBridge.

### [394] [Improving Credit Card Fraud Detection through Transformer-Enhanced GAN Oversampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19032)
*Kashaf Ul Emaan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer编码器的GAN混合方法，用于生成高质量的信用卡欺诈交易样本，以解决数据集高度不平衡的问题，相比传统方法在召回率、F1分数和AUC指标上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信用卡欺诈检测面临数据集高度不平衡的挑战，传统过采样方法如SMOTE生成的合成样本过于简单，而现有生成模型如CTGAN和TVAE在高维依赖建模方面仍存在问题。

Method: 采用生成对抗网络与Transformer编码器块的混合架构，GAN通过对抗训练生成真实样本，Transformer通过自注意力机制学习丰富的特征交互，克服了SMOTE、CTGAN和TVAE的局限性。

Result: 在公开的信用卡欺诈检测数据集上测试，与多种分类器结合，相比传统和生成重采样方法，在召回率、F1分数和AUC指标上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的GAN方法能有效解决欺诈检测中的类别不平衡问题，生成高质量的少数类样本，提升检测性能。

Abstract: Detection of credit card fraud is an acute issue of financial security
because transaction datasets are highly lopsided, with fraud cases being only a
drop in the ocean. Balancing datasets using the most popular methods of
traditional oversampling such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE) generally create simplistic synthetic samples that are not readily
applicable to complex fraud patterns. Recent industry advances that include
Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and Tabular
Variational Autoencoders (TVAE) have demonstrated increased efficiency in
tabular synthesis, yet all these models still exhibit issues with
high-dimensional dependence modelling. Now we will present our hybrid approach
where we use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Transformer encoder
block to produce realistic fraudulent transactions samples. The GAN
architecture allows training realistic generators adversarial, and the
Transformer allows the model to learn rich feature interactions by
self-attention. Such a hybrid strategy overcomes the limitations of SMOTE,
CTGAN, and TVAE by producing a variety of high-quality synthetic minority
classes samples. We test our algorithm on the publicly-available Credit Card
Fraud Detection dataset and compare it to conventional and generative
resampling strategies with a variety of classifiers, such as Logistic
Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and
Support Vector Machine (SVM). Findings indicate that our Transformer-based GAN
shows substantial gains in Recall, F1-score and Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which indicates that it is effective in
overcoming the severe class imbalance inherent in the task of fraud detection.

*Yang Li,Chenyu Wang,Tingrui Wang,Yongwei Wang,Haonan Li,Zhunga Liu,Quan Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JAD是一个基于潜在扩散模型的黑盒对抗攻击框架，通过联合注意力蒸馏策略实现跨架构的对抗样本生成，提高了攻击泛化性和生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有黑盒对抗攻击方法依赖特定网络架构、查询次数多、跨架构迁移性差的问题。

Method: 利用潜在扩散模型，通过从CNN和ViT模型中提取的注意力图指导生成对抗样本，聚焦于跨架构敏感的图像区域。

Result: 实验表明JAD在攻击泛化性、生成效率和跨架构迁移性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JAD为黑盒对抗攻击提供了一个有前景的有效范式，具有架构无关性和高效性。

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to
model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network
architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited
cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these
limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box
adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent
diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on
image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach
crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different
model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be
architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse
models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high
adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative
queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack
generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability
compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for
black-box adversarial attacks.

### [396] [Beyond Backpropagation: Exploring Innovative Algorithms for Energy-Efficient Deep Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19063)
*Przemysław Spyra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了三种无反向传播训练方法（FF、CaFo、MF），发现MF算法在MLP架构上不仅精度超过BP，还能降低41%能耗和34%训练时间，为可持续AI发展提供了数据驱动的路线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的计算和能耗需求不断增长，主要受反向传播驱动，这挑战了可持续AI发展。需要探索更高效的训练方法。

Method: 建立了稳健的比较框架：在原生架构上实现三种BP-free算法（FF和MF用MLP，CaFo用CNN），与等效BP模型对比。使用Optuna优化超参数，基于验证性能应用一致的早停标准。

Result: MF在MLP分类精度上不仅与BP竞争且持续超越，验证损失收敛到更优最小值。硬件层面测量显示MF降低能耗41%，缩短训练时间34%，碳足迹显著减小。

Conclusion: MF算法实现了精度与可持续性的平衡，挑战了全局优化必要性的假设，为未来能效深度学习提供了清晰的数据驱动路线图。

Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of deep neural networks (DNNs),
driven largely by backpropagation (BP), challenge sustainable AI development.
This paper rigorously investigates three BP-free training methods: the
Forward-Forward (FF), Cascaded-Forward (CaFo), and Mono-Forward (MF)
algorithms, tracing their progression from foundational concepts to a
demonstrably superior solution.
  A robust comparative framework was established: each algorithm was
implemented on its native architecture (MLPs for FF and MF, a CNN for CaFo) and
benchmarked against an equivalent BP-trained model. Hyperparameters were
optimized with Optuna, and consistent early stopping criteria were applied
based on validation performance, ensuring all models were optimally tuned
before comparison.
  Results show that MF not only competes with but consistently surpasses BP in
classification accuracy on its native MLPs. Its superior generalization stems
from converging to a more favorable minimum in the validation loss landscape,
challenging the assumption that global optimization is required for
state-of-the-art results. Measured at the hardware level using the NVIDIA
Management Library (NVML) API, MF reduces energy consumption by up to 41% and
shortens training time by up to 34%, translating to a measurably smaller carbon
footprint as estimated by CodeCarbon.
  Beyond this primary result, we present a hardware-level analysis that
explains the efficiency gains: exposing FF's architectural inefficiencies,
validating MF's computationally lean design, and challenging the assumption
that all BP-free methods are inherently more memory-efficient. By documenting
the evolution from FF's conceptual groundwork to MF's synthesis of accuracy and
sustainability, this work offers a clear, data-driven roadmap for future
energy-efficient deep learning.

*Jian Xu,Qibin Zhao,John Paisley,Delu Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了DBVI方法，通过可学习的、数据依赖的初始分布改进DDVI，提高深度高斯过程的变分推断效率和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDVI方法使用固定的无条件起始分布，与真实后验分布差距较大，导致推断轨迹效率低下和收敛缓慢。

Method: DBVI从可学习的、数据依赖的初始分布开始反向扩散过程，通过摊销神经网络参数化初始化，并使用ELBO目标的梯度逐步适应，减少后验差距。网络设计为在诱导输入上操作，实现可扩展的摊销。

Result: 在回归、分类和图像重建任务中，DBVI在预测精度、收敛速度和后验质量方面一致优于DDVI和其他变分基线方法。

Conclusion: DBVI在保持DDVI数学优雅性的同时，通过扩散桥过程显著改进了深度高斯过程的变分推断性能。

Abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian
modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially
over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI)
addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a
simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting
distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in
inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we
propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension
of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent
initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized
neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO
objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To
enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing
inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and
naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the
mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time
SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We
derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI
for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification,
and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other
variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior
quality.

*Asela Hevapathige*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AxelGNN是一种新颖的图神经网络架构，基于Axelrod文化传播模型，通过相似性门控概率交互、特征级复制机制和全局极化保持来解决GNN的过平滑、异质关系处理和特征灵活性限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GNN的三个基本限制：深层网络中的特征过平滑导致节点表示难以区分、难以有效处理连接节点差异显著的异质关系、将整个特征向量作为不可分割单元处理限制了灵活性。

Method: 提出AxelGNN架构，采用相似性门控概率交互自适应促进收敛或发散、实现特征级复制机制进行细粒度特征聚合、保持全局极化以维持节点在不同表示簇中的独特性。

Result: 在节点分类和影响力估计基准测试中，AxelGNN在不同同质性-异质性特征的图结构上始终优于或匹配最先进的GNN方法。

Conclusion: AxelGNN的双稳态收敛动力学自然处理同质性和异质性图，在单一架构内统一解决GNN的多个基本限制。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations:
feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become
indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage
heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and
they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits
flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel
GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that
addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates
similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence
or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying
mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and
maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple
representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally
handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture.
Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation
benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying
homophily-heterophily characteristics.

Motivation: 解决多臂老虎机问题中如何有效利用来自相关但不同分布的源样本进行迁移学习，当源分布和目标分布存在已知距离约束时的优化问题。

Method: 首先推导了包含迁移参数的问题依赖渐近遗憾下界，然后提出了KL-UCB-Transfer索引策略，该策略在高斯情况下匹配了新的下界。

Result: 理论分析表明KL-UCB-Transfer算法能够达到渐近最优性能，仿真验证显示当源分布和目标分布足够接近时，该算法显著优于无先验基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为多臂老虎机问题的迁移学习提供了理论框架和实用算法，证明了在源目标分布接近时利用源样本的有效性。

Abstract: We study the non-contextual multi-armed bandit problem in a transfer learning
setting: before any pulls, the learner is given N'_k i.i.d. samples from each
source distribution nu'_k, and the true target distributions nu_k lie within a
known distance bound d_k(nu_k, nu'_k) <= L_k. In this framework, we first
derive a problem-dependent asymptotic lower bound on cumulative regret that
extends the classical Lai-Robbins result to incorporate the transfer parameters
(d_k, L_k, N'_k). We then propose KL-UCB-Transfer, a simple index policy that
matches this new bound in the Gaussian case. Finally, we validate our approach
via simulations, showing that KL-UCB-Transfer significantly outperforms the
no-prior baseline when source and target distributions are sufficiently close.

Abstract: Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical
applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against
adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we
discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable
robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in
computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training
paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of
domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to
generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test
distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art
generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image
classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language
models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that
elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses,
which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based
agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-REBEL是一种鲁棒的离线RLHF方法，通过Wasserstein、KL和χ²模糊集解决奖励错误规范和过优化问题，在保持可扩展性的同时实现最优参数率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离线RLHF方法存在过优化问题，模型会过度拟合奖励错误规范并偏离训练期间观察到的偏好行为。

Method: 提出DRO-REBEL统一框架，使用Fenchel对偶将更新简化为相对奖励回归，避免PPO式裁剪和辅助价值网络，并推导出三种散度的实用SGD算法。

Result: 在Emotion Alignment、ArmoRM多目标基准和HH-Alignment上的实验表明，该方法在未见偏好混合、模型大小和数据规模上具有强鲁棒性，χ²-REBEL表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究验证了无免费午餐权衡：半径收缩快于经验散度集中率可获得最优参数率但丧失覆盖保证，而保证覆盖的半径则导致较慢的收敛率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become crucial for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, existing
offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to
reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during
training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with
type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality,
each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving
scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under
standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage
condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants
than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$
rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes
the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal
parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences:
gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast
1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale
ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong
worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data
scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance.
A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii
shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve
minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while
coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.

Motivation: 理解事件序列中的因果关系对于医疗保健、车辆诊断等领域至关重要，但目前仍是一个未解决的挑战，特别是在处理包含数千种事件类型的高维稀疏序列时。

Method: 使用两个预训练的因果Transformer作为领域特定的基础模型，并行处理每个序列的单次因果图推断，然后通过自适应频率融合聚合这些图来重建标签的全局马尔可夫边界。

Result: 在包含29,100个独特事件类型和474个不平衡标签的真实世界汽车故障预测数据集上，CARGO展示了执行结构化推理的能力。

Conclusion: CARGO的两阶段方法能够在避免完整数据集条件独立性测试的高成本的同时，实现大规模的高效概率推理。

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as
diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error
codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like
healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label
causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising
of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as
domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in
parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an
adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of
labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at
scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional
independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault
prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced
labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
privacy-preserving model training, yet deployments in sensitive domains such as
healthcare face persistent challenges from non-IID data, client unreliability,
and adversarial manipulation. This paper introduces FedFiTS, a trust and
fairness-aware selective FL framework that advances the FedFaSt line by
combining fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation. FedFiTS
implements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural
selection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client
scoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance
convergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis
establishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard
assumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions
relative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical
imaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular
agricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently
outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and
resilience to poisoning attacks. By integrating trust-aware aggregation with
fairness-oriented client selection, FedFiTS advances scalable and secure FL,
making it well suited for real-world healthcare and cross-domain deployments.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型的架构和参数特征，特别是权重特征，以分析模型间的相关性和差异。

Method: 提出标准差向量（假设权重服从正态分布，对投影矩阵标准差进行归一化）和聚类向量（使用K-Means算法对奇异值进行分组）来描述模型特征。

Result: 两种向量能有效区分不同模型，清晰显示同家族模型的相似性。LoRA微调后，标准差向量受数据集影响，聚类向量保持与预训练模型的一致性。

Conclusion: 标准差向量和聚类向量是分析大语言模型权重特征的有效工具，能揭示模型间的差异和相关性，对模型理解和优化具有重要意义。

Abstract: The study on architecture and parameter characteristics remains the hot topic
in the research of large language models. In this paper we concern with the
characteristics of weight which are used to analyze the correlations and
differences between models. Two kinds of vectors-standard deviation vector and
clustering vector-are proposed to describe features of models. In the first
case, the weights are assumed to follow normal distribution. The standard
deviation values of projection matrices are normalized to form
Standard-Deviation Vector, representing the distribution characteristics of
models. In the second case, the singular values from each weight projection
matrix are extracted and grouped by K-Means algorithm. The grouped data with
the same type matrix are combined as Clustering Vector to represent the
correlation characteristics of models' weights. The study reveals that these
two vectors can effectively distinguish between different models and clearly
show the similarities among models of the same family. Moreover, after
conducting LoRA fine-tuning with different datasets and models, it is found
that the distribution of weights represented by standard deviation vector is
directly influenced by the dataset, but the correlations between different
weights represented by clustering vector remain unaffected and maintain a high
consistency with the pre-trained model.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling
these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the
difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating
stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces
PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between
hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs
concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by
the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation
engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the
generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator
utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on
long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL
achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL
baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and
modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key
contribution.

TL;DR: GSTM-HMU是一个生成式时空框架，通过显式建模人类移动的语义和时间复杂性来推进移动性分析。该框架包含四个关键创新：时空概念编码器、认知轨迹记忆、生活方式概念库和任务导向生成头。在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该模型在三个基准任务上均优于强基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动轨迹记录了签到序列，为研究短期访问模式和持久生活方式规律提供了独特窗口。现有方法未能充分建模移动数据的语义和时间复杂性，需要更先进的生成式框架来提取语义规律。

Result: 在Gowalla、WeePlace、Brightkite和FourSquare四个数据集上的实验显示，GSTM-HMU在三个基准任务（下一位置预测、轨迹-用户识别和时间估计）上均取得一致且显著的性能提升，优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 生成式建模为构建更鲁棒、可解释和可泛化的人类移动智能系统提供了有前景的基础。GSTM-HMU框架有效提取了复杂移动数据中的语义规律，证明了其在移动分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a
unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle
regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal
framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the
semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of
four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE)
integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal
rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory
Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and
behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively.
Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference
cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance
interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads
transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream
tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world
datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate
performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user
identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and
substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of
GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond
raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling
provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and
generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a significant challenge for efficient
reinforcement learning for decades (Ring 1994, Rivest and Precup 2003). While
recent works have proposed effective methods to mitigate this issue, they
mainly focus on the algorithmic side. Meanwhile, we do not fully understand
what architectural properties of neural networks lead to catastrophic
forgetting. This study aims to fill this gap by studying the role of activation
functions in the training dynamics of neural networks and their impact on
catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning setup. Our study reveals
that, besides sparse representations, the gradient sparsity of activation
functions also plays an important role in reducing forgetting. Based on this
insight, we propose a new class of activation functions, elephant activation
functions, that can generate both sparse outputs and sparse gradients. We show
that by simply replacing classical activation functions with elephant
activation functions in the neural networks of value-based algorithms, we can
significantly improve the resilience of neural networks to catastrophic
forgetting, thus making reinforcement learning more sample-efficient and
memory-efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了功能缩放定律（FSL），通过随机梯度下降的随机微分方程建模，刻画了学习率调度对LLM预训练过程中损失动态的影响，为优化大规模模型训练提供了理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要关注最终损失，忽略了训练过程中的损失动态和学习率调度的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，深入理解LLM预训练的动态特性。

Method: 使用师生核回归设置，通过在线随机梯度下降训练，引入内在时间视角和随机微分方程建模，提出功能缩放定律（FSL）来表征训练过程中总体风险演化。

Result: FSL成功捕捉了不同学习率调度的影响，理论验证了LLM预训练中的经验实践，如高容量模型更高效、学习率衰减提升效率、WSD调度优于直接衰减调度等。

Conclusion: FSL框架能够加深对LLM预训练动态的理解，为改进大规模模型训练提供理论依据和实践指导，在0.1B到1B参数规模的实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Scaling laws have played a cornerstone role in guiding the training of large
language models (LLMs). However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily
focus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training
process and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this
paper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel
regression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
Leveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential
equation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL),
which characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training
process for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured
through an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects
fully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used
LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under
both data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical
justification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such
as (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)
learning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules
can outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical
relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing
the loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model
sizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen
the understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for
improving large-scale model training.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的鲁棒性验证方法，通过从训练数据中提取"弱鲁棒"样本来评估模型对对抗性和常见损坏扰动的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习分类器在干净数据集上表现良好，但对对抗性和常见损坏扰动非常脆弱，传统方法依赖扰动测试数据集来评估鲁棒性，但这种方法不够敏感和早期。

Method: 通过局部鲁棒性分析直接从训练数据集中提取最容易受到扰动的"弱鲁棒"样本，这些样本作为模型脆弱性的早期敏感指标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上的实验证明，基于弱鲁棒样本的鲁棒性验证方法能够有效指导模型在对抗性和常见损坏场景下的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种更细致的鲁棒性理解方式，能够有针对性地提高模型在扰动环境下的可靠性。

Abstract: Data-driven models, especially deep learning classifiers often demonstrate
great success on clean datasets. Yet, they remain vulnerable to common data
distortions such as adversarial and common corruption perturbations. These
perturbations can significantly degrade performance, thereby challenging the
overall reliability of the models. Traditional robustness validation typically
relies on perturbed test datasets to assess and improve model performance. In
our framework, however, we propose a validation approach that extracts "weak
robust" samples directly from the training dataset via local robustness
analysis. These samples, being the most susceptible to perturbations, serve as
an early and sensitive indicator of the model's vulnerabilities. By evaluating
models on these challenging training instances, we gain a more nuanced
understanding of its robustness, which informs targeted performance
enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on models trained
with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, highlighting how robustness validation
guided by weak robust samples can drive meaningful improvements in model
reliability under adversarial and common corruption scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedFusion是一个联邦迁移学习框架，通过统一域适应和节俭标注技术，结合多样性/聚类感知编码器，解决联邦学习中的异构特征空间、非IID数据和标签稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际联邦学习中的三个关键挑战：异构特征空间、严重的非IID数据和跨客户端的标签稀缺问题。

Method: 使用标记的教师客户端通过置信度过滤的伪标签和域自适应迁移指导学习者客户端，同时客户端维护针对本地数据的个性化编码器。采用相似性加权分类器耦合（可选聚类平均）来保持全局一致性。

Result: 在表格和图像基准测试中，FedFusion在IID、非IID和标签稀缺情况下，在准确性、鲁棒性和公平性方面始终优于最先进的基线方法，同时保持相当的通信和计算预算。

Conclusion: 协调个性化、域适应和标签效率是现实约束下实现鲁棒联邦学习的有效方法。

Abstract: Federated learning in practice must contend with heterogeneous feature
spaces, severe non-IID data, and scarce labels across clients. We present
FedFusion, a federated transfer-learning framework that unifies domain
adaptation and frugal labelling with diversity-/cluster-aware encoders (DivEn,
DivEn-mix, DivEn-c). Labelled teacher clients guide learner clients via
confidence-filtered pseudo-labels and domain-adaptive transfer, while clients
maintain personalised encoders tailored to local data. To preserve global
coherence under heterogeneity, FedFusion employs similarity-weighted classifier
coupling (with optional cluster-wise averaging), mitigating dominance by
data-rich sites and improving minority-client performance. The frugal-labelling
pipeline combines self-/semi-supervised pretext training with selective
fine-tuning, reducing annotation demands without sharing raw data. Across
tabular and imaging benchmarks under IID, non-IID, and label-scarce regimes,
FedFusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy,
robustness, and fairness while maintaining comparable communication and
computation budgets. These results show that harmonising personalisation,
domain adaptation, and label efficiency is an effective recipe for robust
federated learning under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have enabled the creation
of high-fidelity, temporally coherent clips from natural language prompts. Yet
these systems come with significant computational costs, and their energy
demands remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic study
of the latency and energy consumption of state-of-the-art open-source T2V
models. We first develop a compute-bound analytical model that predicts scaling
laws with respect to spatial resolution, temporal length, and denoising steps.
We then validate these predictions through fine-grained experiments on
WAN2.1-T2V, showing quadratic growth with spatial and temporal dimensions, and
linear scaling with the number of denoising steps. Finally, we extend our
analysis to six diverse T2V models, comparing their runtime and energy profiles
under default settings. Our results provide both a benchmark reference and
practical insights for designing and deploying more sustainable generative
video systems.

Abstract: In the context of the energy transition, with increasing integration of
renewable sources and cross-border electricity exchanges, power grids are
encountering greater uncertainty and operational risk. Maintaining grid
stability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators
are commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before
implementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are
often too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as
fast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g.,
Kirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are
also known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an
ablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from
incorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised
losses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to
advanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics
equations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called
LIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical
compliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The
results highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across
these criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the
corresponding Github page.

Method: 采用基于算法稳定性的分析方法，在扩散策略下对凸损失函数进行对抗训练的泛化分析。

Result: 理论推导表明泛化误差随对抗扰动强度和训练步数增加而增长，这一发现与单智能体情况一致，但在去中心化设置中是新颖的。逻辑回归数值实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 该研究为去中心化对抗训练的泛化性能提供了理论分析框架，揭示了对抗扰动和训练步数对泛化误差的影响规律。

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is an established tool for analyzing generalization.
While adversarial training enhances model robustness, it often suffers from
robust overfitting and an enlarged generalization gap. Although recent work has
established the convergence of adversarial training in decentralized networks,
its generalization properties remain unexplored. This work presents a
stability-based generalization analysis of adversarial training under the
diffusion strategy for convex losses. We derive a bound showing that the
generalization error grows with both the adversarial perturbation strength and
the number of training steps, a finding consistent with single-agent case but
novel for decentralized settings. Numerical experiments on logistic regression
validate these theoretical predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在大型推理模型中，更长的思维链（CoT）和更多的回顾步骤反而会降低准确性。作者提出了一种图结构视角来分析CoT，并引入了失败步骤比例（FSF）这一指标，该指标能更好地预测推理正确性。通过实验证明，减少失败分支可以显著提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在测试时需要大量计算资源来生成长思维链，但什么构成有效的思维链仍不清楚。虽然先前研究认为更长的思维链和更多的回顾步骤有益，但近期研究表明短思维链可能表现更好。作者旨在系统评估思维链长度和结构对推理准确性的影响。

Method: 1. 在十个大型推理模型上进行数学和科学推理的系统性评估；2. 引入图结构视角分析思维链，提出失败步骤比例（FSF）指标；3. 设计两种干预实验：基于指标排序候选思维链和编辑思维链移除失败分支。

Result: 研究发现：1. 思维链长度增加和回顾步骤增多与准确性降低相关；2. FSF指标在预测正确性方面优于长度和回顾比例；3. 移除失败分支能显著提高准确性，表明失败分支会干扰后续推理。

Conclusion: 有效的思维链特征是失败步骤较少，支持基于结构感知的测试时扩展策略，而非盲目生成长思维链。这一发现对优化推理模型的效率具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long
chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT
remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and
increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent
studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We
therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and
scientific reasoning. Contrary to the "longer-is-better" narrative, we find
that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with
*lower* accuracy.
  As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with
process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and
identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of
steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review
ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two
interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where
FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed
branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed
branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize
effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware*
test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.
