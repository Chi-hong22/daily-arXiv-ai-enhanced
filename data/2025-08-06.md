### [1] [PyCAT4: A Hierarchical Vision Transformer-based Framework for 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02806)
*Zongyou Yang,Jonathan Loo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的PyCAT4模型，通过结合Transformer特征提取和时空特征融合，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合CNN与Transformer架构的最新进展，优化现有的Pymaf网络架构，以提升3D人体姿态估计的精度。

Method: 1. 引入基于自注意力机制的Transformer特征提取层；2. 使用特征时序融合技术增强视频序列的时序信号捕捉；3. 采用空间金字塔结构实现多尺度特征融合。

Result: 在COCO和3DPW数据集上的实验表明，改进后的PyCAT4模型显著提升了姿态估计能力。

Conclusion: 提出的改进策略有效推动了人体姿态估计技术的发展。

Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these
advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf
network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1)
Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on
self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies
significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

### [3] [Live Demonstration: Neuromorphic Radar for Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03324)
*Satyapreet Singh Yadav,Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula,Chetan Singh Thakur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件驱动架构的神经形态雷达框架，用于实时、低功耗的手势识别（HGR）。系统通过异步Sigma-Delta编码将雷达信号转换为稀疏的脉冲表示，并由轻量级神经网络处理，显著降低了功耗和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统雷达HGR系统需要连续采样和处理数据，导致高功耗和计算开销。本文受生物传感启发，旨在开发一种低功耗、低延迟的实时手势识别系统。

Method: 系统由24 GHz多普勒雷达前端和神经形态采样器组成，将中频信号通过异步Sigma-Delta编码转换为脉冲表示，并由Cortex-M0微控制器上的轻量级神经网络处理。

Result: 在7名用户的5种手势数据集上，系统实现了>85%的实时准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个将生物启发的异步Sigma-Delta编码和事件驱动处理框架应用于雷达HGR的研究，显著降低了功耗和计算需求。

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

### [4] [DreamVVT: Mastering Realistic Video Virtual Try-On in the Wild via a Stage-Wise Diffusion Transformer Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02807)
*Tongchun Zuo,Zaiyu Huang,Shuliang Ning,Ente Lin,Chao Liang,Zerong Zheng,Jianwen Jiang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao,Xin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamVVT是一个基于扩散变换器的两阶段框架，通过利用未配对的人类中心数据提升视频虚拟试穿的真实性和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有端到端方法依赖稀缺配对数据集、难以保持细节和时间一致性的问题。

Method: 第一阶段使用多帧试穿模型和视觉语言模型生成高质量关键帧；第二阶段结合骨架图和外观描述，通过预训练视频生成模型增强时间一致性。

Result: DreamVVT在保留服装细节和时间稳定性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamVVT通过两阶段设计和利用预训练模型，显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的效果。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [5] [Learning Latent Representations for Image Translation using Frequency Distributed CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03415)
*Shivangi Nigam,Adarsh Prasad Behera,Shekhar Verma,P. Nagabhushan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fd-CycleGAN是一种改进的图像到图像翻译框架，通过增强潜在表示学习来逼近真实数据分布，结合局部邻域编码和频率感知监督，提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进CycleGAN在捕捉细粒度局部像素语义和保持结构一致性方面的不足，同时提升低数据情况下的性能。

Method: 集成局部邻域编码（LNE）和频率感知监督，使用KL/JS散度和基于对数的相似性度量来量化生成图像与真实图像在空间和频率域的对齐。

Result: 在Horse2Zebra、Monet2Photo等数据集上表现优于基线CycleGAN和其他先进方法，具有更好的感知质量、更快收敛和更高的模式多样性。

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN通过频率引导的潜在学习显著提升了图像翻译任务的泛化能力，适用于文档修复、艺术风格迁移和医学图像合成等领域。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

### [6] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出在IJEPA架构中，用DynTanh激活替换层归一化（LN），以保留视觉标记的自然能量层次，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层归一化（LN）破坏了视觉标记的自然能量层次，导致模型无法优先处理语义丰富的区域，并产生棋盘状伪影。

Method: 用DynTanh激活替换LN，以更好地保留标记能量，并允许高能量标记对预测损失贡献更大。

Result: 改进后的IJEPA模型在ImageNet线性探测准确率从38%提升至42.7%，并在NYU Depth V2单目深度估计中降低RMSE 0.08。

Conclusion: 保留自然标记能量对自监督视觉表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [7] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE结合了NeRF的高保真渲染和GS的可编辑性，通过高斯特征嵌入和高效搜索实现实时编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NeRF难以编辑和GS渲染质量不足的问题，结合两者优势。

Method: 使用高斯特征嵌入和RT-GPS搜索，结合多分辨率哈希网格。

Result: 实现实时、局部感知的编辑，支持动态交互和物理模拟。

Conclusion: GENIE填补了几何编辑与神经渲染之间的空白。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code

### [8] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于粗标注的医学图像分割框架，通过联合训练和矩阵建模逐步逼近精确标注，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的像素级标注成本高且需要专业知识，粗标注虽易获取但存在噪声。

Method: 引入转移矩阵建模粗标注中的不准确区域，通过联合训练逐步优化分割结果。

Result: 在两个心脏影像数据集上表现优异，超越弱监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用粗标注，为医学图像分割提供了一种低成本高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [9] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAR是一个LiDAR检测模拟模型，用于在微观交通模拟器中生成近似真实的LiDAR检测结果，填补了高保真模拟器与可扩展性模拟器之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模真实自动驾驶车辆部署不现实，而现有模拟器要么缺乏感知建模能力（如SUMO），要么在多车场景下扩展性不足（如CARLA），因此需要一种方法在可扩展的模拟器中生成真实的LiDAR检测结果。

Method: MIDAR通过车辆级特征预测真实LiDAR检测结果中的真阳性和假阴性，构建RM-LoS图编码遮挡关系，并使用GRU增强的APPNP架构进行特征传播。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MIDAR的AUC达到0.909，接近主流3D LiDAR检测模型CenterPoint的结果。

Conclusion: MIDAR成功填补了模拟器的感知建模空白，适用于需要精确车辆观测的交通应用，并将开源以促进研究。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于Transformer的神经网络在高分辨率卫星图像中的物体检测性能，并与卷积网络进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉Transformer的出现，需要了解其在卫星图像上的表现，尤其是与卷积网络的对比。

Method: 比较了11种检测算法（包括5种Transformer架构和6种卷积网络），在三个公开数据集上训练和评估了33个模型。

Result: Transformer架构在多个基准数据集上表现出色，展示了其在卫星图像中的潜力。

Conclusion: Transformer在卫星图像物体检测中具有竞争力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

TL;DR: VisuCraft是一个新框架，通过结合多模态结构化信息提取器和动态提示生成模块，显著提升大型视觉语言模型在复杂视觉引导创意内容生成中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时难以保持高视觉保真度、真实创意和精确遵循用户指令。

Method: VisuCraft整合了多模态结构化信息提取器（E）和动态提示生成模块（G），提取图像的细粒度视觉属性并生成优化提示。

Result: 在ImageStoryGen-500K数据集上评估，VisuCraft在故事生成和诗歌创作等任务中表现优于基线模型，尤其在创意和指令遵循方面。

Conclusion: VisuCraft为大型视觉语言模型在复杂创意AI应用中开辟了新潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖正常数据训练，限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决仅含污染数据时的异常分割问题。

Method: 将最大似然估计转化为非线性回归问题，通过鲁棒回归推导出鲁棒版本的扩散模型。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上，AUROC提高8.08%，AUPRC提高10.37%。

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒扩散模型在污染数据场景下表现优异，为异常分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过用户定义的材料配置（如地毯和声学墙砖）改变录音室的声音特性，实现材料控制的声学轮廓生成。

Result: 模型能够动态生成多样化的RIR，并在新数据集上表现优于基线方法和现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效编码材料信息并生成高保真RIR，为声学轮廓生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了现成的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在视觉与语言导航（VLN）任务中的表现，发现其虽能完成任务，但效果不及专门设计的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现成LVLM在VLN任务中的潜力，以及其是否支持低级和全景动作范式。

Method: 微调开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct，并在Room-to-Room数据集上评估其性能。

Result: 最佳模型在R2R测试集上的成功率为41%，表明现成LVLM虽能学习VLN，但效果不及专用模型。

Conclusion: 现成LVLM在VLN任务中表现尚可，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

Result: MAP估计倾向于产生模糊解，而局部极小值对应清晰图像，需良好初始化以找到这些解。

Conclusion: 克服MAP限制需关注后验分布的局部极小值，改进先验和优化技术可提升盲去卷积效果。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

TL;DR: 研究了ImageNet预训练对超小型模型（参数<1M）在红外视觉模态下游目标检测任务中鲁棒性的影响，发现预训练仍有益但存在容量阈值，超过后收益递减。


<details>

Motivation: 探索预训练对小型模型在嵌入式设备上鲁棒性的影响，特别是在红外视觉模态下的目标检测任务。

Method: 通过标准目标识别架构的缩放定律构建两个超小型主干家族，系统研究其性能。

Result: 实验表明，ImageNet预训练仍有用，但超过一定容量阈值后，对分布外检测鲁棒性的提升效果递减。

Conclusion: 建议实践者仍使用预训练，并避免过小模型，因其在域内表现良好但在不同工作条件下脆弱。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

TL;DR: X-Actor是一个音频驱动的肖像动画框架，通过单张参考图像和音频生成逼真、情感丰富的说话头部视频。其核心是两阶段解耦生成流程，结合自回归扩散模型和视频合成模块，实现长时情感连贯的动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注唇部同步和短时视觉保真度，而X-Actor旨在生成具有动态情感演变的演员级长时肖像表演。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）音频条件自回归扩散模型预测面部运动潜在标记；2）扩散视频合成模块生成高保真动画。通过解耦的面部运动潜在空间和扩散强制训练，捕捉长时音频与面部动态关联。

Result: 实验表明，X-Actor能生成超越标准说话头部动画的电影级表演，在长时音频驱动情感肖像表演中达到最优效果。

Conclusion: X-Actor通过解耦生成流程和扩散模型，实现了长时情感连贯的高质量肖像动画，为音频驱动表演开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于尺度等变性的盲去噪框架，通过HNM和IGM模块提升模型对空间非均匀噪声的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪模型在空间变化噪声（OOD条件）下泛化能力不足，尺度等变性被提出作为核心归纳偏置以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出包含HNM（稳定特征分布）和IGM（信息调制）的盲去噪框架，利用尺度等变性提升泛化能力。

Result: 模型在合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法，尤其在空间异质噪声条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: 尺度等变性是提升去噪模型OOD鲁棒性的有效途径，提出的框架具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成多样且高质量的图像时，对提示的遵从性和质量存在显著差异。负提示虽能改善提示遵从性，但需要外部资源且不完整。

Method: 提出ANSWER方法，结合负提示和无分类器引导（CFG），利用扩散模型内部对否定的理解，实现无需显式负提示的负条件采样。

Result: ANSWER在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，人类评估显示其受欢迎程度是其他方法的2倍。

Conclusion: ANSWER是一种高效、无需训练的技术，适用于任何支持CFG的模型，显著提升了图像生成与提示的匹配度。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:

domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性扰动方法在攻击变换器检测器时效果有限，AFOG旨在填补这一空白，提供一种通用的攻击框架。

Method: AFOG利用可学习的注意力机制聚焦于脆弱区域，结合特征损失和迭代扰动注入，实现高效攻击。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，AFOG比现有方法性能提升高达83%，且速度快、隐蔽性强。

Conclusion: AFOG是一种通用的对抗性攻击方法，适用于变换器和CNN检测器，具有高效性和隐蔽性。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在扩散模型生成过程中检测NSFW内容的新方法（IGD），利用预测噪声作为内部信号，实验显示其检测准确率达91.32%，优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像的同时，可能被滥用于生成NSFW内容，而现有方法主要集中在生成前或生成后的检测，生成过程中的检测尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出In-Generation Detection (IGD)方法，利用扩散过程中的预测噪声作为内部信号来识别NSFW内容。

Result: 在七种NSFW类别上的实验表明，IGD的平均检测准确率为91.32%，优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD是一种简单有效的NSFW内容检测方法，尤其在对抗性提示下表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MGFC的新框架，通过多粒度特征校准提升域泛化语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征微调，忽略了特征层次的多粒度适应，而这对密集预测任务至关重要。

Method: MGFC框架分三步校准特征：粗粒度捕获全局语义，中粒度增强类别区分性，细粒度优化空间细节。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MGFC优于现有域泛化语义分割方法。

Conclusion: 多粒度特征校准能有效提升域泛化语义分割的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中表现不佳，主要因资源限制无法处理所有帧信息，且现有框架不满足实际需求。

Method: 提出SLFG方法，通过将单帧组合为语义连贯的场景帧，结合场景定位和动态帧重组机制，无需修改原模型架构。

Result: 实验表明SLFG在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SLFG显著提升了MLLMs的长视频理解能力，具有即插即用的实用性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了高达66倍的压缩，同时保持或提升渲染质量。

Conclusion: SA-3DGS不仅高效压缩模型，还提升了其他修剪方法的性能，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

*Lekang Wen,Jing Xiao,Liang Liao,Jiajun Chen,Mi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHARM框架通过互补学习实现模态间的协调而非同质化，显著提升多模态语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过特征对齐实现模态同质化，但削弱了各模态的独特优势和互补性。

Method: 提出CHARM框架，包含Mutual Perception Unit（MPU）实现隐式对齐，以及双路径优化策略（CoL和InE）。

Result: 在多个数据集和骨干网络上，CHARM显著优于基线，尤其在脆弱模态上表现突出。

Conclusion: CHARM将焦点从同质化转向协调化，实现了多样性的真正和谐。

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

Motivation: 解决不同摄像头源图像特征差异导致的UDA行人重识别问题，提高模型在跨域场景中的适应性。

Method: 使用CycleGAN生成多样化数据，结合师生网络和多级聚类生成伪标签，引入可学习的集成融合组件优化全局和局部特征。

Conclusion: CORE-ReID框架通过集成融合和多级优化，有效解决了UDA行人重识别中的特征模糊问题，成为该领域的先进解决方案。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSFMamba是一种基于Mamba的对称驱动空间-频率特征融合网络，用于3D医学图像分割，通过双分支架构和Mamba块融合空间与频率域特征，提升全局上下文建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D医学图像分割中未能充分利用频率域信息的独特性质（如共轭对称性）及其与空间域的数据分布差异，导致频率域的优势未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出SSFMamba，采用双分支架构分别提取空间和频率域特征，利用Mamba块融合异构特征，并设计3D多方向扫描机制增强局部与全局线索融合。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上的实验表明，SSFMamba在多种评估指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSFMamba通过有效融合空间与频率域特征，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的性能，验证了频率域信息在全局建模中的重要性。

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RobustGS的多视图特征增强模块，用于提升3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）方法在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈式3DGS方法假设输入的多视图图像是干净且高质量的，但在实际场景中，图像常受噪声、低光或雨等恶劣条件影响，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 引入通用退化学习器和语义感知状态空间模型，增强退化感知能力并提升特征空间中的输入质量，同时通过语义感知策略聚合跨视图信息。

Result: 实验表明，RobustGS模块能以即插即用方式提升现有方法的重建质量，在各种退化条件下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: RobustGS显著提升了前馈式3DGS方法在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性和重建质量。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注人口统计属性（如种族、性别），但更广泛属性的公平性尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建开放知识库，评估LVLMs在细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: 实验表明LVLMs在多种属性上存在偏见，且文化、环境等非传统因素对其决策影响更大。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs在更广泛属性上的公平性问题，强调了非传统因素的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Motivation: 现有伪袋增强方法采样实例的多样性受限，影响模型性能，尤其是对小肿瘤区域的测试图像。

Method: 采用对比跨袋增强（$C^2Aug$）从所有同类袋中采样实例，并结合袋级和组级对比学习框架。

Result: 实验表明$C^2Aug$在多个评估指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$通过增加伪袋多样性和对比学习，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分类系统需要适应动态变化的临床环境，现有方法仅依赖简单的文本模板，忽略了丰富的语义信息。

Method: 动态构建视觉概念池并使用相似性过滤机制，通过跨模态图像-概念注意力模块和注意力损失整合语义信息。

Result: 在医学和自然图像数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效利用了语义信息，显著提升了持续学习的性能，代码将公开。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GRPO在长时视频多模态推理中的三个关键限制：数据效率低、优势消失问题和均匀信用分配。

Method: 提出AVATAR框架，包含离策略训练架构和时序优势塑造（TAS）策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，超越基线模型，样本效率提升35%以上。

Conclusion: AVATAR有效解决了GRPO的局限性，在多模态视频推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA)，通过无监督独立成分分析(ICA)显式解耦CLIP提取的视觉特征，减少可训练参数并避免过拟合，同时增强跨模态对齐，显著提升小样本学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小样本学习方法依赖隐式解耦表示，难以有效适应有限标注数据，而多模态对比学习（如CLIP）理论上能解耦潜在表示。

Method: CCA利用ICA显式解耦CLIP视觉特征，并通过单向（微调文本分类器）和双向（跨注意力机制）增强跨模态对齐。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，CCA在小样本性能和分布偏移鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: CCA通过显式解耦和增强跨模态对齐，显著提升了小样本学习的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有方法在几何精度和鲁棒性之间存在权衡，H3R旨在通过结合显式和隐式方法的优势来解决这一问题。

Method: H3R由两部分组成：通过极线约束增强几何一致性的潜在体积模块，以及利用Plücker坐标进行自适应对应优化的相机感知Transformer。

Result: H3R在多个基准测试中表现优异，PSNR显著提升（RealEstate10K: 0.59 dB, ACID: 1.06 dB, DTU: 0.22 dB），且收敛速度快2倍。

Conclusion: H3R通过结合两种范式，实现了高效且泛化能力强的3D重建，同时解决了语义与空间重建需求的不匹配问题。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and

Result: COFFEE在合成数据和小行星Apophis的渲染数据上表现优于传统方法，速度比现有深度学习方法快一个数量级。

Conclusion: COFFEE是一种高效、无偏的姿态估计框架，适用于空间任务中的实时状态估计。

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Conclusion: Landsat30-AU数据集为卫星图像理解提供了新基准，微调方法展示了提升模型性能的潜力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

Conclusion: LRDDv2为长距离无人机检测研究提供了重要数据支持。

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones
with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution. For access to the complete

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: OmniShape是一种新方法，通过解耦形状补全为两个多模态分布，实现从单次观测中估计物体姿态和完整形状的概率模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是从单次观测中估计物体的姿态和完整形状，而不依赖于已知的3D模型或类别信息。

Method: OmniShape将形状补全解耦为两个多模态分布：一个捕捉测量数据在归一化对象参考系中的投影，另一个建模对象几何的先验（表示为三平面神经场）。通过训练两个条件扩散模型，支持从联合姿态和形状分布中采样多个假设。

Result: OmniShape在真实世界数据集上表现出色。

Conclusion: OmniShape是首个实现概率姿态和形状估计的方法，具有创新性和实用性。

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single
observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we
propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose
and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape
completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UniEdit-I的无训练框架，通过理解、编辑和验证三个迭代步骤，为统一视觉语言模型（VLM）添加图像编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管OpenAI的GPT-4o提出的生成管道在统一VLM中表现出潜力，但如何轻松实现图像编辑能力仍未探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过三个步骤实现图像编辑：1) 理解步骤分析源图像并生成目标提示；2) 编辑步骤引入时间自适应偏移实现连贯编辑；3) 验证步骤检查对齐并提供反馈。

Result: 基于BLIP3-o实现的方法在GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniEdit-I框架为统一VLM提供了一种无需训练的高保真图像编辑解决方案，具有显著的应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

TL;DR: Veila是一种新型条件扩散框架，通过结合置信感知条件机制、几何跨模态对齐和全景特征一致性，解决了RGB图像与全景LiDAR数据生成中的挑战，实现了高保真生成和跨模态一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成全景LiDAR数据时缺乏可控性或细粒度空间控制，而基于RGB图像的生成方法面临语义深度变化、模态差异和结构一致性等挑战。

Method: Veila框架包括置信感知条件机制（CACM）、几何跨模态对齐（GCMA）和全景特征一致性（PFC），并引入跨模态语义一致性和深度一致性指标。

Result: 在nuScenes、SemanticKITTI和KITTI-Weather基准测试中，Veila实现了最先进的生成保真度和跨模态一致性，并提升了LiDAR语义分割性能。

Conclusion: Veila通过创新方法解决了RGB与LiDAR数据生成中的核心问题，为自动驾驶和机器人领域的3D感知提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法在空间可控性和区域保真度上表现不足，需要一种更精确的异常合成方法。

Method: 提出SARD框架，结合区域约束扩散（RCD）和判别性掩码指导（DMG），选择性更新异常区域并评估全局和局部保真度。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和BTAD数据集上，SARD在分割精度和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARD为像素级异常合成设定了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在LiDAR生成中缺乏对前景物体和空间关系的显式控制，限制了其在场景模拟和安全验证中的应用。

Method: 采用布局引导的生成框架，结合语义增强的场景图扩散和关系感知的上下文条件，生成结构化LiDAR布局，并通过前景感知控制注入完成场景生成。

Result: 实验表明，La La LiDAR在LiDAR生成和下游感知任务中达到最先进性能，并提出了新的评估指标。

Conclusion: La La LiDAR为可控3D场景生成设定了新基准，解决了现有模型在控制性方面的不足。

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

TL;DR: LORE是一种无需训练的高效图像编辑方法，通过优化倒置噪声解决现有方法在泛化和可控性上的核心限制，实现稳定、可控的通用概念替换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于倒置流的图像编辑方法在语义相似性不足时存在结构性缺陷，导致编辑失败或非目标区域意外修改。

Method: LORE直接优化倒置噪声，无需架构修改或模型微调，提升泛化和可控性。

Result: 在PIEBench、SmartEdit和GapEdit三个基准测试中，LORE在语义对齐、图像质量和背景保真度上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LORE通过潜在空间优化实现了高效、通用的图像编辑，展示了其有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter为数据增强和仿真提供了新途径，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation
and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表数据集存在无关信息和结构元素不足的问题，导致视觉语言模型生成图表描述时准确性和信息量不足。

Method: 设计四阶段流程生成仅基于图表可识别数据的描述，并采用循环一致性人工验证加速质量控制。

Result: 实验表明，基于ChartCap微调的模型生成的描述更准确、信息量更大，且幻觉减少，优于开源、专有模型及人工标注。

Conclusion: ChartCap数据集和视觉一致性评分标准为生成高质量图表描述提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在理解复杂视觉文本上下文方面取得突破，但幻觉问题限制了其实际应用，尤其是在风格化图像中。

Method: 构建了一个包含摄影图像及其风格化版本的数据集，并提出了SAVER机制，通过动态调整模型输出来减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，风格化图像比摄影图像更容易引发幻觉，而SAVER在多种任务和数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: SAVER能有效减少风格化图像引发的幻觉，提升LVLMs的实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Conclusion: Duplex-GS框架显著提升了高斯渲染的效率和质量，验证了OIT渲染范式的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

Conclusion: 提出的模块有效提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少遗忘的同时表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: KAN-CFD框架有效解决了持续人脸伪造检测中的灾难性遗忘问题，并提升了检测性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湿性年龄相关性黄斑变性（wet AMD）是全球致盲的主要原因之一，其关键特征是脉络膜新生血管（CNV）。OCTA图像因其高分辨率和无创性被广泛用于CNV研究，但现有方法在分割不规则CNV区域和血管时面临挑战，且缺乏公开数据集。

Method: MTG-Net通过多任务框架和两个图模块（MIGR和MRGR）整合区域和血管形态信息，利用图机制优化跨任务关系，并提出不确定性加权损失以减少噪声影响。

Result: 实验表明，MTG-Net在区域分割和血管分割上的Dice分数分别达到87.21%和88.12%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTG-Net通过多边图卷积交互和不确定性加权损失，显著提升了CNV分割的准确性，为wet AMD的临床评估提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg三个基准测试中表现优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: AlignCAT通过充分利用语言线索，有效过滤未对齐的视觉查询并提升对比学习效率，验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

*Ting Lei,Shaofeng Yin,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INP-CC是一种端到端的开放词汇HOI检测器，通过交互感知提示和概念校准提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因图像级预训练与细粒度区域级交互检测不匹配，以及文本描述编码不足，限制了HOI检测能力。

Method: 提出交互感知提示生成器和语言模型引导的概念校准，结合负采样策略优化跨模态相似性建模。

Result: 在SWIG-HOI和HICO-DET数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: INP-CC通过动态提示和概念校准有效提升了开放词汇HOI检测性能。

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

### [60] [GeoShield: Safeguarding Geolocation Privacy from Vision-Language Models via Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03209)
*Xinwei Liu,Xiaojun Jia,Yuan Xun,Simeng Qin,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoShield是一种新型对抗框架，旨在保护现实场景中的地理隐私，通过特征解耦、暴露元素识别和尺度自适应增强模块，有效防御高级视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）的地理位置推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）能够从公开共享的图像中推断用户位置，地理隐私面临重大风险。现有的对抗扰动方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算下表现不佳，且可能引入无关语义内容。

Method: GeoShield包含三个模块：特征解耦模块分离地理和非地理信息，暴露元素识别模块定位图像中的地理揭示区域，尺度自适应增强模块联合优化全局和局部扰动以确保跨分辨率有效性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GeoShield在黑盒设置下显著优于现有方法，实现了强隐私保护且对视觉或语义质量影响最小。

Conclusion: GeoShield是首个探索对抗扰动防御高级视觉语言模型地理推断的研究，为解决日益严重的隐私问题提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗扰动对深度学习模型构成重大威胁，而现有的对抗训练方法计算成本高且可能降低标准性能。数据增强技术虽有潜力，但现有方法要么鲁棒性提升有限，要么训练开销大。因此，开发一种高效且鲁棒的防御机制至关重要。

Method: 论文首先系统分析了现有增强技术，发现多种策略的协同作用对提升鲁棒性至关重要。基于此，提出了UAA框架，其特点是即插即用和训练高效。UAA通过离线预计算通用变换，解耦了昂贵的扰动生成过程与模型训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验验证了UAA的有效性，结果表明UAA在基于数据增强的对抗防御策略中达到了新的SOTA，且无需在训练时在线生成对抗样本。

Conclusion: UAA为构建鲁棒模型提供了一种实用且高效的途径，其代码已在补充材料中公开。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ActionSink的新型机器人操作框架，通过自监督方式将机器人动作重新定义为视频中的光流（称为“动作流”），并通过迭代检索和去噪以及动态整合历史动作流来提升动作估计的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的机器人操作中，低级别动作估计的低精度成为性能的主要限制因素，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ActionSink包含两个主要模块：1）粗到细的动作流匹配器，通过迭代检索和去噪提高动作流精度；2）动态动作流整合器，通过工作记忆池动态管理历史动作流，并使用多层融合模块整合当前和历史的动作流。

Result: ActionSink在LIBERO基准测试中比之前的最佳方法提升了7.9%的成功率，在LIBERO-Long任务中提升了近8%的准确率。

Conclusion: ActionSink通过自监督的动作流定义和动态整合机制，显著提升了机器人操作中的动作估计精度。

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

Conclusion: GIT方法有效解决了分割边界噪声问题，支持层次分割、对象提取和场景编辑等应用。

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and
industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification
pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化妆数据集收集困难，合成方法在真实性和一致性上存在问题，需要高质量配对数据集支持美容相关任务。

Method: 基于FFHQ数据集，改进化妆迁移方法，分离身份与化妆风格，生成18K身份的90K高质量配对图像。

Result: 构建了首个专注于化妆的高质量数据集FFHQ-Makeup，每个身份配对5种化妆风格。

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup填补了高质量化妆数据集的空白，为美容相关任务提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

TL;DR: MVTOP是一种基于Transformer的多视角刚性物体姿态估计方法，通过早期融合视角特征解决单视角无法解决的姿态模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角或后处理单视角姿态无法解决的多视角姿态模糊问题。

Method: 利用视线建模多视角几何，假设相机内部和相对方向已知，但可以变化。

Result: 在合成数据集和YCB-V数据集上优于单视角和现有多视角方法。

Conclusion: MVTOP是一种端到端可训练的全新多视角方法，无需额外数据即可可靠解决姿态模糊问题。

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

Conclusion: RSDNet通过单步推理和DLF设计，显著提升了3D目标检测的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

Conclusion: ReDPO和V.I.P.框架能高效生成高质量视频，显著减少模型参数。

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注孤立单词，而真实手写文本需要关注单词间关系（如垂直对齐和水平间距），因此生成整行文本更具挑战性和实用性。

Method: DiffBrush采用内容解耦风格学习（通过列和行掩码分离风格与内容）和多尺度内容学习（使用行和单词判别器确保全局一致性和局部准确性）。

Result: 实验表明，DiffBrush在生成高质量文本行方面表现出色，尤其在风格再现和内容保留方面。

Conclusion: DiffBrush为手写文本行生成提供了一种有效方法，解决了风格和内容建模的复杂问题。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

Conclusion: EgoPrompt通过组件交互和多样化池标准，显著提升了第一人称动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and

Conclusion: EmmPD框架在胎盘疾病诊断中表现出色，平衡了计算效率和特征保留。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: SDGPA通过合成数据和渐进适应策略有效解决了零样本域自适应语义分割问题。

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法因传感器数据稀疏和缺乏不平坦地形数据集，在姿态估计精度和地形适应性上受限。

Method: 利用智能手机和智能手表的气压计数据估计高度变化，提出局部大腿坐标系分离局部和全局运动输入。

Result: 在公开基准和真实场景中，BaroPoser优于仅使用IMU的现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合气压计数据显著提升不平坦地形下的人体运动追踪性能。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Motivation: 现有自回归扩散模型在长视频生成中存在时间漂移和并行化困难，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出MMPL框架，通过微观规划和宏观规划两阶段生成全局故事线，并基于内容填充并行生成中间帧。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在质量和稳定性上优于现有长视频生成模型。

Conclusion: MMPL框架有效解决了长视频生成中的时间漂移和并行化问题，提升了生成效果。

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段方法，用于恢复极暗图像中的细节，结合频域全局光照恢复和纹理结构细化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恢复暗图像细节时效果有限，导致下游应用（如文本和边缘检测）性能不佳。

Method: 第一阶段使用残差傅里叶引导模块（RFGM）恢复频域全局光照；第二阶段通过Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba细化纹理结构。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和下游应用中显著提升了细节恢复性能，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量且可无缝集成到现有傅里叶框架中，为暗图像细节恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应帧剪枝（AFP）方法，通过减少视频帧数和输入标记数量，显著提升了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频问答（Video-QA）中的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频问答中处理大量视频帧的高标记成本限制了多模态大语言模型的实际应用，且过多的帧可能导致性能下降。

Method: 采用自适应层次聚类算法在融合的ResNet-50和CLIP特征空间上剪枝关键帧，并结合轻量级文本语义图补充信息。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME基准测试中，帧数减少86.9%，输入标记减少83.2%，且准确性有所提升。

Conclusion: AFP方法不仅提高了效率，还通过提供高质量帧集提升了性能，为视频问答的实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像可见性差，现有方法缺乏可解释性或依赖不可靠先验，物理方法假设简化。

Result: 框架有效提升低光图像质量，增强细节和亮度。

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE通过因果干预和离散表示学习，显著改进低光图像增强效果。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在匹配3D动作与文本时忽视了人体结构的复杂性和时空动态性，导致语义对齐不精确。

Method: WaMo包含三个关键组件：轨迹小波分解、轨迹小波重构和乱序动作序列预测，以提取多分辨率运动特征并增强时空信息保留。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，WaMo的Rsum分别提升了17.0%和18.2%，优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: WaMo通过多频率特征提取和时空信息保留，显著提升了文本-动作检索的精确性。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Motivation: 现有基于Hessian的LLM后训练量化方法在VLM中因模态差异（文本令牌有限而视觉令牌冗余）导致性能显著下降，需要针对VLM的量化方法。

Method: VLMQ通过优化重要性感知目标，生成增强的Hessian矩阵，并结合轻量级块级反向传播计算令牌级重要性因子，同时保持并行化权重更新的兼容性。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，VLMQ在0.5B∼32B规模的VLM上表现出色，尤其在低比特设置下，如2位量化时在MME-RealWorld上提升了16.45%。

Conclusion: VLMQ为VLM的后训练量化提供了高效且有效的解决方案，显著提升了低比特量化下的性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

Result: 在五个图像分类基准上表现优于现有方法，适用于资源有限客户端。

Conclusion: FedPromo在性能、隐私和资源效率之间取得平衡，适用于多领域学习。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Result: 实验表明DOD在视觉质量和推理效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD是一种高效且适应性强的图像修复方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在病理分割中忽视解剖背景，而解剖理解对放射科医生至关重要。GRASP旨在填补这一差距。

Method: GRASP通过伪标签输入通道和基于transformer的特征融合，将解剖知识注入病理分割模型。

Result: 在多个PET/CT数据集上，GRASP在多种评估指标和架构中表现优异。

Conclusion: GRASP通过双重解剖注入策略，有效整合解剖背景，提升病理分割性能。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

Result: 实验表明GaitAdapter能有效保留多任务知识，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter为持续步态识别提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了模型的适应性和区分能力。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NAVIA的方法，通过信息增强中和令牌聚合，解决了高效测试时适应（ETTA）问题，显著提升了性能并降低了推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应（TTA）方法在视觉变换器（ViT）中计算开销大，且令牌聚合方法直接集成会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出NAVIA方法，通过增强[CLS]令牌嵌入和在浅层引入自适应偏置，利用熵最小化恢复信息损失。

Result: NAVIA在多个分布偏移基准测试中性能优于现有方法2.5%以上，推理延迟降低20%以上。

Conclusion: NAVIA有效解决了ETTA问题，平衡了适应能力和计算效率。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

Motivation: 现有2D剪影和骨架表示不足以应对视角变化和捕捉步态细节，需更丰富的输入模态。

Method: 从RGB序列估计深度图作为新模态，并开发多尺度跨级融合方案。

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到最先进性能，挑战性数据集上获得高排名准确率。

Conclusion: DepthGait通过结合深度图和剪影，显著提升了步态识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

TL;DR: SCFlow提出了一种通过可逆合并风格与内容的方法，避免显式解耦，利用流匹配框架实现双向映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉模型中显式解耦风格与内容时面临语义重叠和主观感知的挑战。

Method: SCFlow采用流匹配框架，通过训练合并风格与内容的任务，实现可逆解耦，无需显式监督。

Result: SCFlow在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt上展示了零样本泛化能力，性能具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 解耦可以通过可逆合并过程自然实现，无需显式监督。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Motivation: 高光谱解混是预处理的关键步骤，现有方法在空间相似性和稀疏性表征方面存在不足。

Method: 基于多层矩阵分解模型，引入总变差约束考虑空间相似性，采用L1/2范数稀疏约束表征丰度矩阵的稀疏性，并使用ADMM优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，STVMLU相比其他算法性能更优。

Conclusion: STVMLU通过结合空间相似性和稀疏性约束，显著提升了高光谱解混的准确性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在参数规模、自我纠正能力和复杂推理任务上表现不足，尤其在长视觉上下文和文档任务中。

Method: MACT包含四个小规模智能体（规划、执行、判断和回答），通过混合奖励建模和智能体级混合测试时扩展优化协作。

Result: MACT在15个基准测试中的13个领先，且参数规模更小，同时在通用和数学任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: MACT通过多智能体协作和定制化扩展策略，显著提升了视觉语言任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

Method: 使用SlotMatch框架，通过余弦相似度对齐师生模型的槽表示，无需额外损失或辅助监督。

Result: 学生模型在参数减少3.6倍、速度提升1.9倍的情况下，性能与教师模型相当甚至更优，并超越其他无监督视频分割模型。

Conclusion: SlotMatch是一种简单有效的知识蒸馏方法，显著提升了无监督视频分割的效率与性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source

Conclusion: IMAC通过创新的时空对齐和分离建模，有效解决了EEG跨域分类问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

Motivation: 冷启动主动学习（CSAL）在医学图像分析中缺乏先验知识时选择信息样本，现有方法依赖自监督学习（SSL），效率低且特征表示不足，而预训练基础模型（FMs）的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出MedCAL-Bench基准测试，评估14种FMs和7种CSAL策略在7个数据集上的表现，覆盖分类和分割任务，并首次同时评估特征提取和样本选择阶段。

Result: 1）大多数FMs在CSAL中是有效的特征提取器，DINO家族在分割任务中表现最佳；2）FMs在分割任务中表现差异大，分类任务中差异小；3）不同数据集需采用不同样本选择策略。

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench为医学图像分析中的CSAL提供了系统评估，展示了FMs的潜力，并强调了任务和数据集对策略选择的重要性。

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

Conclusion: 自适应引导调度是释放快速流式生成模型潜力的关键，具有广泛的适用性和稳定性。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Conclusion: 双摄像头框架有效解决了摩尔纹与真实纹理的区分问题，并保持了色调和时间一致性。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

Conclusion: AVPDN在视频息肉检测任务中具有竞争力，解决了动态视频中的噪声和尺度问题。

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLM在长序列生成中表现出注意力下降和幻觉增加的问题，但原因尚不明确。研究旨在揭示视觉注意力与幻觉的关系，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过分析视觉注意力与序列长度的关系，提出IKOD策略，合并短序列的高注意力logits以抑制注意力退化。

Conclusion: IKOD是一种轻量高效的解码策略，适用于多种LVLM，无需额外资源即可改善性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

*Junjie Cao,Kaizhou Li,Xinchun Yu,Hongxiang Li,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGuard是一种保护视频免受未经授权恶意编辑的方法，通过引入几乎不可察觉的扰动干扰生成扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成技术的快速发展可能导致恶意滥用，现有研究对视频内容的保护不足。

Method: 采用联合帧优化和视频运动信息融合，优化扰动以干扰生成模型。

Result: VideoGuard的保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard有效填补了视频内容保护的技术空白。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖提示级建模，由于输入令牌容量有限，导致个性化不准确。

Method: 提出DrUM，结合用户画像和基于变压器的适配器，实现潜在空间中的条件级建模。

Result: DrUM在大规模数据集上表现优异，无需额外微调即可与开源文本编码器兼容。

Conclusion: DrUM有效解决了T2I扩散模型中的个性化生成问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 论文提出SODA框架，用于检测生成模型中对象（如汽车）的隐性人口统计偏见，发现模型输出中存在与人口统计相关的视觉属性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成模型中对象的人口统计偏见，揭示隐性偏见及其对多样性的影响。

Method: 引入SODA框架，通过比较中性提示与人口统计提示生成的2700张图像，分析视觉属性差异。

Result: 发现模型输出中存在与性别、种族等人口统计相关的视觉偏见，部分模型输出多样性较低。

Conclusion: SODA框架为检测和减少生成模型中的偏见提供了实用方法，是迈向更负责任AI开发的重要一步。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

TL;DR: LRQ-DiT提出了一种高效的后训练量化框架，通过Twin-Log量化和自适应旋转方案解决DiT模型在低比特量化中的权重分布和激活异常问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但高计算成本和参数量限制了其在资源受限场景的应用。现有后训练量化方法在极低比特设置下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出LRQ-DiT框架，包括Twin-Log量化（TLQ）和自适应旋转方案（ARS），分别优化权重分布和激活异常问题。

Result: 在PixArt、FLUX等模型上验证，LRQ-DiT在低比特量化下保持图像质量，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT有效解决了DiT模型低比特量化的关键问题，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑行业资源消耗大，回收材料质量监测仍依赖人工，需更高效的视觉机器学习方法。

Method: 改进分割基础模型（ParticleSAM），创建模拟密集多颗粒数据集，用于自动化质量监控。

Result: 实验验证ParticleSAM优于原SAM方法，适用于小颗粒分割。

Conclusion: ParticleSAM在建筑颗粒分割中表现优异，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Motivation: 组织样本常大于标准显微镜载玻片，需拼接多片段以分析完整结构（如肿瘤），但现有方法因组织损失、变形等问题受限。

Method: 基于视觉病理学基础模型的潜在特征表示，通过大量语义匹配候选进行鲁棒姿态估计，拼接多片段形成完整载玻片。

Result: 在三个病理学数据集上，SemanticStitcher表现出鲁棒的拼接效果，边界匹配准确性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher通过语义匹配解决了组织拼接的挑战，为病理学分析提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Motivation: 探讨在SDL中稀疏性对恢复质量的影响，以及不同优化方法如何影响稀疏性。

Method: 使用多种优化方法（如迭代收缩算法）分析稀疏字典学习的稀疏性。

Result: 不同方法产生不同稀疏性，高稀疏性不损害恢复质量，即使恢复图像与学习数据库差异较大。

Conclusion: 高稀疏性在SDL中可行且不影响恢复质量，为图像处理提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PECM的框架，通过多级原型和双流置信度估计，提升医学图像与报告跨模态检索的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像与报告检索中存在语义模糊和变异性，现有模型难以捕捉多级语义关系，导致检索结果不可靠。

Method: PECM框架引入多级原型和双流置信度估计，利用原型相似性分布和自适应加权机制减少高不确定性数据对检索排名的影响。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中，PECM显著提升了检索精度和一致性，性能提升最高达10.17%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: PECM有效解决了医学数据中的模糊性问题，提升了复杂临床场景下的检索可靠性。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

Conclusion: MAUP策略有效利用了预训练的自然图像模型，为跨域少样本医学图像分割提供了高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles

distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种开源大规模数据集，用于将口语数学表达式转换为LaTeX，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著改进。


<details>

Motivation: 解决口语数学表达式转换为LaTeX的挑战，特别是在教育和研究领域的应用需求。

Method: 基于ASR后校正模型和音频语言模型，结合大规模标注数据集（英语和俄语）。

Result: 在MathSpeech和S2L-equations基准测试中分别取得28%和27%的CER，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 为数学内容识别的多模态AI研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

Motivation: 传统方法（如捕获-再捕获、距离采样或相机陷阱）劳动密集或空间受限，无人机提供了一种高效、非侵入性的替代方案。

Method: 在无叶期进行无人机飞行，使用热成像和RGB图像手动标注动物，并通过三种外推方法估算密度，同时与相机陷阱的随机遭遇模型（REM）对比。

Result: 无人机方法估算的密度与REM相似，但通常更高，反映了白天开放和森林区域的活动差异。

Conclusion: 无人机为野生动物密度估算提供了一种有前景且可扩展的方法，与传统方法互补。

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模因匹配方法主要基于共享视觉背景（模板），忽视了非模板模因的匹配需求，限制了模因分析的全面性和自动化效果。

Method: 论文引入了超越模板匹配的模因匹配方法，比较了传统相似性度量（包括分段计算）和多模态大语言模型的效果。

Result: 传统方法在模板模因上表现良好，但对非模板模因效果有限；分段计算优于全图度量；多模态大语言模型展示了潜力。

Conclusion: 准确匹配共享视觉元素的模因仍是一个开放挑战，需要更复杂的匹配技术。

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

Result: 在爱尔兰历史地图上验证了高性能和效率，发现了一处可能在大饥荒时期废弃的聚落。

Conclusion: 该方法为历史和考古研究提供了高效工具，展示了其在发现潜在历史遗迹方面的潜力。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

Motivation: 雷达姿态估计具有隐私保护和光照不变性优势，但受噪声和多路径效应影响，需解决数据不确定性建模问题。

Method: 采用变分推断的概率编码器-解码器架构，处理MIMO雷达数据，预测三维关节位置及不确定性，支持高斯和拉普拉斯分布建模。

Conclusion: RadProPoser首次实现端到端雷达姿态估计与不确定性量化，为可靠的人体运动分析奠定基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Method: 建立了金属透镜内窥镜数据集，提出MetaScope网络，包含光学信息强度调整（OIA）和光学信息色差校正（OCC）两种设计，并通过梯度引导蒸馏增强联合学习。

Result: MetaScope在金属透镜分割和恢复任务中优于现有方法，并在真实生物医学场景中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MetaScope成功填补了金属透镜内窥镜的研究空白，为超微成像提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Conclusion: CloudBreaker为多光谱数据不可靠或不可用的遥感应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Conclusion: evTransFER框架显著提升了事件相机在表情识别中的性能，证明了迁移学习的有效性。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D

Conclusion: LongVie为可控超长视频生成提供了高效解决方案，显著提升生成质量与一致性。

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,

*Pulkit Kumar,Shuaiyi Huang,Matthew Walmer,Sai Saketh Rambhatla,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Trokens提出了一种将轨迹点转化为语义感知关系标记的方法，用于少样本动作识别，结合语义感知采样和运动建模框架，在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要有效建模运动和外观信息，但现有方法在点跟踪和运动模式建模上存在挑战。

Method: 采用语义感知采样策略和运动建模框架（HoD和轨迹关系建模），结合轨迹标记与语义特征。

Result: 在六个少样本动作识别基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Trokens通过语义感知和运动建模有效提升了少样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

*Jingpu Yang*

TL;DR: UAV-FPG是一种基于博弈论的环境模型，用于模拟无人机通信频段中干扰与抗干扰策略的动态交互，结合专家知识库和大型语言模型优化频率选择和路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管无人机在通信稳定性和安全性方面取得了进展，但在频谱竞争建模、专家知识整合和对手行为预测方面仍存在挑战。

Method: 提出UAV-FPG模型，结合专家知识库优化频率选择，利用大型语言模型进行路径规划，模拟“强对手”的动态交互。

Result: 实验表明，专家知识库和大型语言模型的结合显著提升了动态场景中的路径规划效果，优于固定路径策略。

Conclusion: UAV-FPG为无人机通信系统的抗干扰策略和智能决策提供了强大平台。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have made significant advancements in
communication stability and security through techniques such as frequency
hopping, signal spreading, and adaptive interference suppression. However,
challenges remain in modeling spectrum competition, integrating expert
knowledge, and predicting opponent behavior. To address these issues, we
propose UAV-FPG (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Frequency Point Game), a
game-theoretic environment model that simulates the dynamic interaction between
interference and anti-interference strategies of opponent and ally UAVs in
communication frequency bands. The model incorporates a prior expert knowledge
base to optimize frequency selection and employs large language models for path
planning, simulating a "strong adversary". Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of integrating the expert knowledge base and the large language
model, with the latter significantly improving path planning in dynamic
scenarios through iterative interactions, outperforming fixed-path strategies.
UAV-FPG provides a robust platform for advancing anti-jamming strategies and
intelligent decision-making in UAV communication systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的代理建模方法TransAM，通过局部轨迹学习其他代理的策略表示，在多代理环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要其他代理的完整轨迹，这在现实中不切实际，因此需要一种仅基于局部轨迹的鲁棒代理建模方法。

Method: 提出TransAM，一种基于Transformer的方法，将局部轨迹编码为嵌入空间以捕捉其他代理的策略。

Result: 在合作、竞争和混合多代理环境中，TransAM生成强策略表示，提升代理建模效果，并带来更高的回合回报。

Conclusion: TransAM是一种有效的代理建模方法，适用于多种多代理环境。

Abstract: Agent modeling is a critical component in developing effective policies
within multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to form beliefs about the
behaviors, intentions, and competencies of others. Many existing approaches
assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often
unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent
modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the
other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In
this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent
modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that
effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance
of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent
environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to
higher episodic returns.

Conclusion: 工程化通信策略在复杂多智能体任务中更具优势。

Abstract: We compare the efficacy of learned versus engineered communication strategies
in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. For the
learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents
generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered
approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation
Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages
based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their
success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable
conditions. Our findings indicate that while emergent communication is viable,
the engineered approach demonstrates superior performance and scalability,
particularly as environmental complexity increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体在长期运行系统中需要持续可靠性，而现有模型（如有限或折扣模型）无法完全满足这一需求。

Method: 通过建立多智能体与单智能体之间的联系，推导鲁棒Bellman方程的可解性，并证明鲁棒纳什均衡的存在性。提出鲁棒Nash-Iteration算法计算均衡。

Result: 证明了鲁棒纳什均衡的存在性，并展示了平均奖励纳什均衡与折扣纳什均衡之间的联系。

Conclusion: 为复杂、不确定、长期运行的多智能体环境提供了理论和算法基础，未来可扩展到多智能体鲁棒平均奖励问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces the formulation of a distributionally robust Markov
game (DR-MG) with average rewards, a crucial framework for multi-agent
decision-making under uncertainty over extended horizons. Unlike finite-horizon
or discounted models, the average-reward criterion naturally captures long-term
performance for systems designed for continuous operation, where sustained
reliability is paramount. We account for uncertainty in transition kernels,
with players aiming to optimize their worst-case average reward. We first
establish a connection between the multi-agent and single agent settings, and
derive the solvability of the robust Bellman equation under the average-reward
formulation. We then rigorously prove the existence of a robust Nash
Equilibrium (NE), offering essential theoretical guarantees for system
stability. We further develop and analyze an algorithm named robust
Nash-Iteration to compute the robust Nash Equilibria among all agents,
providing practical tools for identifying optimal strategies in complex,
uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments. Finally, we demonstrate
the connection between the average-reward NE and the well-studied discounted
NEs, showing that the former can be approximated as the discount factor
approaches one. Together, these contributions provide a comprehensive
theoretical and algorithmic foundation for identifying optimal strategies in
complex, uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments, which allow for
the future extension of robust average-reward single-agent problems to the
multi-agent setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升语音助手的自然用户体验，需要区分用户查询与背景语音或侧边对话。

Method: 采用自适应知识蒸馏方法，从预训练的大规模ASR声学编码器（教师模型）中提取通用表征，并结合任务特定的适配器与学生模型联合训练。

Result: 在关键词和非关键词（后续）调用中，该方法比无蒸馏的学生模型分别提高了26%和19%的等错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法在基于Transformer和Conformer的模型架构中均表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Device-directed speech detection (DDSD) is a binary classification task that
separates the user's queries to a voice assistant (VA) from background speech
or side conversations. This is important for achieving naturalistic user
experience. To this end, we propose knowledge distillation (KD) to enhance DDSD
accuracy while ensuring efficient deployment. Specifically, we introduce a
novel adaptive KD method that transfers knowledge from general representations
of an ASR large pre-trained acoustic encoder (teacher). We apply task-specific
adapters, on top of the (frozen) teacher encoder, trained jointly with the
student model on DDSD. We demonstrate that the proposed adaptive KD outperforms
the student model without distillation in the keyword and keyword-free
(follow-up) invocations, with an improvement of +26% and +19% in terms of Equal
Error Rate, respectively. We also show that this approach generalizes across
the transformer and conformer-based model architectures.

Motivation: 解决大规模人工标记数据集难以获取的问题，探索人类反馈对TSE性能的提升。

Method: 生成合成数据集，训练模型；采用噪声功率掩码和概率阈值方法。

Result: 基于噪声功率掩码的模型表现最佳，用户偏好优化后的输出。

Conclusion: 人类反馈迭代优化是提升神经语音提取性能的有效方法。

Abstract: We present the first neural target speech extraction (TSE) system that uses
human feedback for iterative refinement. Our approach allows users to mark
specific segments of the TSE output, generating an edit mask. The refinement
system then improves the marked sections while preserving unmarked regions.
Since large-scale datasets of human-marked errors are difficult to collect, we
generate synthetic datasets using various automated masking functions and train
models on each. Evaluations show that models trained with noise power-based
masking (in dBFS) and probabilistic thresholding perform best, aligning with
human annotations. In a study with 22 participants, users showed a preference
for refined outputs over baseline TSE. Our findings demonstrate that
human-in-the-loop refinement is a promising approach for improving the
performance of neural speech extraction.

Conclusion: TF-MLPNet为可穿戴设备提供了高效的实时语音分离解决方案。

Abstract: Speech separation on hearable devices can enable transformative augmented and
enhanced hearing capabilities. However, state-of-the-art speech separation
networks cannot run in real-time on tiny, low-power neural accelerators
designed for hearables, due to their limited compute capabilities. We present
TF-MLPNet, the first speech separation network capable of running in real-time
on such low-power accelerators while outperforming existing streaming models
for blind speech separation and target speech extraction. Our network operates
in the time-frequency domain, processing frequency sequences with stacks of
fully connected layers that alternate along the channel and frequency
dimensions, and independently processing the time sequence at each frequency
bin using convolutional layers. Results show that our mixed-precision
quantization-aware trained (QAT) model can process 6 ms audio chunks in
real-time on the GAP9 processor, achieving a 3.5-4x runtime reduction compared
to prior speech separation models.

Motivation: 扩散模型生成高质量语音但效率低，难以实时应用，且对语调和节奏建模存在挑战。

Result: 在WaveGrad 2模型上测试，DLPO在客观指标（UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02）和主观评估（67%偏好）中表现优异。

Conclusion: DLPO为实时、资源受限环境下的高效高质量TTS提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high-fidelity speech but are inefficient for
real-time use due to long denoising steps and challenges in modeling intonation
and rhythm. To improve this, we propose Diffusion Loss-Guided Policy
Optimization (DLPO), an RLHF framework for TTS diffusion models. DLPO
integrates the original training loss into the reward function, preserving
generative capabilities while reducing inefficiencies. Using naturalness scores
as feedback, DLPO aligns reward optimization with the diffusion model's
structure, improving speech quality. We evaluate DLPO on WaveGrad 2, a
non-autoregressive diffusion-based TTS model. Results show significant
improvements in objective metrics (UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02) and subjective
evaluations, with DLPO audio preferred 67\% of the time. These findings
demonstrate DLPO's potential for efficient, high-quality diffusion TTS in
real-time, resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Speech synthesis from intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals offers a promising
avenue for restoring communication in individuals with severe speech
impairments. However, achieving intelligible and natural speech remains
challenging due to limitations in feature representation, prosody modeling, and
phase reconstruction. We introduce MiSTR, a deep-learning framework that
integrates: 1) Wavelet-based feature extraction to capture fine-grained
temporal, spectral, and neurophysiological representations of iEEG signals, 2)
A Transformer-based decoder for prosody-aware spectrogram prediction, and 3) A

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在日常生活中的广泛应用，音频成为人机交互的关键接口，但也带来了新的安全漏洞。

Method: 第一阶段使用基于奖励的优化方法RL-PGD绕过模型的安全协议；第二阶段通过PGD将扰动嵌入良性音频载体。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Omni-3B等模型上验证，攻击成功率达86%以上。

Conclusion: WhisperInject揭示了音频原生威胁的可行性，为AI行为操纵提供了隐蔽方法。

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life,
audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this
convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential
attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a
two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate
state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method
uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human
listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method,
Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the
target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native
responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2,
Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize
subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as
weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous
StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation
framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across
Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a
new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical
exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非专业环境下音乐录音中常见的音频质量问题，如混响、失真、削波等，避免使用多个工具和手动调整。

Method: 基于自然语言指令的生成模型，利用流匹配生成训练范式，训练数据为模拟退化的高质量音频对。

Result: 在客观音频质量指标和主观听力测试中，SonicMaster显著提升了音频质量。

Conclusion: SonicMaster提供了一种有效的统一方法，用于音乐修复和母带处理。

Abstract: Music recordings often suffer from audio quality issues such as excessive
reverberation, distortion, clipping, tonal imbalances, and a narrowed stereo
image, especially when created in non-professional settings without specialized
equipment or expertise. These problems are typically corrected using separate
specialized tools and manual adjustments. In this paper, we introduce
SonicMaster, the first unified generative model for music restoration and
mastering that addresses a broad spectrum of audio artifacts with text-based
control. SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply
targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general
restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large
dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common
degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five
enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our
approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an
audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered
versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate
that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact
categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners
prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over the original degraded audio,
highlighting the effectiveness of our unified approach.

TL;DR: EmoSteer-TTS提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过激活导向实现细粒度的语音情感控制（转换、插值、擦除）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS系统在情感控制上存在局限性，如依赖离散标签或复杂提示，且需要大量高质量数据训练。

Method: 通过修改流匹配TTS模型的内部激活子集，提出无需训练的算法（激活提取、情感标记搜索、推理时导向）。

Result: 实验表明，EmoSteer-TTS在细粒度、可解释和连续情感控制上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 这是首个实现无需训练且连续细粒度情感控制的TTS方法。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has shown great progress in recent years. However, most
existing TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via
discrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text
prompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or
unstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for
training. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel
training-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control
(conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first
empirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within
a flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of
synthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free
and efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token
searching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into
a wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In
addition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated
emotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and
continuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art
(SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves
training-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管网络安全防御技术有所进步，但网络攻击仍无法完全避免。现有决策框架通常忽略成功攻击后的清理成本，因此需要研究如何在预防和反应防御之间分配资源。

Method: 通过建模资源分配问题，分析传感器信号质量对防御策略的影响，探讨预防性和反应性防御的最优投资比例。

Result: 研究发现，传感器质量越高，预防性防御的投入应增加，反应性防御的投入减少。此外，当攻击成功率较低时，防御性能的提升最为显著。

Conclusion: 传感器信号质量对防御资源分配策略有重要影响，优化投资比例可显著提升防御效果。

Abstract: Cyber attacks continue to be a cause of concern despite advances in cyber
defense techniques. Although cyber attacks cannot be fully prevented, standard
decision-making frameworks typically focus on how to prevent them from
succeeding, without considering the cost of cleaning up the damages incurred by
successful attacks. This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation
problem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its
investment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks,
and reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes.
This encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the
observation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this
uncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate
how the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment
in the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be
achieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive
resources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with
higher sensor quality. We also show that the defender's performance
improvement, relative to a baseline of no sensors employed, is maximal when the
attacker can only achieve low attack success probabilities.

Abstract: Recurrent equilibrium networks (RENs) are effective for learning the dynamics
of complex dynamical systems with certified contraction and robustness
properties through unconstrained learning. While this opens the door to
learning large-scale RENs, deploying such large-scale RENs in real-time
applications on resource-limited devices remains challenging. Since a REN
consists of a feedback interconnection of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics
and static activation functions, this article proposes a projection-based
approach to reduce the state dimension of the LTI component of a trained REN.
One of the two projection matrices is dedicated to preserving contraction and
robustness by leveraging the already-learned REN contraction certificate. The
other projection matrix is iteratively updated to improve the accuracy of the
reduced-order REN based on necessary $h_2$-optimality conditions for LTI model
reduction. Numerical examples validate the approach, demonstrating significant
state dimension reduction with limited accuracy loss while preserving
contraction and robustness.

Abstract: Vehicle suspension is important for passengers to travel comfortably and to
be less exposed to effects such as vibration and shock. A good suspension
system in-creases the road holding of vehicles, allows them to take turns
safely and reduces the risk of traffic accidents. Passive suspension system is
the most widely used suspension system in vehicles due to its simple structure
and low cost. Passive suspension systems do not have an actuator and therefore
do not have a controller. Active suspension systems have an actuator and a
controller. Although their structures are more complex and costly, they are
safer. PID controller is widely used in active suspension systems due to its
simple structure, reasonable cost and easy adjustment of coefficients. In this
study, a more robust LQR controlled active suspension was designed than passive
sus-pension and PID controlled active suspension. Robustness analyses were
performed for passive suspension, PID controlled active suspension and LQR
controlled active sus-pension. Suspension travel, sprung mass acceleration and
sprung mass motion simulations were performed for all 3 suspensions under road
disturbance and under simultaneous road disturbance and parameter uncertainty.
A comparative analysis was performed by obtaining the suspension rise time,
overshoot and settling time data. It was observed that the LQR controlled
active suspension showed the least overshoot and had the shortest settling

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种考虑供应链约束的发电扩展规划模型（SC-GEP），优化长期投资并解决材料、生产等限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型常忽视供应链限制，导致资源延迟和系统可靠性问题，需改进。

Method: 采用多阶段SC-GEP模型，结合分解算法求解混合整数线性规划（MILP）。

Result: 案例研究表明供应链约束影响技术选择、增加成本，并可能导致电力短缺。

Conclusion: 长期规划需整合上游供应链约束以确保系统可靠性。

Abstract: Rising electricity demand underscores the need for secure and reliable
generation expansion planning that accounts for upstream supply chain
constraints. Traditional models often overlook limitations in materials,
manufacturing capacity, lead times for deployment, and field availability,
which can delay availability of planned resources and thus to threaten system
reliability. This paper introduces a multi-stage supply chain-constrained
generation expansion planning (SC-GEP) model that optimizes long-term
investments while capturing material availability, production limits, spatial
and temporal constraints, and material reuse from retired assets. A
decomposition algorithm efficiently solves the resulting MILP. A Maryland case
study shows that supply chain constraints shift technology choices, amplify
deployment delays caused by lead times, and prompt earlier investment in
shorter lead-time, low-material-intensity options. In the low-demand scenario,
supply chain constraints raise investment costs by $1.2 billion. Under high
demand, persistent generation and reserve shortfalls emerge, underscoring the
need to integrate upstream constraints into long-term planning.

Conclusion: 通过优化时间离散化网格密度，可以显著提高随机微分方程数值解的精度和效率。

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the numerical integration of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) which govern diffusion processes driven by a
standard Wiener process. With the latter being replaced by a sequence of
increments at discrete moments of time, we revisit a filtering point of view on
the approximate strong solution of the SDE as an estimate of the hidden system
state whose conditional probability distribution is updated using a Bayesian
approach and Brownian bridges over the intermediate time intervals. For a class
of multivariable linear SDEs, where the numerical solution is organised as a
Kalman filter, we investigate the fine-grid asymptotic behaviour of terminal
and integral mean-square error functionals when the time discretisation is
specified by a sufficiently smooth monotonic transformation of a uniform grid.
This leads to constrained optimisation problems over the time discretisation
profile, and their solutions reveal a 1/3 power law for the asymptotically
optimal grid density functions. As a one-dimensional example, the results are
illustrated for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

Result: 仿真验证了框架的鲁棒性和有效性，显著降低碰撞概率，同时保持协调效率。

Conclusion: 该框架在不确定和带宽受限的实际条件下表现优越，提高了安全性和资源利用率。

Abstract: Cooperative vehicle coordination at unsignalized intersections has garnered
significant interest from both academia and industry in recent years,
highlighting its notable advantages in improving traffic throughput and fuel
efficiency. However, most existing studies oversimplify the coordination
system, assuming accurate vehicle state information and ideal state update
process. The oversights pose driving risks in the presence of state uncertainty
and communication constraint. To address this gap, we propose a robust and
comprehensive intersection coordination framework consisting of a robust
cooperative trajectory planner and a context-aware status update scheduler. The
trajectory planner directly controls the evolution of the trajectory
distributions during frequent vehicle interactions, thereby offering
probabilistic safety guarantees. To further align with coordination safety in
practical bandwidth-limited conditions, we propose a context-aware status
update scheduler that dynamically prioritizes the state updating order of
vehicles based on their driving urgency. Simulation results validate the
robustness and effectiveness of the proposed coordination framework, showing
that the collision probability can be significantly reduced while maintaining
comparable coordination efficiency to state-of-theart strategies. Moreover, our
proposed framework demonstrates superior effectiveness in utilizing wireless
resources in practical uncertain and bandwidth-limited conditions.

Conclusion: 所提事件测量正观测器设计方法在保证非负性和稳定性的同时，有效解决了带宽限制问题。

Abstract: This article addresses the problem of state observer design for
continuous-time linear positive networked systems. Considering the bandwidth
constraint in the communication network, an event-measurement-based positive
observer design is proposed. The physical interpretation of a positive observer
differs from that of a general observer. Its primary goal is to ensure that all
state estimates remain non-negative at all times. Using output measurements, a
law with weighted sampling error is used to determine the sampling sequence
between the system and the observer. The observer dynamics are designed using
the standard Luenberger structure with the event-based sampled output
information, which is updated only when an event occurs. Assuming observability
and sufficient conditions for the positivity of the system, the asymptotic
stability of the observer dynamics with sampled information is established.
Sufficient conditions of stability and positivity are derived using linear
matrix inequalities. Moreover, the design ensures that the event-based
architecture is free from Zeno behavior, ensuring a positive minimum bound on
the inter-execution time. In addition, numerical simulations on a three-tank
system having variable cross-sections are used to demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed event-based positive observer.

Motivation: 电网连接转换器的控制策略需要处理电网故障场景，如对称和非对称短路故障，以确保转换器能提供故障电流并保持同步。

Method: 扩展GFVCC控制方案，以模块化方式引入负序环路，并提出针对对称和非对称故障的FRT策略。

Result: 通过案例研究（包括无限总线设置和多单元电网）验证了所提FRT策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的FRT策略能够有效支持电网形成行为，并在故障条件下保持转换器的同步性和硬件限制。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that operating grid-connected converters using the
grid-forming vector current control (GFVCC) scheme offers significant benefits,
including the simplicity and modularity of the control architecture, as well as
enabling a seamless transition from PLL-based grid-following control to
grid-forming. An important aspect of any grid-connected converter control
strategy is the handling of grid-fault scenarios such as symmetrical and
asymmetrical short-circuit faults. This paper presents several fault
ride-through (FRT) strategies for GFVCC that enable the converter to provide
fault current and stay synchronized to the grid while respecting the converter
hardware limitations and retaining grid-forming behavior. The converter control
scheme is extended in a modular manner to include negative-sequence loops, and
the proposed FRT strategies address both symmetrical and asymmetrical faults.
The proposed FRT strategies are analyzed through case studies, including
infinite-bus setups and multi-unit grids.

Conclusion: 论文证明了基于学习的控制方法在混合动力农业拖拉机中的有效性，并提出改进训练效率的具体策略。

Abstract: The variable and unpredictable load demands in hybrid agricultural tractors
make it difficult to design optimal rule-based energy management strategies,
motivating the use of adaptive, learning-based control. However, existing
approaches often rely on basic fuel-based rewards and do not leverage expert
demonstrations to accelerate training. In this paper, first, the performance of
Q-value-based reinforcement learning algorithms is evaluated for powertrain
control in a hybrid agricultural tractor. Three algorithms, Double Q-Learning
(DQL), Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Double DQN (DDQN), are compared in terms of
convergence speed and policy optimality. Second, a piecewise domain-specific
reward-shaping strategy is introduced to improve learning efficiency and steer
agent behavior toward engine fuel-efficient operating regions. Third, the
design of the experience replay buffer is examined, with a focus on the effects
of seeding the buffer with expert demonstrations and analyzing how different
types of expert policies influence convergence dynamics and final performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that (1) DDQN achieves 70\% faster convergence
than DQN in this application domain, (2) the proposed reward shaping method
effectively biases the learned policy toward fuel-efficient outcomes, and (3)
initializing the replay buffer with structured expert data leads to a 33\%
improvement in convergence speed.

Method: 分析了贪婪算法在自适应对手下的表现，研究了非自适应对手下的随机分配，并提出基于最大物品价值预测的算法。

Result: 贪婪算法在自适应对手下无效，随机分配在非自适应对手下有效，预测算法能实现鲁棒近似。

Conclusion: PROP1在特定条件下可近似，但更强公平性概念即使有完美预测仍难以实现。

Abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior
work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic
fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this
setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a
natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved.
We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any
positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This
is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and
a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under
additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of
non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of
learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the
simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation
with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust
approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item
value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as
EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.

Abstract: Wearable assistive devices are increasingly becoming softer. Modelling their
interface with human tissue is necessary to capture transmission of dynamic
assistance. However, their nonlinear and compliant nature makes both physical
modeling and embedded sensing challenging. In this paper, we develop a
image-based, learning-based framework to estimate distributed contact forces
for a finger-exosuit system. We used the SoRoSim toolbox to generate a diverse
dataset of exosuit geometries and actuation scenarios for training. The method
accurately estimated interaction forces across multiple contact locations from
low-resolution grayscale images, was able to generalize to unseen shapes and
actuation levels, and remained robust under visual noise and contrast
variations. We integrated the model into a feedback controller, and found that
the vision-based estimator functions as a surrogate force sensor for
closed-loop control. This approach could be used as a non-intrusive alternative
for real-time force estimation for exosuits.

Conclusion: 可调腿部刚度能够有效提升垂直跳跃机器人在不同地面条件下的能量效率，为未来控制器设计提供了参考。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable
Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time
tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various
ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By
adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric
for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform
better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while
stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and
energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the
best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground
stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state
hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our
hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in
controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides
insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting
leg stiffness.

Abstract: Animal welfare education could greatly benefit from customized robots to help

workshops with animal welfare educators and children to identify key
requirements for zoomorphic robots from their perspectives. Our findings
encompass a zoomorphic robot's appearance, behavior, and features, as well as
concepts for a narrative surrounding the robot. Through comparing and
contrasting the two groups, we find the importance of: negative reactions to
undesirable behavior from children; using the facial features and tail to
provide cues signaling an animal's internal state; and a natural, furry
appearance and texture. We also contribute some novel activities for
Participatory Design with children, including branching storyboards inspired by
thematic apperception tests and interactive narratives, and reflect on some of
the key design challenges of achieving consensus between the groups, despite
much overlap in their design concepts.

Abstract: Imagine a robot controller with the ability to adapt like human synapses,
dynamically rewiring itself to overcome unforeseen challenges in real time.
This paper proposes a novel zero-shot adaptation mechanism for evolutionary
robotics, merging a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) controller with online
Hebbian plasticity. Inspired by biological systems, the method separates
learning and memory, with the genotype acting as memory and Hebbian updates
handling learning. In our approach, the fitness function is leveraged as a live
scaling factor for Hebbian learning, enabling the robot's neural controller to
adjust synaptic weights on-the-fly without additional training. This adds a
dynamic adaptive layer that activates only during runtime to handle unexpected
environmental changes. After the task, the robot 'forgets' the temporary
adjustments and reverts to the original weights, preserving core knowledge. We
validate this hybrid GA-Hebbian controller on an e-puck robot in a T-maze
navigation task with changing light conditions and obstacles.

Motivation: 现有风险评估方法缺乏可解释性或未具体集成到自动驾驶系统中，CRI旨在填补这一空白。

Method: CRI基于物体运动学和空间关系量化方向性风险，采用动态安全包络和RSS原则，结合概率-最大值融合策略和自适应控制策略。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，CRI显著减少碰撞率（19%车辆碰撞/失败路线，20%碰撞/公里），提升驾驶评分（17%），且运行时开销低（3.6毫秒/决策周期）。

Conclusion: CRI在复杂高风险环境中显著提升安全性和鲁棒性，同时保持模块化和低运行时开销。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk
assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs
coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes
indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses
narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk
Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks
based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting
control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning
within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)
principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation,
and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate
CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using
a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our
collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions
per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a
17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically
significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6
ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially
improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while
maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.

Abstract: This letter presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based framework
for simultaneous and accurate estimation of human gait phase and terrain
geometry using a small set of fabric-based wearable soft sensors, with
efficient adaptation to unseen subjects and strong generalization across
different subjects and terrains. Compared to rigid alternatives such as
inertial measurement units, fabric-based soft sensors improve comfort but
introduce nonlinearities due to hysteresis, placement error, and fabric
deformation. Moreover, inter-subject and inter-terrain variability, coupled
with limited calibration data in real-world deployments, further complicate
accurate estimation. To address these challenges, the proposed framework
integrates MAML into a deep learning architecture to learn a generalizable
model initialization that captures subject- and terrain-invariant structure.
This initialization enables efficient adaptation (i.e., adaptation with only a
small amount of calibration data and a few fine-tuning steps) to new users,
while maintaining strong generalization (i.e., high estimation accuracy across
subjects and terrains). Experiments on nine participants walking at various
speeds over five terrain conditions demonstrate that the proposed framework
outperforms baseline approaches in estimating gait phase, locomotion mode, and
incline angle, with superior accuracy, adaptation efficiency, and
generalization.

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of

introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor
air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a
digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air
filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by
coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like
healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a
robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin
simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to
aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model,
combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach,
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol
concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35
seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform
static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne
pathogen risks.

Abstract: Microplastics, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters, have
become a pervasive environmental contaminant that accumulates on beaches due to
wind patterns and tidal forcing. Detecting microplastics and mapping their
concentration in the wild remains one of the primary challenges in addressing
this environmental issue. This paper introduces a novel robotic platform that
automatically detects and chemically analyzes microplastics on beach surfaces.
This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera
mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments
candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of
organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle
is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto
the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in
real-time. Through experiments in lab and beach environments, the system is
shown to achieve an excellent positional precision in manipulation control and
high microplastic classification accuracy.

Conclusion: 该研究为蛇形机器人运动控制提供了一种新的简化动力学模型，解决了接触和控制的分配问题。

Abstract: Contact-rich problems, such as snake robot locomotion, offer unexplored yet
rich opportunities for optimization-based trajectory and acyclic contact
planning. So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on
emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns
using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or
focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However,
models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are
based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the
challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain
absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations
and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order
model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion
mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including large language models
(LLMs) and hybrid reasoning models present an opportunity to reimagine how
autonomous robots such as drones are designed, developed, and validated. Here,
we demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human
input, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a
real-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed
and demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone
in the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry,
autonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated
through a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line
of code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance,
code complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded
architectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete
command-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles,
though with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context
window and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of
AI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as
emergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work
sets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more
broadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future
robots may be largely co-designed, developed, and verified by artificial
intelligence. In this initial work, a robot built a robot's brain.

Result: 在仿真和实际场景中表现优异，训练高效，规划时间短，轨迹短且成功率高。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种物体上有效，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various
daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the
robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the
cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations
are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert
demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for
practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal
physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks.
Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert
data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered
environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the
robot's grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and
compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that
our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training
compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance
in planning time, trajectory length, and success rates. Our demonstration
videos can be found at https://youtu.be/FaQLkTV9knI.

Result: 通过真实实验和用户研究验证了方法的有效性，能够理解人类偏好并完成物体交递任务。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合人类偏好，提升了人机交递的自然性和流畅性。

Abstract: Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that
aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and
factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on
pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and
explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction
between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target
object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should
grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during
handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects
target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs
the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit
preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences.
We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world
experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of
these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in
handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences. Our
demonstration videos can be found at https://youtu.be/6z27B2INl-s.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文研究了两种方法（基于物理的观测器和神经网络回归模型）用于估算仿生扑翼机器人Aerobat的气动力，目标是为闭环飞行控制提供支持。两种方法在实验中表现一致。


<details>

Motivation: 精确估算气动力对扑翼机器人的控制、建模和设计至关重要，尤其是具有动态变形能力的仿生机器人。

Method: 1. 基于哈密顿力学的物理观测器，利用共轭动量推断气动力；2. 多层感知机（MLP）神经网络回归模型，从运动学和环境参数映射到气动力。

Result: 两种方法在三个力分量（Fx, Fy, Fz）上表现一致，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 两种方法均能有效估算气动力，为仿生扑翼机器人的闭环控制提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of aerodynamic forces is essential for advancing the
control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots with dynamic
morphing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate two distinct methodologies
for force estimation on Aerobat, a bio-inspired flapping-wing platform designed
to emulate the inertial and aerodynamic behaviors observed in bat flight. Our
goal is to quantify aerodynamic force contributions during tethered flight, a
crucial step toward closed-loop flight control. The first method is a
physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics that leverages the
concept of conjugate momentum to infer external aerodynamic forces acting on
the robot. This observer builds on the system's reduced-order dynamic model and
utilizes real-time sensor data to estimate forces without requiring training
data. The second method employs a neural network-based regression model,
specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to learn a mapping from joint
kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters to aerodynamic
force outputs. We evaluate both estimators using a 6-axis load cell in a
high-frequency data acquisition setup that enables fine-grained force
measurements during periodic wingbeats. The conjugate momentum observer and the
regression model demonstrate strong agreement across three force components
(Fx, Fy, Fz).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人课程学习依赖人工设计，耗时且可能不优化；自动化课程学习在简单领域有效，但机器人任务复杂且目标领域分布未知。

Method: GACL框架包含三个创新：任务表示、自适应性能跟踪机制和目标领域相关性保持方法。

Result: 在轮式导航和四足运动任务中，GACL分别比现有方法提高了6.8%和6.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: GACL为复杂机器人任务提供了一种高效且自适应的课程学习方法。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex
robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually
designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer
from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum
learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where
task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique
challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining
relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through
limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning,
a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three
key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex
robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows
adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current
capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain
relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks.
We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and
quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1%
higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each
domain.

Motivation: 探索姿态操纵与推力矢量控制的统一，解决传统四足机器人扭矩控制带宽不足的问题。

Method: 采用解耦控制架构：Raibert控制器负责腿部运动，MPC调节推力器，并通过学习的接触残余动力学（CRD）处理腿-地面碰撞。

Result: 实验验证了解耦控制架构结合CRD在推恢复和猫式步态上表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 解耦控制架构结合CRD有效解决了扭矩控制带宽限制，提升了机器人性能。

Abstract: Husky Carbon, a robot developed by Northeastern University, serves as a
research platform to explore unification of posture manipulation and thrust
vectoring. Unlike conventional quadrupeds, its joint actuators and thrusters
enable enhanced control authority, facilitating thruster-assisted narrow-path
walking. While a unified Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizing
both ground reaction forces and thruster forces could theoretically address
this control problem, its feasibility is limited by the low torque-control
bandwidth of the system's lightweight actuators. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a decoupled control architecture: a Raibert-type controller governs
legged locomotion using position-based control, while an MPC regulates the
thrusters augmented by learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) to account for
leg-ground impacts. This separation bypasses the torque-control rate bottleneck
while retaining the thruster MPC to explicitly account for leg-ground impact
dynamics through learned residuals. We validate this approach through both
simulation and hardware experiments, showing that the decoupled control
architecture with CRD performs more stable behavior in terms of push recovery
and cat-like walking gait compared to the decoupled controller without CRD.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，实现了750毫克扑翼机器人的昆虫级飞行敏捷性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫级飞行机器人目前无法实现类似真实昆虫的高机动性，主要由于低惯性、快速动力学、扑翼空气动力学的不确定性以及对环境干扰的高敏感性。

Method: 设计了深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，并通过模仿学习方法训练了一个双层全连接神经网络，以实现高反馈速率。

Result: 机器人展示了昆虫级的急转动作，横向速度和加速度分别达到197厘米/秒和11.7米/秒²，性能提升了447%和255%。

Conclusion: 该研究在实现昆虫级飞行敏捷性方面取得了里程碑式进展，为未来的传感和计算自主性研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,
saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial
robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body
acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot
inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high
susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers
requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the
hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and
environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube
model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and
robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive
controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To
achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we
design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural
network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of
central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like
saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per
second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$
improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers
under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force
mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11
seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results
represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire
future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.

Conclusion: LiGen首次将光谱指纹与GAN数据增强结合，为室内定位提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and robust indoor localization is critical for smart building
applications, yet existing Wi-Fi-based systems are often vulnerable to
environmental conditions. This work presents a novel indoor localization
system, called LiGen, that leverages the spectral intensity patterns of ambient
light as fingerprints, offering a more stable and infrastructure-free
alternative to radio signals. To address the limited spectral data, we design a
data augmentation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs),
featuring two variants: PointGAN, which generates fingerprints conditioned on
coordinates, and FreeGAN, which uses a weak localization model to label
unconditioned samples. Our positioning model, leveraging a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) architecture to train on synthesized data, achieves
submeter-level accuracy, outperforming Wi-Fi-based baselines by over 50\%.
LiGen also demonstrates strong robustness in cluttered environments. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first system to combine spectral
fingerprints with GAN-based data augmentation for indoor localization.

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优于现有最优规划器，并在仿真和硬件部署中验证了高质量路径规划和实际应用性。

Conclusion: CogniPlan通过生成模型和图注意力机制，有效解决了路径规划中的不确定性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Path planning in unknown environments is a crucial yet inherently challenging
capability for mobile robots, which primarily encompasses two coupled tasks:
autonomous exploration and point-goal navigation. In both cases, the robot must
perceive the environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential
information gain on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose
CogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible
layouts predicted by a COnditional GeNerative Inpainting model, mirroring how
humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on
the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our
planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate strong synergy
between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based path
planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph
representations with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps,
yielding notable performance gains in both exploration and navigation. We
extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic
floor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners. We further
deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and on hardware, showcasing its
high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，比现有方法成功率提高30%，计算成本相近且路径质量高。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时性和安全性上优于现有技术，适用于高效路径规划。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a
learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local
observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be
represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time.
We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a
difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a
non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF,
resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as
the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a
hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.
The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates
compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort
and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

Conclusion: SkeNa任务和SkeNavigator框架为基于草图的导航提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: We propose Hand-Eye Autonomous Delivery (HEAD), a framework that learns
navigation, locomotion, and reaching skills for humanoids, directly from human
motion and vision perception data. We take a modular approach where the
high-level planner commands the target position and orientation of the hands
and eyes of the humanoid, delivered by the low-level policy that controls the
whole-body movements. Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns
to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing
large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human
data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular approach decouples the ego-centric
vision perception from physical actions, promoting efficient learning and
scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both in simulation and in
the real-world, demonstrating humanoid's capabilities to navigate and reach in
complex environments designed for humans.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose theatre-in-the-loop, a framework for developing
expressive robot behaviours tailored to artistic performance through a
director-guided puppeteering workflow. Leveraging theatrical methods, we use
narrative objectives to direct a puppeteer in generating improvised robotic
gestures that convey specific emotions. These improvisations are captured and
curated to build a dataset of reusable movement templates for standalone
playback in future autonomous performances. Initial trials demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach, illustrating how the workflow enables precise
sculpting of robotic gestures into coherent emotional arcs while revealing
challenges posed by the robot's mechanical constraints. We argue that this
practice-led framework provides a model for interdisciplinary teams creating
socially expressive robot behaviours, contributing to (1) theatre as an
interactive training ground for human-robot interaction and (2) co-creation
methodologies between humans and machines.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot

efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely
high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting
gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly
efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct
this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that
despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of
the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third
contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller
that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including
starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller
on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人需要根据自然语言描述在未知环境中执行零样本任务，但现有方法在2D图像中难以精确定位3D动作点。

Method: 提出3D相关性场，绕过高维特征，采用轻量级2D点级指导，并通过多视角聚合解决几何模糊和语义不确定性。

Result: 系统能在20秒内生成空间接地的响应，支持实际操控任务。

Conclusion: Point2Act通过高效3D定位和快速响应，为机器人任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Point2Act, which directly retrieves the 3D action point relevant
for a contextually described task, leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Foundation models opened the possibility for generalist robots that
can perform a zero-shot task following natural language descriptions within an
unseen environment. While the semantics obtained from large-scale image and
language datasets provide contextual understanding in 2D images, the rich yet
nuanced features deduce blurry 2D regions and struggle to find precise 3D
locations for actions. Our proposed 3D relevancy fields bypass the
high-dimensional features and instead efficiently imbue lightweight 2D
point-level guidance tailored to the task-specific action. The multi-view
aggregation effectively compensates for misalignments due to geometric
ambiguities, such as occlusion, or semantic uncertainties inherent in the
language descriptions. The output region is highly localized, reasoning
fine-grained 3D spatial context that can directly transfer to an explicit
position for physical action at the on-the-fly reconstruction of the scene. Our
full-stack pipeline, which includes capturing, MLLM querying, 3D
reconstruction, and grasp pose extraction, generates spatially grounded
responses in under 20 seconds, facilitating practical manipulation tasks.

*Le Qiu,Yusuf Umut Ciftci,Somil Bansal*

TL;DR: MPC-SafeGIL通过在设计阶段注入对抗性扰动增强模仿学习的安全性，利用MPC近似最坏情况扰动，提升策略的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习在安全关键应用中可能因策略错误导致安全问题，需增强其安全性。

Method: 在专家演示中注入对抗性扰动，利用采样MPC近似最坏情况扰动，直接整合安全考虑。

Result: 在四足机器人运动和视觉导航仿真及四旋翼实验中验证了安全性和任务性能的提升。

Conclusion: MPC-SafeGIL通过扰动增强数据收集安全性，提升了模仿学习策略的鲁棒性和安全性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex
robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make
errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in
safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach
that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial
disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader
range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn
robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive
Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to
high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work
that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates
safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach
through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor
navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating
improvements in both safety and task performance. See our website here:

### [178] [Language as Cost: Proactive Hazard Mapping using VLM for Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03138)
*Mintaek Oh,Chan Kim,Seung-Woo Seo,Seong-Woo Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本语言成本映射框架，用于机器人主动预测和规避动态风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航系统依赖静态地图，难以应对动态风险（如突然开门的人），导致反应式而非主动式处理。

Method: 利用预训练VLM解析视觉场景，评估动态风险，并预先分配风险感知导航成本，结合几何障碍地图实现主动规划。

Result: 在模拟和多样化动态环境中的实验表明，该方法显著提高了导航成功率并减少了危险遭遇。

Conclusion: 语言成本映射框架为机器人主动规避动态风险提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively
anticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional
navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for
dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a
result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when
handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language
models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive
hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping
framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential
dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling
robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this
language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only
identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around
potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated
and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters,
compared to reactive baseline planners. Code and supplementary materials are

TL;DR: CookBench是一个专注于复杂烹饪场景中长期规划任务的基准测试，通过高保真模拟环境和精细动作设计，填补现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体现规划基准测试多关注短期任务和粗粒度动作，无法满足复杂物理世界中长期任务的需求。

Method: 利用Unity引擎构建高保真模拟环境，设计两阶段任务（意图识别和体现交互），并提供统一API工具集。

Result: 揭示了当前大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂长期任务中的主要不足。

Conclusion: CookBench将为未来研究提供开放资源，推动长期规划任务的发展。

Abstract: Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of
executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing
embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and
coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce
CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.
By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful
Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic
environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.
First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's
complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the
identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of
physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the
action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational
information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We
provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified
API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing
ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical
interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and
decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of
state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,
revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,
long-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate
future research.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于六足导盲机器人的力-顺应模型预测控制（FC-MPC）和机器人-用户控制屏障函数（CBFs），实现实时双向交互和安全导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为视觉障碍者在复杂环境中提供实时双向交互和安全保障的导航解决方案。

Method: 采用FC-MPC估计用户施加的力和力矩，通过RLS方法调整机器人运动；使用Robot-User CBFs处理障碍物；采用Eight-Way Connected DBSCAN进行障碍物聚类，降低计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明系统能适应用户力指令，同时在复杂环境中保障用户和机器人的安全。

Conclusion: 系统成功整合了力顺应、自主导航和避障功能，适用于复杂环境中的导盲任务。

Abstract: Guiding the visually impaired in complex environments requires real-time
two-way interaction and safety assurance. We propose a Force-Compliance Model
Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for
force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots.
FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and
moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS)
method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User
CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and
dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility
issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected
DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from
O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on
resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum
Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman
filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates
force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental
results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while
guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex
environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出UniFucGrasp，一种通用功能抓取标注策略和数据集，解决了现有数据集忽略功能性抓取的问题，支持低成本高效收集高质量抓取数据。


<details>

Motivation: 现有灵巧抓取数据集过于关注稳定性，忽略了功能性抓取（如开瓶盖、握杯柄），且依赖昂贵难控的高自由度Shadow Hands。

Method: 基于仿生学，将人类自然动作映射到多种手部结构，利用几何力闭合确保功能性和稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了功能性操作的准确性和抓取稳定性，支持跨多种机器人手的高效泛化。

Conclusion: UniFucGrasp解决了灵巧抓取中标注成本和泛化能力的挑战，为功能性抓取提供了新方法。

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly
emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like
opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and
hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's
underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp
annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on
biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses
geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps.
This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality
functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp
dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness.
Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that
our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability,
enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes
annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器人在浑浊水域中导航时，单目视觉方法不可靠且缺乏深度信息，而声纳分辨率低且有高度模糊性。

Method: 通过识别视觉数据中的感兴趣区域并与声纳数据匹配，利用声纳的距离数据和相机的高度数据进行重建。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在不同浑浊度下的有效性，并在码头环境中进行了实地测试。

Conclusion: 该方法在浑浊水域中表现优越，代码已开源以促进复现和社区参与。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction is an essential capability for underwater robots
navigating in close proximity to structures. Monocular vision-based
reconstruction methods are unreliable in turbid waters and lack depth scale
information. Sonars are robust to turbid water and non-uniform lighting
conditions, however, they have low resolution and elevation ambiguity. This
work proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method that is
specially optimized to work in turbid water. Our strategy avoids having to
identify point features in visual data and instead identifies regions of
interest in the data. We then match relevant regions in the image to
corresponding sonar data. A reconstruction is obtained by leveraging range data
from the sonar and elevation data from the camera image. Experimental
comparisons against other vision-based and sonar-based approaches at varying
turbidity levels, and field tests conducted in marina environments, validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have made our code open-source
to facilitate reproducibility and encourage community engagement.

Motivation: 传统机器人操纵任务主要针对小物体，而工厂或家庭环境中常需移动大型物体，缺乏可扩展至任意机器人规模和任务类型的通用框架。

Method: 使用SEEM进行场景分割和目标物体点云提取，提出协作抓取框架（局部抓取位姿生成和全局协作），并设计两阶段规划模块生成无碰撞轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，在不同机器人数量、物体和任务中，框架的成功率为52%。

Conclusion: CollaBot框架在多机器人协作操纵任务中表现出有效性，为解决大型物体移动问题提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: A central research topic in robotics is how to use this system to interact
with the physical world. Traditional manipulation tasks primarily focus on
small objects. However, in factory or home environments, there is often a need
for the movement of large objects, such as moving tables. These tasks typically
require multi-robot systems to work collaboratively. Previous research lacks a
framework that can scale to arbitrary sizes of robots and generalize to various
kinds of tasks. In this work, we propose CollaBot, a generalist framework for
simultaneous collaborative manipulation. First, we use SEEM for scene
segmentation and point cloud extraction of the target object. Then, we propose
a collaborative grasping framework, which decomposes the task into local grasp
pose generation and global collaboration. Finally, we design a 2-stage planning
module that can generate collision-free trajectories to achieve this task.
Experiments show a success rate of 52% across different numbers of robots,
objects, and tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The integration of Automated Delivery Robots (ADRs) into pedestrian-heavy
urban spaces introduces unique challenges in terms of safe, efficient, and
socially acceptable navigation. We develop the complete pipeline for a single
vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation,
and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset
sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and

Motivation: 协作机器人在建筑工地等复杂环境中工作时，振动抑制能力至关重要。研究旨在通过主动抑制外部振动源（如电动工具）引起的振动，提升机器人的性能。

Result: 仿真和实际实验表明，阻尼BMFLC在抑制率和效率上优于原始BMFLC及其递归最小二乘和卡尔曼滤波扩展方法。

Conclusion: 阻尼BMFLC方法显著提升了振动抑制效果，适用于实际应用如抛光任务。

Abstract: Vibration suppression is an important capability for collaborative robots
deployed in challenging environments such as construction sites. We study the
active suppression of vibration caused by external sources such as power tools.
We adopt the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm to
learn the vibration online and counter it by feedforward force control. We
propose the damped BMFLC method, extending BMFLC with a novel adaptive
step-size approach that improves the convergence time and noise resistance. Our
logistic function-based damping mechanism reduces the effect of noise and
enables larger learning rates. We evaluate our method on extensive simulation
experiments with realistic time-varying multi-frequency vibration and
real-world physical interaction experiments. The simulation experiments show
that our method improves the suppression rate in comparison to the original
BMFLC and its recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions.
Furthermore, our method is far more efficient than the latter two. We further
validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world polishing experiments. A

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试中，DiWA仅通过离线适应就提升了八项任务的性能。

Conclusion: DiWA首次实现了基于离线世界模型的扩散策略微调，显著提升了实用性和安全性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Conclusion: Inland-LOAM有效解决了内河航道SLAM的挑战，提升了自主导航的可靠性和实时性，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Accurate geospatial information is crucial for safe, autonomous Inland
Waterway Transport (IWT), as existing charts (IENC) lack real-time detail and
conventional LiDAR SLAM fails in waterway environments. These challenges lead
to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.
  This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It
uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to
mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into
structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling
real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An
automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight,
IENC-compatible format.
  Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior
localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic
maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data
for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据相似性的Voronoi树图算法，通过匹配相似性和优化邻域关系，生成保留邻域信息的树图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Voronoi树图仅展示层次结构，但数据常包含相似性等属性，需一种方法同时表达层次和相似性。

Method: 扩展树图布局流程，利用Kuhn-Munkres匹配相似性与CVT单元，通过贪婪交换优化邻域关系，迭代调整单元大小。

Result: 通过实际案例验证了方法的实用性，定量评估显示树图能有效保留邻域信息。

Conclusion: 该算法成功结合层次结构与数据相似性，为信息可视化提供了新工具。

Abstract: Voronoi treemaps are used to depict nodes and their hierarchical
relationships simultaneously. However, in addition to the hierarchical
structure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities,
frequently exist. Examples include geographical attributes like shared borders
between countries or contextualized semantic information such as embedding
vectors derived from large language models. In this work, we introduce a
Voronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate
neighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline
to consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres
matching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to
create initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy
swapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's
similarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to
their respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods. We
demonstrate the practicality of our approach through multiple real-world
examples drawn from infographics and linguistics. To quantitatively assess the
resulting treemaps, we employ treemap metrics and measure neighborhood
preservation.

Motivation: 扩散模型在说话头生成中速度慢，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用时间VAE压缩视频潜在空间，预训练SpeechAE对齐语音潜在空间，设计A2V-DiT建模，并引入异步噪声调度器（ANS）。

Result: READ在生成质量和速度上优于现有方法，保持长时间生成的稳定性。

Conclusion: READ实现了速度与质量的平衡，为实时说话头生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在特定业务应用中需要高效微调，但现有混合PEFT方法缺乏不确定性量化和动态适应能力。

Method: 提出BH-PEFT方法，结合Adapter、LoRA和prefix-tuning技术，将可学习参数建模为分布以实现不确定性量化，并采用贝叶斯动态微调策略适应新数据。

Conclusion: BH-PEFT为业务分析和数据科学提供了一种支持不确定性感知和自适应决策的新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出ZetA是为了改进Adam优化器，通过动态缩放和混合更新机制提升深度学习任务的性能。

Method: ZetA结合自适应阻尼、余弦相似性动量增强、熵正则化损失和SAM式扰动。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，ZetA比Adam表现更好，尤其在噪声或高粒度分类任务中。

Conclusion: ZetA是Adam的高效替代方案，适用于复杂或噪声环境下的深度学习任务。

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam
by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the
best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient
scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization
and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive
damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss,
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical
evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently
show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight
fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings.
The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust
alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity
classification tasks.

Motivation: 将传统医疗转变为更精准的个性化范式，同时保留群体级ECG合成的优势。

Method: 第一阶段通过对比学习提取个体特征，第二阶段通过AdaX条件注入器将个体特征和心脏条件整合到扩散生成过程中。

Result: 模型能生成高保真、多样化的ECG信号，并保留个体特征，增强下游自动诊断能力。

Conclusion: ECGTwin展示了精准个性化医疗解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

TL;DR: MinConvLSTM和MinConvGRU是两种新型时空模型，结合了卷积循环网络的空间归纳偏置和高效训练的最小化并行RNN。通过扩展MinLSTM和MinGRU的log域前缀和公式到卷积架构，实现了完全并行训练，同时保留局部空间建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ConvRNN模型在训练中因顺序隐藏状态更新导致的效率瓶颈，同时保持空间建模能力。

Method: 将MinLSTM和MinGRU的log域前缀和公式扩展到卷积架构，引入xLSTM启发的指数门控机制，简化log域计算。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes动力学和真实世界位势数据任务中，训练速度显著优于标准ConvLSTM和ConvGRU，预测误差更低。

Conclusion: 最小化循环结构与卷积输入聚合结合，为时空序列建模提供了高效且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

Method: 使用LSTM和Transformer模型，结合特征工程（如GLM、Elo评分等），并比较Binary Cross-Entropy和Brier损失函数的效果。

Result: Transformer模型在分类性能上表现更好（AUC 0.8473），而LSTM模型在概率校准上更优（Brier分数0.1589）。

Conclusion: 模型架构和损失函数的选择需根据预测任务的具体需求，研究为体育分析提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast
the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball
tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two
sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented
through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics
derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences,
and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability
of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy
(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier
loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of
0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate
model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of
forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a
reproducible framework for future predictive modeling tasks in sports analytics

Result: 理论分析表明，RONAVI算法能实现低遗憾并高效找到最优鲁棒策略。

Conclusion: RONAVI为开发真正鲁棒的多智能体系统提供了新的实用路径。

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

Motivation: FeFETs的随机性对建模提出挑战，现有方法无法完全捕捉其变异性或缺乏数学平滑性。

Method: 采用MDN基础，结合C-infinity连续激活函数和设备特定嵌入层，生成合成设备实例进行模拟。

Result: 模型在捕捉FeFET电流行为变异性方面表现出高准确性（R2=0.92）。

Conclusion: 该框架为FeFETs的随机行为建模提供了可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，并为未来模型开发和电路模拟集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a
Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on
false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.
DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across
seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,
representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables

spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through
a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement

traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of
FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds.
Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB,
along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

Motivation: 现有KV缓存驱逐方法在长上下文场景中面临动态注意力模式适应不足和边际信息过度压缩的问题，影响了LLM的性能。

Method: 设计了两种补偿机制，利用不同规模LLM间注意力矩阵的高相似性，提出SmallKV方法，通过小模型辅助感知全局重要信息和近似边际令牌的注意力分数。

Result: 在GSM8K、BBH、MT-Bench和LongBench等基准测试中验证了SmallKV的有效性，吞吐量比基线方法高1.75-2.56倍。

Conclusion: SmallKV在资源受限环境中实现了高效且高性能的LLM推理，具有显著的应用潜力。

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

Result: 在13个真实世界基准测试中，DMSC表现出最优的性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: DMSC通过动态多尺度协调和自适应融合机制，显著提升了时间序列预测的建模能力，成为当前最优方法。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

Result: 在图像-文本和视频-文本检索任务中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 多提示嵌入方法能有效增强语义表示，提升对比学习性能。

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models
have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design

Result: SEM方法在评估准确性和策略方差方面优于传统方法，尤其在大偏移情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: SEM方法在模型充分指定的情况下能学习到最优策略，显著提升了分布鲁棒评估和学习的性能。

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

Motivation: 改进PPO算法，消除对评论家的依赖，同时保持性能，并通过理论分析验证方法的有效性。

Method: GRPO用组归一化奖励替代PPO的价值函数，保留令牌级重要性采样；TIC GRPO进一步用轨迹级概率比替代令牌级重要性比。

Result: 实验表明GRPO的偏差影响有限，TIC GRPO提供无偏梯度估计，性能与标准GRPO相当。

Conclusion: GRPO和TIC GRPO是有效的无评论家强化学习方法，TIC GRPO在理论上有更优的梯度估计性质。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed
variant.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物启发的自适应抗体设计框架，通过多专家系统和在线元学习优化抗体生成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体设计方法采用统一生成策略，无法适应不同抗原的独特需求，受B细胞亲和力成熟启发，提出自适应优化框架。

Method: 利用物理知识的多专家系统（如范德华力、分子识别等），通过在线元学习动态调整参数，模拟自然抗体优化循环。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能发现针对不同抗原的最优策略，显著提升热点覆盖和界面质量，并实现多目标平衡优化。

Conclusion: 该框架为抗体设计提供了自适应迭代优化的新范式，适用于多样化的设计挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

Method: 提出一种新特性来区分对抗文本和干净文本，并基于此设计FilterRAG和ML-FilterRAG方法，过滤对抗文本。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估表明，这两种方法能有效防御攻击，性能接近原始RAG系统。

Conclusion: FilterRAG和ML-FilterRAG是有效的防御手段，能显著降低PoisonedRAG攻击的风险。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

Motivation: 软件系统复杂性增加导致网络安全漏洞激增，需要高效且可扩展的漏洞评估解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 粒子群优化优化紧凑学生模型架构；2) 知识蒸馏将关键知识从大型教师模型传递给学生模型。

Result: 在增强的MegaVul数据集上，模型大小减少99.4%，保留89.3%准确率，训练时间减少72.1%。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源效率、准确性和速度上均优于现有方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while
retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The
framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by
34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.

Result: 实验验证SkyGP在性能和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SkyGP为实时流数据提供了一种高效且性能优越的高斯过程解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible
modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function
approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently
incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 作为参数高效的神经网络替代方案，在无监督故障检测中表现出色，尤其是 WavKAN-AE 和 EfficientKAN-AE 在数据效率上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 KANs 在无监督故障检测中的潜力，尤其是在化学过程中，以验证其数据效率和性能。

Method: 比较四种 KAN-AE 变体（EfficientKAN, FastKAN, FourierKAN, WavKAN）与正交自编码器（OAE）在 Tennessee Eastman Process 上的表现，使用故障检测率（FDR）作为指标。

Result: WavKAN-AE 在 4,000 样本下 FDR ≥92%，EfficientKAN-AE 在 500 样本下 FDR ≥90%，FastKAN-AE 在大规模数据下表现良好，FourierKAN-AE 表现较差。OAE 需要更多数据才能匹配 KAN-AEs。

Conclusion: KAN-AEs 在数据效率和故障检测性能上表现优异，适合数据受限的工业场景，同时具有模型透明度的潜力。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

Motivation: 传统评估方法依赖静态基准测试，无法适应动态用户需求和现实变化，GrandJury旨在提供一种更灵活、透明的评估方式。

Method: 采用时间衰减聚合、完整可追溯性、动态透明任务评分和多评分者人工判断相结合的协议。

Result: GrandJury实现了多元化和可追溯的评估，能够捕捉动态共识并揭示分歧。

Conclusion: GrandJury为缺乏绝对真实值的机器学习输出评估提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm
for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute
ground truth.

Motivation: 传统最小二乘优化在高斯噪声下表现良好，但在非对称结构化噪声下失效，需要更鲁棒的回归方法。

Method: 采用混合神经符号架构：Transformer编码器处理数值序列，压缩神经网络预测符号参数，固定符号方程重建序列。

Result: 在合成可穿戴数据上，中位数回归MSE为6e-6至3.5e-5，比最小二乘和鲁棒回归方法提升10-300倍。

Conclusion: 混合神经符号架构能有效处理非对称结构化噪声，显著优于传统回归方法。

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

Conclusion: CauKer为时间序列基础模型的高效预训练提供了新方法。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

Result: 算法在理论上接近最优遗憾下限，仿真中优于KL-UCB等依赖臂算法。

Conclusion: Clus-UCB有效利用集群结构，未来可进一步研究其局限性。

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

Conclusion: PLoRA显著提升了LoRA微调的效率和性能，适用于多种先进LLM。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity as a fine-tuning approach
for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its low resource requirements and good
performance. While a plethora of work has investigated improving LoRA serving
efficiency by serving multiple LoRAs concurrently, existing methods assume that
a wide range of LoRA adapters are available for serving. In our work, we
conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法高效、鲁棒，适用于噪声感知的逆问题求解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

Method: DFedCAD采用加权聚类剪枝（WCP）压缩模型为代表性质心，并通过结构距离度量和可微分k-means蒸馏模块实现高效知识转移。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上的实验表明，DFedCAD在保持最高精度的同时，通信开销降低了86%以上。

Conclusion: DFedCAD为动态现实场景中的高效去中心化学习提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a
differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end
knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while
reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable
and practical solution for efficient decentralized learning in dynamic,
real-world scenarios.

### [224] [Where and How to Enhance: Discovering Bit-Width Contribution for Mixed Precision Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03002)
*Haidong Kang,Lianbo Ma,Guo Yu,Shangce Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley值的混合精度量化方法（SMPQ），通过直接测量比特宽度对任务性能的贡献，优于传统的梯度下降方法（DMPQ）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合精度量化方法（MPQ）通过梯度下降优化比特宽度分配，但量化参数的大小未必反映其对任务性能的实际贡献。

Method: 提出SMPQ方法，利用Shapley值测量比特宽度操作的直接贡献，并采用蒙特卡洛采样降低计算成本。

Result: 在主流基准测试中，SMPQ表现优于基于梯度的方法。

Conclusion: SMPQ通过更准确的贡献评估，实现了混合精度量化的最优性能。

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Urban In-Context Learning的单阶段框架，通过掩码自编码过程统一预训练和推理，解决了现有两阶段方法的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市画像方法通常采用两阶段范式（预训练+线性探测），但城市数据与语言数据存在本质差异，难以直接应用GPT风格的单阶段模型。

Method: 提出Urban In-Context Learning框架，结合Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer和Urban Representation Alignment Mechanism，实现单阶段预训练与推理的统一。

Conclusion: 通过扩散建模和特征对齐机制，该方法显著提升了城市画像的预测性能，为单阶段模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

Result: 多模态方法显著提高了检测的鲁棒性，能在疾病早期阶段识别阿尔茨海默病，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有望革新阿尔茨海默病的早期检测，为更及时有效的治疗铺平道路。

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially
altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the
proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of
AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments

TL;DR: VRPO框架通过强化价值模型和引入辅助损失与变分信息瓶颈，提升PPO在噪声环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF在现实场景中常受噪声奖励监督影响，导致策略不稳定和泛化能力下降。现有方法多关注奖励去噪，却忽视价值模型的关键作用。

Method: 提出VRPO框架，结合基于熵和困惑度的辅助损失与变分信息瓶颈，增强价值模型的噪声过滤能力。

Result: 在数学推理、科学问答和多轮对话任务中，VRPO在噪声奖励下表现优于PPO和GRPO基线。

Conclusion: 价值模型在RLHF中被低估，VRPO为噪声环境下的策略优化提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界中的挑战和实用性需求促使开发仅允许有限次策略更新的算法。

Method: B-MNL-CB扩展了分布最优设计到多分类设置，RS-MNL在对抗性生成上下文中工作。

Result: B-MNL-CB在随机生成上下文下实现√T遗憾，RS-MNL在对抗性上下文中同样实现√T遗憾。实验表明算法优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在有限策略更新下表现优异，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在文本属性超图（TAHGs）中忽略了文本与超图拓扑的关联，且数据增强引入噪声，无法捕捉长程依赖关系。

Method: HiTeC采用两阶段设计：1）预训练结构感知的文本编码器；2）引入语义感知的数据增强和多尺度对比损失。

Result: 实验证明HiTeC在TAHGs上具有高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: HiTeC通过两阶段设计和语义增强，显著提升了文本属性超图的表示学习效果。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

Motivation: 研究SGDM在动态学习率和批量大小调度下的收敛行为，为深度学习训练提供理论支持和实践指导。

Method: 引入结构更简单的Lyapunov函数，扩展理论框架以涵盖三种动态调度策略，并进行实证验证。

Result: 动态调度的SGDM在收敛速度上显著优于固定超参数基线，其中第三种策略（批量增大+学习率增大）收敛最快。

Conclusion: 研究为现代深度学习中的高效稳定训练提供了统一的理论基础和实用建议。

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法对特征空间的假设过于严格，限制了ID与OOD样本的可分离性。

Method: 采用伪标签诱导子空间表示，结合交叉熵分类损失和子空间距离正则化损失。

Result: 大量实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在更自然的假设下显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与现有方法相当，但显著提升了适应性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分子分析和结构模式发现等领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

Method: RegMean++在RegMean目标中引入层内和跨层依赖关系。

Result: RegMean++在多种场景下优于RegMean，并与先进方法竞争。

Conclusion: RegMean++是一种简单有效的模型合并方法，性能优越。

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to various recent advanced
model merging methods. Our code is available at

decouple components like prefill/decode (PD) or attention/FFN (AF) for
heterogeneous scaling. Existing simulators, architected for co-located, dense
models, are unable to capture the intricate system dynamics of these emerging
paradigms. We present Frontier, a high-fidelity simulator designed from the
ground up for this new landscape. Frontier introduces a unified framework to
model both co-located and disaggregated systems, providing native support for
MoE inference with expert parallelism (EP). It enables the simulation of
complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and advanced pipelining
strategies for latency hiding. To ensure fidelity and usability, Frontier
incorporates refined operator models for improved accuracy. Frontier empowers

Conclusion: 研究支持了GPT-OSS的发布决策，MFT方法可为未来开放权重模型的风险评估提供指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable

Result: MPS-SSM在多个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在长期预测和噪声场景中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: MPS-SSM不仅性能优越，其原则还可扩展为通用正则化框架，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了可解释性机器学习模型和用户可调整预测对算法厌恶的影响，发现可调整性显著减少厌恶，而透明性效果较小且不显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明用户可调整预测能减少对不完美算法决策的厌恶，但未涉及模型解释性。本研究旨在探讨解释性模型是否进一步减少厌恶或取代可调整性。

Method: 通过预注册用户研究（280名参与者），比较可调整预测和可视化决策逻辑的可解释模型对算法厌恶的影响。

Result: 可调整性显著减少算法厌恶，透明性效果较小且不显著；两者影响相对独立。

Conclusion: 可调整性仍是减少算法厌恶的有效方法，透明性效果有限，两者作用独立。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

Motivation: 传统神经网络依赖高维嵌入和数据密集型黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性和物理意义。本文旨在提供一种透明且物理基础的方法，结合数学物理、稀疏逼近理论和符号人工智能。

Method: 利用有理谱逼近将时域信号转换为稀疏的物理意义谱表示，通过核投影函数映射为符号谓词，结合基于规则的推理引擎进行逻辑推断。

Conclusion: 该架构为物理信息化的、具备推理能力的机器学习提供了新方向，展示了在保持透明性和数据效率的同时实现高性能的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AS-Softmax的改进方法，解决了传统softmax在分类任务中目标类得分无法达到1、训练过程可能过拟合的问题，并通过自适应梯度累积策略加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统softmax在分类任务中存在目标类得分无法达到1的问题，导致训练过程持续且可能过拟合，同时浪费资源处理已正确分类的样本。

Method: 提出AS-Softmax，通过合理变换和丢弃低得分类，使模型专注于区分目标类与其强对手，并采用自适应梯度累积策略加速训练。

Result: AS-Softmax在多种分类任务中表现优于传统softmax及其变体，且损失与验证性能显著相关，训练速度提升约1.2倍。

Conclusion: AS-Softmax有效解决了传统softmax的问题，提升了分类性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

Method: 系统分析了数据扩展（如并行采样和数据生成）、网络扩展（如架构增强和代理数量扩展）和训练预算扩展（如分布式训练和大批量训练）的策略。

Result: 综述表明，这些扩展策略可以协同提升DRL在决策任务中的性能，但也面临计算效率的挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应平衡可扩展性与计算效率，并探索扩展在机器人控制、自动驾驶等任务中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Result: 首次为Heun采样器推导Wasserstein收敛界，并改进了Euler采样器的结果。

Conclusion: 控制分数误差对真实反向过程的影响是关键，平滑Wasserstein距离有助于优化初始化误差界。

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for
diffusion-based generative models, covering both stochastic (DDPM-like) and
deterministic (DDIM-like) sampling methods. We introduce a simple framework to
analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors. Notably,
we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

Conclusion: 强调了有限网络深度在分离与鲁棒性权衡中的重要性。

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Conformal Prediction的Machine Unlearning方法，提供统计保证，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MU方法缺乏统计保证且计算成本高，需改进。

Method: 基于Conformal Prediction定义MU，提出ECF和EuCF指标，设计优化方法。

Result: 实验证明方法能有效移除目标数据。

Conclusion: 新方法为MU提供了统计保证和高效实现。

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

TL;DR: HALO是一种新型的自动竞价方法，通过后见机制和B样条函数表示，解决了传统方法在样本效率和约束变化下的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字广告平台的实时竞价系统存在广告商异质性，传统自动竞价方法因样本效率低和约束变化泛化能力差而失效。

Method: HALO引入后见机制，将探索数据重新用于任意约束配置的训练，并使用B样条函数表示实现跨约束空间的连续映射。

Result: 工业数据集评估显示，HALO在多尺度约束下表现优越，减少约束违规并提升GMV。

Conclusion: HALO为复杂广告竞价环境提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

Result: 早期结果显示竞争性性能，并提供高质量的逻辑解释。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了基于人类可理解的时间模式的分类，并提供局部和全局的符号解释。

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的alpha-beta散度仅适用于非负数据，而复数数据在信号处理中广泛存在，因此需要扩展其定义。

Method: 通过重新定义alpha-beta散度，使其适用于复数向量，并验证其在特定超参数下退化为经典距离。

Result: 新定义的散度在超参数为1时退化为欧几里得和马氏距离，其他超参数下则扩展了经典散度。

Conclusion: 该扩展为复数数据提供了灵活的散度框架，适用于多种信号处理场景。

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

Motivation: 探讨超关系知识图谱嵌入（HKGE）模型的优越性是否源于其基础KGE模型或扩展模块，并解决现有HKGE模型在长程依赖和信息整合上的不足。

Method: 将HKG分解为KG格式，评估经典KGE模型性能；提出FormerGNN框架，结合GNN编码器和改进的信息整合方法。

Result: 部分KGE模型表现与HKGE模型相当，但分解方法破坏HKG拓扑；FormerGNN性能优于现有HKGE模型。

Conclusion: 分解方法影响HKG信息完整性，FormerGNN为解决HKGE问题提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

Conclusion: 研究为假设检验框架下的策略互动提供了全面视角，兼具技术和监管意义。

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis
testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

Conclusion: PINO能够实现准确、实时的波场重建，并在多种波况下表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

TL;DR: LieQ是一种基于度量的后训练量化框架，通过层级诊断实现低比特压缩，保持子7B模型的准确性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在低比特压缩下准确率下降的问题，优化资源受限设备的部署。

Method: 引入三种层级诊断指标（困惑度下降、表示紧凑性和Top-k能量增益），自动分配比特宽度，无需梯度更新。

Result: 在2比特量化下，LieQ恢复95.9%的FP16基线性能，优于GPTQ和AWQ，并在LLaMA3.2-3B上实现4倍内存减少。

Conclusion: LieQ为资源受限设备部署小型语言模型提供了新范式，实现了压缩与准确性的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TDS方法提取关键参数（陷阱结合能和密度）存在挑战，需要间接方法。

Method: 开发了一个多神经网络模型，包括分类网络和回归网络，用于预测陷阱类型、密度和结合能。

Result: 模型在三种不同成分的回火马氏体钢中表现出强大的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该模型为氢陷阱参数的直接预测提供了有效工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN
architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to
minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong
predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of
different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

TL;DR: AI on the Pulse是一个实时异常检测系统，结合可穿戴设备和AI模型，用于监测患者健康状况，提供个性化警报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统分类方法在实时场景中需要持续标注的不切实际问题，提供更高效的异常检测方案。

Method: 采用UniTS时间序列模型，融合传感器数据，通过异常检测而非分类实现实时监测。

Result: 在12种先进异常检测方法中表现最佳，F1分数提升约22%，适用于医疗设备和消费级可穿戴设备。

Conclusion: 系统成功应用于家庭环境，证明无需临床级设备即可实现高质量健康监测，并通过LLM增强结果可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层代理框架，用于自动化分子优化，通过多代理协作缩短药物发现周期，结果显示多代理设置显著提升了结合亲和力优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现过程中数据、专业知识和工具的分散导致设计周期缓慢，因此需要一种自动化框架来加速分子优化。

Method: 采用分层代理框架，包括Principal Researcher、Database agent、AI Expert、Medicinal Chemist、Ranking agent和Scientific Critic，通过工具调用和简洁的溯源记录实现协作。

Result: 多代理设置将平均预测结合亲和力提高了31%，而单代理生成的分子具有更优的药物特性但结合力较弱。

Conclusion: 多代理框架通过透明工具信号和溯源记录，将通用LLM转化为可审计的分子设计系统，未来可扩展工具集以进一步优化药物发现流程。

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究多关注单轮问题，而现实任务（如软件工程）需要多轮交互。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用改进的DAPO算法，基于Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct模型训练智能体，解决软件工程任务。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified基准测试中，成功率从20%提升至39%，并在SWE-rebench中优于其他领先模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于开源模型构建更强大的自主智能体提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

TL;DR: SLA-MORL是一个基于多目标强化学习的框架，用于动态分配云环境中的GPU和CPU资源，以平衡训练时间、成本和SLA合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态资源分配或单目标优化方法无法同时满足SLA合规性和资源效率的需求，导致资源浪费或SLA违规。

Method: SLA-MORL通过智能初始化和动态权重调整，利用21维状态表示和9种可能的动作，实现自适应资源分配。

Result: 在13种不同的ML工作负载上，SLA-MORL显著减少了训练时间（67.2%）、成本（68.8%）并提高了SLA合规性（73.4%）。

Conclusion: SLA-MORL通过解决冷启动和动态适应问题，为现代ML训练环境提供了性能、成本和可靠性的平衡解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

TL;DR: MoKA提出了一种新的Kronecker适配器，通过混合Kronecker乘积和门控机制提升表达力，同时保持参数高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩适配器因秩限制表达力不足，难以应对复杂任务。

Method: 采用混合Kronecker乘积建模权重更新，引入门控机制动态调整因子重要性，并优化硬件计算。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B和LLaMA3-8B上，MoKA性能优于基线，参数减少27倍。

Conclusion: MoKA在性能和参数效率间实现了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: VRPRM通过视觉推理和两阶段训练策略，以低成本数据实现高质量推理能力，超越传统PRM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PRM缺乏长期推理和深度思考能力，而CoT-PRM数据标注成本过高。

Method: 提出VRPRM，结合视觉推理，设计两阶段训练策略。

Result: 仅用3.6K CoT-PRM和50K非CoT数据，性能提升118%，超越400K数据的传统PRM。

Conclusion: VRPRM为PRM训练提供高效数据利用新范式。

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

TL;DR: Horus是一个基于低秩适应（LoRA）的联邦学习框架，旨在解决异构性和投毒攻击问题，通过聚合LoRA而非完整模型参数来减少攻击面，并利用LoRA-A的稳定性设计检测和聚合机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在超异构环境下易受投毒攻击，且高维模型增加了攻击面，传统聚合策略效果不佳且难以检测攻击。

Method: Horus在稳定层插入LoRA，仅聚合LoRA以减少攻击面；利用LoRA-A的稳定性设计异构无关的投毒评分和投影感知聚合机制。

Result: 在多种数据集、模型架构和攻击下，Horus在鲁棒性和准确性上均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Horus通过LoRA和异构无关机制有效提升了联邦学习的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有XAI方法因缺乏统一的解释标准而难以客观评估和优化，DeepFaith旨在通过统一的多指标优化提供理论上的最优解释。

Method: DeepFaith通过统一多个广泛使用的可信度指标，设计了一个解释器学习框架，结合现有解释方法生成高质量监督信号，并优化模式一致性和局部相关性。

Result: 在12个任务、6个模型和6个数据集上，DeepFaith在10个指标上的可信度表现优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: DeepFaith提供了一种跨领域通用的高可信度解释框架，解决了XAI领域的关键挑战。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAEs训练中，随机采样潜在变量引入的梯度方差会减缓收敛并降低性能。

Method: 利用特定解码器架构解析计算ELBO的期望值，实现零方差梯度，并通过动态训练策略逐步过渡到标准随机估计器。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了该方法优于现有估计器（如重参数化、Gumbel-Softmax和REINFORCE）。

Conclusion: Silent Gradients为生成模型训练提供了新方向，结合解析计算的稳定性和深度非线性架构的表达能力。

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在预测偏离历史趋势的作物产量时表现不佳，主要由于预训练天气数据与微调数据之间的不对称性。

Method: VITA利用天气变量作为代理目标进行预训练，通过自监督特征掩码学习预测大气状态，仅需基本天气统计数据进行微调。

Result: 在美国玉米带的763个县，VITA在预测玉米和大豆产量上表现最优，尤其在极端天气年份显著优于现有模型（p≈0.01）。

Conclusion: VITA展示了领域感知AI设计如何克服数据限制，支持气候变化下的农业预测，适用于数据稀缺地区。

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a
changing climate.

Motivation: 传统NWP模型计算成本高且复杂，需要改进以实现更高效、准确的太阳能预测。

Method: SolarSeer通过历史卫星数据直接映射未来预测，避免了数据同化和偏微分方程求解。

Result: SolarSeer在CONUS地区的预测误差比HRRR降低了27.28%（再分析数据）和15.35%（1800个站点），且能捕捉辐照度波动。

Conclusion: SolarSeer为可持续能源系统提供了快速、准确的太阳能预测支持。

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the

results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

TL;DR: Goedel-Prover-V2是一系列开源语言模型，在自动定理证明领域达到新SOTA，通过合成数据、自校正和模型平均等创新方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自动定理证明的性能，通过创新方法解决模型训练中的多样性下降和复杂性不足问题。

Method: 采用专家迭代和强化学习流程，结合合成数据生成、验证器引导的自校正和模型平均三种创新技术。

Result: 小型模型Goedel-Prover-V2-8B在MiniF2F上达到84.6% pass@32，旗舰模型Goedel-Prover-V2-32B在标准模式下达88.1%，自校正模式下达90.4%，显著超越之前SOTA。

Conclusion: Goedel-Prover-V2在开源定理证明器中表现最强，计算预算受限下性能优异，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in
standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a
large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on
PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on
the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47
problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute
budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2
achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem
provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source
systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time
compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高斯混合模型样本复杂度的结构特性，挑战传统观点（最小间隔决定复杂度），提出更准确的几何量PCF。

Method: 引入PCF（Pair Correlation Factor）作为新的几何量，并在均匀球形情况下设计算法，改进样本复杂度界限。

Result: PCF比最小间隔更能准确反映参数恢复的难度，算法在特定情况下突破了传统的样本复杂度界限。

Conclusion: PCF是理解GMM样本复杂度的关键因素，未来研究可基于此进一步优化算法。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:
which structural properties govern their sample complexity? Prior work has
largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between
components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete.
  We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity
capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF
more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.
  In the uniform spherical case, we give an algorithm with improved sample
complexity bounds, showing when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are
necessary.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于患者特定权重的预训练模型微调方法，以解决癫痫患者数据分布差异导致的跨患者问题，实验显示分类准确率平均提升10%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫手术需要准确识别发作起始区（SOZ），但依赖专家视觉判断且患者数据分布差异大，导致机器学习模型在新患者数据上表现不稳定。

Method: 先通过监督学习训练模型，然后利用测试患者数据的中间特征定义与训练患者数据的相似性权重，最后基于权重微调预训练模型。

Result: 采用留一患者法评估，结果显示每位测试患者的分类准确率均有提升，平均提升超过10%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过患者特定权重微调，有效解决了跨患者问题，提升了诊断性能。

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

Motivation: 探讨深度学习模型内部表示对架构选择的敏感性，以及跨模型表示结构的稳定性、对齐性和可转移性。

Method: 结合理论分析、实证探测和受控转移实验，开发了一个框架来测量和分析不同架构间的表示对齐。

Result: 结构规律能诱导出在架构变化下更稳定的表示几何，提高跨模型特征的可互操作性。

Conclusion: 结构偏置不仅支持模型内的泛化，还提升了跨模型特征的可转移性，对模型蒸馏和模块化学习有重要意义。

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

TL;DR: Morphology-aware policy learning with PEFT improves sample efficiency and reduces parameters needed for specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sub-optimal zero-shot performance of morphology-aware policies in robotics, avoiding costly end-to-end finetuning.

Method: Combine morphology-aware pretraining with PEFT techniques (tuning subsets, input adapters, prefix tuning) for online finetuning.

Result: PEFT reduces samples needed for policy improvement; tuning <1% of parameters enhances zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: PEFT with pretraining is efficient for specializing policies, reducing computational costs in robotics.

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在固定预算下，如何平衡评估数据中的样本数量（N）和每个样本的标注次数（K），以优化机器学习评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习评估中的人类标注数据常因预算限制而忽略标注者间的分歧，缺乏相关研究。

Method: 通过分析多标注数据集和模拟分布，确定最优的（N, K）配置。

Result: 研究发现，考虑人类分歧时，N×K≤1000即可满足需求，且K>10时效果最佳。不同指标对K的敏感性不同。

Conclusion: 研究为机器学习实践者提供了优化评估数据收集的方法，以在预算内获得更高的可靠性。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成内容缺乏可验证保证的问题，通过合约机制提升其可靠性和可控性。

Method: 引入合约层，结合语义和类型要求，并通过概率修复机制引导生成合规内容。

Result: 实现了对LLM输入输出的语义和类型验证，提出功能等价性概念。

Conclusion: 合约层为LLM提供了可验证的合规性框架，扩展了其作为语义解析器和黑盒组件的双重角色。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自问自答框架（SQLM），通过预训练语言模型生成问题并尝试解答，无需外部数据即可提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型是否能在无外部数据的情况下，仅通过生成问题和解答来提升推理能力。

Method: 提出SQLM框架，采用非对称自博弈方式，通过强化学习训练提问者和解答者。提问者生成问题，解答者尝试解答，双方根据难度和正确性获得奖励。

Result: 在三位数乘法、OMEGA代数问题和Codeforces编程问题三个基准测试中验证了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 语言模型可以通过自生成问题和解答持续提升性能，无需依赖外部数据集。

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

Abstract: We show, contrary to the optimism about LLM's problem-solving abilities,
fueled by the recent gold medals that were attained, that a problem exists --
Yu Tsumura's 554th problem -- that a) is within the scope of an IMO problem in
terms of proof sophistication, b) is not a combinatorics problem which has
caused issues for LLMs, c) requires fewer proof techniques than typical hard

<details>

Motivation: 随着AI系统自主性增强，确保其决策与人类偏好对齐至关重要。传统IRL需要大量人类示范数据，成本高昂，尤其在自动驾驶或机器人等领域，错误可能带来严重后果。

Method: 提出PAC-EIG和Reward-EIG两种信息论获取函数，前者专注于策略的PAC保证，后者专注于奖励函数学习。通过最大化关于学徒策略遗憾的信息增益，高效选择需进一步示范的状态。

Result: 在有限状态-动作空间中证明了收敛性边界，并通过实验展示了该方法优于现有启发式方法。

Conclusion: PAC-EIG为主动IRL提供了首个理论保证，显著减少了对人类示范数据的需求，同时确保策略可靠性。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的行为建模为理解和改善学生心理健康提供了新途径，展示了感知数据与模拟结合的潜力。

Abstract: Students' mental well-being is vital for academic success, with activities
such as studying, socializing, and sleeping playing a role. Current mobile
sensing data highlight this intricate link using statistical and machine
learning analyses. We propose a novel LLM agent-based simulation framework to
model student activities and mental health using the StudentLife Dataset. Each
LLM agent was initialized with personality questionnaires and guided by
smartphone sensing data throughout the simulated semester. These agents predict
individual behaviors, provide self-reported mental health data via ecological
momentary assessments (EMAs), and complete follow-up personality
questionnaires. To ensure accuracy, we investigated various prompting
techniques, memory systems, and activity-based mental state management
strategies that dynamically update an agent's mental state based on their daily
activities. This simulation goes beyond simply replicating existing data. This
allows us to explore new scenarios that are not present in the original
dataset, such as peer influence through agent-to-agent interactions and the
impact of social media. Furthermore, we can conduct intervention studies by
manipulating activity patterns via sensing signals and personality traits using
questionnaire responses. This provides valuable insights into the behavioral
changes that could enhance student well-being. The framework also facilitates
hypothetical interviews with LLM agents, offering deeper insights into their
mental health. This study showcases the power of LLM-driven behavioral modeling
with sensing data, opening new avenues for understanding and supporting student
mental health.

Abstract: Emotional and mental well-being are vital components of quality of life, and
with the rise of smart devices like smartphones, wearables, and artificial
intelligence (AI), new opportunities for monitoring emotions in everyday
settings have emerged. However, for AI algorithms to be effective, they require
high-quality data and accurate annotations. As the focus shifts towards
collecting emotion data in real-world environments to capture more authentic
emotional experiences, the process of gathering emotion annotations has become
increasingly complex. This work explores the challenges of everyday emotion
data collection from the perspectives of key stakeholders. We collected 75
survey responses, performed 32 interviews with the public, and 3 focus group
discussions (FGDs) with 12 mental health professionals. The insights gained
from a total of 119 stakeholders informed the development of our framework,
AnnoSense, designed to support everyday emotion data collection for AI. This
framework was then evaluated by 25 emotion AI experts for its clarity,
usefulness, and adaptability. Lastly, we discuss the potential next steps and
implications of AnnoSense for future research in emotion AI, highlighting its
potential to enhance the collection and analysis of emotion data in real-world
contexts.

Conclusion: 研究为设计更及时且可操作的自适应心理健康干预提供了新见解。

Abstract: The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has enabled real-time
monitoring and intervention for mental health conditions using passively sensed
smartphone data. Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune
moments, adapting to users' evolving contexts and needs. Although prior
research has examined how context affects user responses to generic
notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored
its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions.
Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when
users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to
understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with
and act upon the intervention.
  In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components:
acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to
act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study
with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive
sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions.
The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a
reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating
smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility,
and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize
intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results
show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user
receptivity to interventions. Our findings contribute insights into the design
of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also
actionable in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 直接意图-任务匹配范式及其实现工具NeuroSync有效解决了用户与LLM交互中的模糊性问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited
programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often
face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in
frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause
of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents
and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and
interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we
propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that
externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e.,
the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code
generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in
NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM
understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by
allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We
evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and
assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The
results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort,
and improves coding efficiency.

Result: 研究发现版主需应对三大挑战，现有系统支持不足，且平台政策可能限制吸毒者获取关键资源。

Conclusion: 结论是需改进自动化工具和系统设计，以支持版主工作并促进吸毒者社区的健康发展。

Abstract: Online communities serve as essential support channels for People Who Use
Drugs (PWUD), providing access to peer support and harm reduction information.
The moderation of these communities involves consequential decisions affecting
member safety, yet existing sociotechnical systems provide insufficient support
for moderators. Through interviews with experienced moderators from PWUD forums
on Reddit, we analyse the unique nature of this work. We argue that this work
constitutes a distinct form of public health intervention characterised by
three moderation challenges: the need for specialised, expert risk assessment;
time-critical crisis response; and the navigation of a structural conflict
between platform policies and community safety goals. We demonstrate how
current moderation systems are insufficient in supporting PWUD communities. For
example, policies minimising platforms' legal exposure to illicit activities
can inadvertently push moderators to implement restrictive rules to protect
community's existence, which can limit such a vulnerable group's ability to
share potentially life-saving resources online. We conclude by identifying two
necessary shifts in sociotechnical design to support moderators' work: first,
moving to automated tools that support human sensemaking in contexts with
competing interests; and second, shifting from systems that require moderators
to perform low-level rule programming to those that enable high-level,
example-based instruction. Further, we highlight how the design of
sociotechnical systems in online spaces could impact harm reduction efforts
aimed at improving health outcomes for PWUD communities.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VRSight是一个端到端系统，通过AI模型识别VR场景并生成空间音频反馈，使盲人用户无需开发者干预即可使用VR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR对盲人用户不可访问，现有技术需要额外开发工作，主流VR应用仍缺乏无障碍支持。

Method: VRSight利用AI模型（如目标检测、深度估计、基于LLM的氛围解释）生成空间音频反馈，并贡献了DISCOVR数据集用于虚拟元素检测。

Result: 九名参与者使用VRSight成功探索了Rec Room VR应用，验证了其在社交任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: VRSight为盲人用户提供了无需开发者干预的VR无障碍解决方案，填补了行业空白。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) is inaccessible to blind people. While research has
investigated many techniques to enhance VR accessibility, they require
additional developer effort to integrate. As such, most mainstream VR apps
remain inaccessible as the industry de-prioritizes accessibility. We present
VRSight, an end-to-end system that recognizes VR scenes post hoc through a set
of AI models (e.g., object detection, depth estimation, LLM-based atmosphere
interpretation) and generates tone-based, spatial audio feedback, empowering
blind users to interact in VR without developer intervention. To enable virtual
element detection, we further contribute DISCOVR, a VR dataset consisting of 30
virtual object classes from 17 social VR apps, substituting real-world datasets
that remain not applicable to VR contexts. Nine participants used VRSight to
explore an off-the-shelf VR app (Rec Room), demonstrating its effectiveness in
facilitating social tasks like avatar awareness and available seat
identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理中的卓越能力与XR的融合，有望革新用户与沉浸式环境的交互方式。

Method: 通过技术范式分类（如交互代理控制、XR开发工具包、生成场景合成）和应用领域分析（如教育、医疗、工业），系统梳理了LLM与XR的结合。

Result: 总结了当前趋势、设计考虑和开放挑战，为智能XR体验的研究与实践提供了指导。

Conclusion: LLM增强的XR系统具有广阔前景，但仍需解决技术挑战以推动其进一步发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, and their integration with
Extended Reality (XR) is poised to transform how users interact with immersive
environments. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent
developments at the intersection of LLMs and XR, offering a structured
organization of research along both technical and application dimensions. We
propose a taxonomy of LLM-enhanced XR systems centered on key technical
paradigms -- such as interactive agent control, XR development toolkits, and
generative scene synthesis -- and discuss how these paradigms enable novel
capabilities in XR. In parallel, we examine how LLM-driven techniques support
practical XR applications across diverse domains, including immersive
education, clinical healthcare, and industrial manufacturing. By connecting
these technical paradigms with application frontiers, our survey highlights
current trends, delineates design considerations, and identifies open
challenges in building LLM-augmented XR systems. This work provides insights
that can guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of the art
in intelligent XR experiences.

*Shuchang Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI赋能的交互式叙事为盲人和低视力用户提供了一种在连贯故事中探索视觉媒体的新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具将探索与叙事分离，增加了认知负担并限制了用户对视觉媒体的深度参与。

Method: 提出了三种技术：分层叙事（支持不同细节级别的照片集探索）、平行叙事（提供时间同步的视频评论）和分支叙事（支持360度视频的沉浸式导航）。

Result: 这些技术证明AI赋能的交互式叙事能在多样媒体格式中平衡用户自主性和叙事连贯性。

Conclusion: 未来工作将进一步提升个性化和表达性叙事体验。

Abstract: Empowering blind and low vision (BLV) users to explore visual media improves
content comprehension, strengthens user agency, and fulfills diverse
information needs. However, most existing tools separate exploration from the
main narration, which disrupts the narrative flow, increases cognitive load,
and limits deep engagement with visual media. To address these challenges, my
PhD research introduces the paradigm of AI-powered interactive storytelling,
which leverages AI to generate interactive narratives, enabling BLV users to
explore visual media within a coherent storytelling experience. I have
operationalized this paradigm through three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Narrative, which supports photo-collection exploration at different levels of
detail; (2) Parallel Narrative, which provides seamless access to time-synced
video comments; and (3) Branching Narrative, which enables immersive navigation
of 360{\deg} videos. Together, these techniques demonstrate that AI-powered
interactive storytelling can effectively balance user agency with narrative
coherence across diverse media formats. My future work will advance this
paradigm by enabling more personalized and expressive storytelling experiences
for BLV audiences.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出StoryEnsemble工具，通过AI支持设计过程中的动态探索与迭代，解决了时间和资源限制对设计流程的阻碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计过程中时间和资源限制常阻碍设计师广泛探索和迭代，难以实践核心设计原则。

Method: 通过15名参与者的形成性研究，开发了StoryEnsemble工具，整合AI和节点链接界面，支持多向迭代。

Result: 10名参与者的用户研究表明，StoryEnsemble能实现快速、多向迭代和灵活导航。

Conclusion: StoryEnsemble通过新颖交互方式，使设计探索和迭代更流畅、易用且有趣，推动了AI在迭代设计中的应用。

Abstract: Design processes involve exploration, iteration, and movement across
interconnected stages such as persona creation, problem framing, solution
ideation, and prototyping. However, time and resource constraints often hinder
designers from exploring broadly, collecting feedback, and revisiting earlier
assumptions-making it difficult to uphold core design principles in practice.
To better understand these challenges, we conducted a formative study with 15
participants-comprised of UX practitioners, students, and instructors. Based on
the findings, we developed StoryEnsemble, a tool that integrates AI into a
node-link interface and leverages forward and backward propagation to support
dynamic exploration and iteration across the design process. A user study with
10 participants showed that StoryEnsemble enables rapid, multi-directional
iteration and flexible navigation across design stages. This work advances our
understanding of how AI can foster more iterative design practices by
introducing novel interactions that make exploration and iteration more fluid,
accessible, and engaging.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Navigation Pixie的动态导航代理，用于商业元宇宙平台，通过结合空间元数据和LLM的自然语言处理，显著提升了用户的探索体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业元宇宙平台缺乏动态适应用户兴趣和意图的导航辅助，现有研究在商业环境中的实现存在挑战。

Method: 采用松散耦合架构，结合结构化空间元数据和基于LLM的自然语言处理，减少平台依赖性。

Result: 实验显示，Navigation Pixie显著增加了用户在PC和VR-HMD平台上的停留时间和自由探索。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了VR交互设计，建立了跨平台评估方法，并展示了商业元宇宙平台的实证实验框架。

Abstract: While commercial metaverse platforms offer diverse user-generated content,
they lack effective navigation assistance that can dynamically adapt to users'
interests and intentions. Although previous research has investigated on-demand
agents in controlled environments, implementation in commercial settings with
diverse world configurations and platform constraints remains challenging.
  We present Navigation Pixie, an on-demand navigation agent employing a
loosely coupled architecture that integrates structured spatial metadata with
LLM-based natural language processing while minimizing platform dependencies,
which enables experiments on the extensive user base of commercial metaverse
platforms. Our cross-platform experiments on commercial metaverse platform
Cluster with 99 PC client and 94 VR-HMD participants demonstrated that
Navigation Pixie significantly increased dwell time and free exploration
compared to fixed-route and no-agent conditions across both platforms.
Subjective evaluations revealed consistent on-demand preferences in PC
environments versus context-dependent social perception advantages in VR-HMD.
This research contributes to advancing VR interaction design through
conversational spatial navigation agents, establishes cross-platform evaluation
methodologies revealing environment-dependent effectiveness, and demonstrates
empirical experimentation frameworks for commercial metaverse platforms.

Motivation: 研究混合交通环境中自动化车辆、手动操作车辆和弱势道路用户的交互问题，填补单主体研究的不足。

Method: 通过参与式研讨会（N=15）和问卷调查（N=19）探索多主体汽车研究的现状。

Result: 发现多主体方法的价值被广泛认可，但实际和技术障碍限制了其应用。

Conclusion: 需要跨学科方法、更好的工具和仿真环境来支持可扩展、现实且符合伦理的多主体研究。

Abstract: The transition to mixed-traffic environments that involve automated vehicles,
manually operated vehicles, and vulnerable road users presents new challenges
for human-centered automotive research. Despite this, most studies in the
domain focus on single-agent interactions. This paper reports on a
participatory workshop (N = 15) and a questionnaire (N = 19) conducted during
the AutomotiveUI '24 conference to explore the state of multi-agent automotive
research. The participants discussed methodological challenges and
opportunities in real-world settings, simulations, and computational modeling.
Key findings reveal that while the value of multi-agent approaches is widely
recognized, practical and technical barriers hinder their implementation. The
study highlights the need for interdisciplinary methods, better tools, and
simulation environments that support scalable, realistic, and ethically
informed multi-agent research.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了联合人类-AI推理在机器人任务中的潜力，发现基于置信度的选择能提高准确性，但AI校准不良会损害性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助任务中，人类与AI的互补性难以实现，因人类判断何时接受AI建议存在缺陷。

Method: 通过用户研究（N=100），模拟机器人远程操作任务，研究基于置信度的联合推理。

Result: 联合推理准确性更高，但AI校准不良会降低性能；人类会根据AI建议调整推理。

Conclusion: 需要具备良好元认知敏感性的AI决策支持系统，以实现有效的人机协作。

Abstract: Joint human-AI inference holds immense potential to improve outcomes in
human-supervised robot missions. Current day missions are generally in the
AI-assisted setting, where the human operator makes the final inference based
on the AI recommendation. However, due to failures in human judgement on when
to accept or reject the AI recommendation, complementarity is rarely achieved.
We investigate joint human-AI inference where the inference made with higher
confidence is selected. Through a user study with N=100 participants on a
representative simulated robot teleoperation task, specifically studying the
inference of robots' control delays we show that: a) Joint inference accuracy
is higher and its extent is regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI
agent, and b) Humans change their inferences based on AI recommendations and
the extent and direction of this change is also regulated by the confidence
calibration of the AI agent. Interestingly, our results show that pairing
poorly-calibrated AI-DSS with humans hurts performance instead of helping the
team, reiterating the need for AI-based decision support systems with good
metacognitive sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the
first application of a maximum-confidence-based heuristic for joint human-AI
inference within a simulated robot teleoperation task.

*Zhuoqun Jiang,ShunYi Yeo,Wei Xuan Donovan Seow,Simon Perrault*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Remini是一款聊天机器人，旨在通过互动对话支持伴侣间的共同回忆，显著提升情感联系和参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术工具多关注个体回忆或单向叙事，忽视了互动对话对共同回忆的重要性。

Method: 基于SFAM框架，Remini通过五个叙事阶段（建立关系、记忆叙述、扩展、反思和总结）引导情感丰富的对话。

Result: 研究发现，Remini显著提升了积极情绪、连接感和参与度，并促进了更详细的叙事共建和更多自我披露。

Conclusion: Remini为通过共同回忆增强人际联系的对话代理提供了实证支持的设计启示。

Abstract: Mutual reminiscence, defined as revisiting shared positive memories through
reciprocal self-disclosure, strengthens emotional bonds, enhances well-being,
and deepens intimacy. However, most technology-mediated reminiscence tools
emphasize individual reflection or one-way storytelling, which overlooks the
dynamic, interactive dialogue essential for meaningful mutual reminiscence. To
address this limitation, we introduce Remini, a chatbot designed to support
reciprocal self-disclosure between close partners such as couples, friends, or
family members. Grounded in the Social Functions of Autobiographical Memory
(SFAM) framework, Remini uses conversational AI to guide emotionally rich
exchanges through five narrative phases: rapport building, memory narration,
elaboration, reflection, and summary. In a mixed-method, both between- and
within- subjects study (N = 48, 24 dyads), we compare Remini to a baseline
chatbot that offers minimal memory-trigger prompts. Our findings show that
structured guidance from Remini significantly improves positive affect, feeling
of connection, and engagement. It also fosters more detailed narrative
co-construction and greater reciprocal self-disclosure. Participant feedback
highlights the practical value, perceived benefits, and design considerations
of chatbot-mediated reminiscence. We contribute empirically grounded design
implications for conversational agents that strengthen human connection through
mutual reminiscence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定性方法难以准确预测未来技术的影响，希望通过实验方法提供更可靠的定量数据。

Method: 采用实验方法模拟未来技术，通过控制变量收集参与者的态度和行为数据。

Result: 该方法尚未被广泛接受，主要因实验科学家对其有效性存疑。

Conclusion: 需通过约束研究范围和采用沉浸式方法提升有效性，并推动该方法的主流化。

Abstract: Predicting the social and behavioral impact of future technologies, before
they are achieved, would allow us to guide their development and regulation
before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied
on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method which uses
experimental methods to simulate future technologies, and collect quantitative
measures of the attitudes and behaviors of participants assigned to controlled
variations of the future. We call this method 'science fiction science'. We
suggest that the reason why this method has not been fully embraced yet,
despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be
reluctant to engage in work facing such serious validity threats as science
fiction science. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on
the kind of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the
unconventional, immersive methods that science fiction science may require. We
seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been
marginalized for so long, what benefits it would bring if it could be built on
strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the
diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle
of validity improvement.

TL;DR: Guided Reality是一个基于LLM和视觉模型的自动化AR系统，通过生成动态视觉指导提升用户对物理任务的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的AR指导缺乏丰富的视觉增强，难以将指令有效嵌入空间环境。

Method: 系统结合LLM和视觉模型，生成多步骤指令、识别视觉指导类型、提取空间信息并嵌入视觉指导。

Result: 通过用户研究（N=16）和专家反馈验证了系统的实用性和集成潜力。

Conclusion: Guided Reality为AR指导提供了更有效的视觉嵌入方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic generation of
step-by-step augmented reality (AR) instructions for a wide range of physical
tasks. However, existing LLM-based AR guidance often lacks rich visual
augmentations to effectively embed instructions into spatial context for a
better user understanding. We present Guided Reality, a fully automated AR
system that generates embedded and dynamic visual guidance based on
step-by-step instructions. Our system integrates LLMs and vision models to: 1)
generate multi-step instructions from user queries, 2) identify appropriate
types of visual guidance, 3) extract spatial information about key interaction
points in the real world, and 4) embed visual guidance in physical space to
support task execution. Drawing from a corpus of user manuals, we define five
categories of visual guidance and propose an identification strategy based on
the current step. We evaluate the system through a user study (N=16),
completing real-world tasks and exploring the system in the wild. Additionally,
four instructors shared insights on how Guided Reality could be integrated into
their training workflows.

Motivation: 自动化评估特定图形设计（如幻灯片）是一个未解决的问题，SlideAudit旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 与设计专家合作开发幻灯片设计缺陷分类法，收集并标注2400张幻灯片，测试多种大型语言模型和提示策略。

Result: AI模型识别设计缺陷的F1分数在0.331到0.655之间，利用分类法的提示策略表现最佳。修复研究中，82.0%的幻灯片显著改善。

Conclusion: SlideAudit展示了自动化幻灯片评估的潜力，但AI仍需改进，分类法对提升效果显著。

Abstract: Automated evaluation of specific graphic designs like presentation slides is
an open problem. We present SlideAudit, a dataset for automated slide
evaluation. We collaborated with design experts to develop a thorough taxonomy
of slide design flaws. Our dataset comprises 2400 slides collected and
synthesized from multiple sources, including a subset intentionally modified
with specific design problems. We then fully annotated them using our taxonomy
through strictly trained crowdsourcing from Prolific. To evaluate whether AI is
capable of identifying design flaws, we compared multiple large language models
under different prompting strategies, and with an existing design critique
pipeline. We show that AI models struggle to accurately identify slide design
flaws, with F1 scores ranging from 0.331 to 0.655. Notably, prompting
techniques leveraging our taxonomy achieved the highest performance. We further
conducted a remediation study to assess AI's potential for improving slides.
Among 82.0% of slides that showed significant improvement, 87.8% of them were
improved more with our taxonomy, further demonstrating its utility.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了先进的多模态模型如何帮助盲人或视障人士（BVI）通过实时视频AI（如ChatGPT的Advanced Voice with Video）完成现实任务，发现其在静态场景中有效，但在动态场景中存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索实时视频AI对BVI人士的潜在益处和挑战，以支持多样化的辅助任务。

Method: 对8名BVI参与者进行探索性研究，测试他们在不同现实场景中使用实时视频AI的表现。

Result: 当前AI在静态场景中表现良好，但在动态场景中提供实时描述的能力不足；存在信息不准确、幻觉和依赖性问题。

Conclusion: 需改进AI的实时感知能力、干预时机和安全性，以更好地服务BVI用户。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have provided blind or
visually impaired (BVI) individuals with new capabilities to interpret and
engage with the real world through interactive systems that utilize live video
feeds. However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to
support diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we
present findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants.
Participants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live
video AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating
objects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor
environments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively
provides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in
delivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite
inaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the
provided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although
the system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions,
assumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses,
and a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential
risks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for
assistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing
capabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing
beyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI如何重塑用户作为知识贡献者的角色，填补HCI研究中对此的忽视。

Method: 基于31名跨学科学者的访谈，开发了五部分编码手册，识别了五种关系类型。

Result: 发现五种动态关系类型，表明信任、评估模式和任务影响人类与AI的认知合作。

Conclusion: 主张采用更细致的框架理解人机知识共建，丰富HCI对AI使用的认知。

Abstract: As AI systems become integral to knowledge-intensive work, questions arise
not only about their functionality but also their epistemic roles in human-AI
interaction. While HCI research has proposed various AI role typologies, it
often overlooks how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors. This
study examines how users form epistemic relationships with AI-how they assess,
trust, and collaborate with it in research and teaching contexts. Based on 31
interviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook
and identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent
Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic
Abstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and
human epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and
context-dependent. We argue for shifting beyond static metaphors of AI toward a
more nuanced framework that captures how humans and AI co-construct knowledge,
enriching HCI's understanding of the relational and normative dimensions of AI
use.

TL;DR: VCNet是一种受灵长类视觉皮层启发的神经网络架构，通过模拟生物机制（如分层处理和双流信息分离）提升图像分类效率与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代CNN存在数据效率低、泛化能力差和对抗性攻击脆弱等问题，而灵长类视觉系统表现出更高的效率和鲁棒性，因此探索其架构原理以改进人工视觉系统。

Method: VCNet模拟灵长类视觉皮层的宏观组织，包括分层处理、双流信息分离和自上而下的预测反馈。

Result: 在Spots-10和光场图像分类任务中，VCNet分别达到92.1%和74.4%的准确率，优于同类模型。

Conclusion: 结合神经科学原理设计网络可提升模型效率和鲁棒性，为解决机器学习中的长期挑战提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency,
poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior
efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may
offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper
introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture
whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual
cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical
processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation,
and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized
benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image
classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification
accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset,
surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that
integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more
efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing
long-standing challenges in machine learning.
