Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AMMKD框架，通过多模态特征融合、多教师知识蒸馏和自适应优化，实现轻量高效的图像-文本检索模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言预训练模型在移动设备部署受限，需要解决模型尺寸大和计算复杂度高的问题

Method: 多模态特征融合网络提取图像和文本特征，多教师知识蒸馏框架预训练两个CLIP教师模型，使用KL散度进行概率分布匹配，自适应动态权重方案处理多目标优化

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，AMMKD在显著降低模型复杂度的同时实现了优越性能

Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效解决了移动设备部署问题，验证了其有效性和灵活性

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输入模态（如Apex Frame、光流和动态图像）难以充分捕捉微表情的细微短暂特性，导致识别性能不佳，需要更有效的输入表示和特征提取方法。

Method: 提出MESTI（微表情时空图像）将视频序列转换为单张图像，同时保留微运动特征；设计MEGANet网络，引入梯度注意力模块增强细粒度运动特征提取。

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上达到最高准确率，MESTI在多种CNN架构上均优于现有输入模态，替换现有网络的输入能一致提升性能。

Conclusion: MESTI作为优越的输入模态和MEGANet作为先进的识别网络，为更有效的微表情识别系统奠定了基础，在各种应用中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

### [6] [Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062)
*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaffold Diffusion是一种用于生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构的生成模型，使用离散扩散语言模型处理体素作为token，在98%稀疏度的数据上仍能生成真实连贯的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构面临立方内存扩展和显著类别不平衡的挑战，需要新的生成方法。

Method: 将体素视为token，使用离散扩散语言模型生成3D体素结构，扩展了离散扩散模型在空间连贯3D结构生成中的应用。

Result: 在Minecraft房屋结构数据集上评估显示，相比先前基线和自回归方法，Scaffold Diffusion能生成更真实连贯的结构，即使在超过98%稀疏度的数据上训练。

Conclusion: 离散扩散为3D稀疏体素生成建模提供了一个有前景的框架，能够有效处理高度稀疏的3D结构生成问题。

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了SGLC框架，通过结合全局场景理解和局部细节增强，有效解决高分辨率图像去霜问题，在PSNR指标上获得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前去霜模型在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，常需下采样或切片处理导致性能下降，缺乏有效结合全局与局部信息的方法。

Method: 提出SGLC框架，包含全局特征生成器(GFG)和局部特征增强器(LFE)两部分。GFG重点全局场景理解生成初始去霜结果，LFE精炼局部细节和像素级特征。与Uformer模型集成进行验证。

Result: 在高分辨率数据集上，SGLC在PSNR指标上获得显著提升，显示出在大规模图像去霜方面的强大能力。

Conclusion: SGLC框架能够有效结合全局场景信息和局部细节，为高分辨率图像去霜提供了健壮的解决方案，且具有模型无关性，可以插入任何现有去霜网络。

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了首个大规模自监督异常检测模型用于肾脏毒理病理学，通过UNI基础模型特征提取和自监督方法，在158种化合物的药物安全性评估研究中实现了优于随机水平的异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾脏异常检测是临床前药物开发的关键环节，但传统方法需要人工检查数百到数千张全切片图像，耗时耗力且成本高昂，大多数图像都是正常的。需要开发自动化方法来提高效率。

Method: 使用UNI基础模型提取特征，发现简单的k近邻分类器效果不佳。然后采用自监督方法处理相同特征，实现了更好的异常检测性能。

Result: 自监督方法在接收器操作特征曲线下面积达到0.62，阴性预测值达到89%，优于随机水平。证明该方法可以有效识别正常切片。

Conclusion: 这种模型经过进一步开发后，可用于在药物安全性评估研究中排除正常切片，从而显著降低药物开发的时间和成本。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

*Faizan Farooq Khan,Vladan Stojnić,Zakaria Laskar,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段文本到图像检索方法，首先生成文本查询的视觉表示，然后通过视觉模型计算图像相似度，显著提升语义类别检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在文本和图像表示空间存在模态差距，限制了文本到图像检索的性能，需要弥合这种差距

Method: 两阶段方法：1）使用扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询；2）用视觉模型估计图像间相似度。还引入聚合网络融合多生成图像和跨模态相似度分数

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法 consistently 优于仅依赖文本查询的检索方法

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉编码器、VLM和文本到图像生成模型的最新进展，成功弥合了模态差距，提升了语义类别检索性能

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM评测基准和Safe-LLaVA数据集用于评估和减少多模态大语言模型中的生物识别信息泄漏问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型往往在未请求的情况下推理和泄露敏感的生物识别属性，如种族、性别、年龄等，引发严重隐私担忧

Method: 创建PRISM评测基准，用于评估MLLMs在两个方面的表现：拒绝生物识别相关查询和一般回复中的隐含性泄漏；对LLaVA数据集进行详细审计，并创建了系统移除显式和隐式生物识别信息的Safe-LLaVA数据集

Result: 在PRISM上的评估显示了各种MLLMs在不同属性上的生物识别泄漏问题；使用Safe-LLaVA数据集微调模型后显著减少了泄漏风险

Conclusion: PRISM评测基准和Safe-LLaVA数据集为MLLMs的隐私对齐开发和评估设定了新标准，有助于减少多模态AI系统中的生物识别信息泄漏风险

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at
https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEME是一个跨模态对齐方法，通过构建自我中心的世界模型来增强视觉语言模型在动态环境中的时空推理能力，在导航和问答任务上实现了1%-3%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在静态场景理解表现出色，但在动态开放环境中的时空推理和适应性方面存在局限，缺乏对细粒度时空线索和物理世界理解的建模。

Method: 提出VEME框架，包含三个核心组件：跨模态对齐框架连接对象和空间表示；动态隐式认知地图实现任务相关记忆召回；基于指令的导航推理框架利用具身先验进行长期规划。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入几何感知的时空经验，该方法显著提升了动态环境中的推理和规划能力，为具身智能在未知环境中的复杂任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶状肿瘤在影像学上与良性纤维腺瘤相似，术前分类困难，常导致不必要的手术切除，需要开发更准确的诊断方法

Method: 开发双分支神经网络，从81例确诊患者的超声图像和临床数据中提取并融合特征，采用类别感知采样和分层交叉验证防止数据偏差

Conclusion: 多模态AI有潜力作为非侵入性诊断工具，减少不必要活检，改善乳腺肿瘤管理的临床决策

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

### [15] [A High-Accuracy Fast Hough Transform with Linear-Log-Cubed Computational Complexity for Arbitrary-Shaped Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00231)
*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FHT2SP算法，在保持常数有界误差的同时实现接近最优的计算复杂度，解决了传统快速霍夫变换算法在精度和效率之间的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有快速霍夫变换算法要么计算复杂度最优但精度随尺度恶化，要么精度高但计算成本接近立方级，需要找到精度和效率的平衡点

Method: 基于Brady超像素概念，将其扩展到任意形状（超越原始幂次方约束），并集成到FHT2DT算法中，通过超像素尺寸的选择控制精度

Result: FHT2SP算法实现接近最优的计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，同时保持与图像尺寸无关的常数有界近似误差，可通过元参数控制

Conclusion: FHT2SP算法成功解决了霍夫变换中精度与计算效率的权衡问题，为图像分析等领域提供了既快速又高精度的解决方案

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种语言导向的生成式视觉系统，用于制造业中的残余轮廓检测，通过GAN和视觉-语言模型实现了CAD级精度的轮廓检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统遇到噪声、材料变异性和非控制成像条件的挑战，传统边缘检测器和手工管道效果有限。

Method: 系统分为三步：数据获取和预处理、使用条件GAN生成轮廓、通过视觉-语言模型进行多模态轮廓精细化，采用人在循环的标准化提示词。

Result: 在FabTrack数据集上，系统提高了轮廓保真度，增强了边缘连续性和几何对齐，减少了手工追踪。GPT-image-1在结构准确性和感知质量方面都超过了Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明了VLM导向的生成式工作流在推进工业计算机视觉超越传统管道限制方面的潜力。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息理论的transductive few-shot CLIP方法LIMO，通过语言感知信息最大化损失和参数高效微调策略，在少样本学习任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前transductive few-shot learning主要集中在视觉模型，而在基础视觉-语言模型(VLMs)领域的研究仍处于起步阶段。现有方法较少，需要专门针对VLMs的transductive方法。

Method: 提出了LIMO损失函数，包含三个互补项：(1)视觉输入与文本类别描述间的互信息；(2)KL散度惩罚网络输出与零样本预测的偏差；(3)基于标注样本的标准交叉熵损失。同时探索了参数高效微调(PEFT)策略。

Result: LIMO大幅超越了近期transductive few-shot CLIP方法，相比最佳inductive方法也有显著提升。参数高效微调策略带来了性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了信息理论概念和参数高效微调在transductive few-shot VLMs中的有效性，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphGen是一种通过显式建模核形态和空间组织来提高组织病理学图像域泛化能力的方法，使用监督对比学习框架整合图像、增强和核分割掩码，优先关注诊断特征而非染色伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学中的域泛化受到全切片图像异质性的阻碍，而病理学家依赖跨域不变的形态学线索进行诊断。受此启发，研究假设显式建模生物学上稳健的核形态和空间组织能够学习对域偏移具有弹性的癌症表示。

Method: 提出MorphGen方法，在监督对比学习框架中整合组织病理学图像、增强和核分割掩码，通过对齐图像和核掩码的潜在表示来优先关注诊断特征。还结合随机权重平均(SWA)来增强分布外鲁棒性。

Result: 注意力图分析显示MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类。学习到的表示对图像损坏和对抗攻击具有弹性，展示了出色的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: MorphGen不仅解决了数字病理学中当前深度学习系统的关键脆弱性，还通过生物学启发的形态学建模实现了强大的域泛化性能，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对大型多模态模型的视觉token剪枝策略，通过互信息保持跨模态对齐和最大化嵌入空间距离保持模态内多样性，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算量和提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在处理视觉输入时会产生大量token，导致计算和内存成本显著增加。现有的token剪枝方法存在校准成本高或重要性度量不优的问题，导致保留冗余token。

Method: 提出专门针对视觉token的剪枝策略：1）基于互信息剪除与文本token语义不对齐的视觉token；2）通过最大化嵌入空间中的期望成对距离来剪除冗余视觉token，使用贪心算法高效求解。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B等模型上实现了88.9%的token减少，推理速度提升56.7%，同时保持了强大的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态模型中视觉token冗余问题，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了模型性能，为高效多模态推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Conclusion: 实验验证了该融合方法的优越性、可靠性和稳定性，代码已开源

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单域渗透方法忽视了一个可用资源：目标部署环境的文本描述。这些文本描述实践中容易获得但经常被忽视，能够在严重数据限制下显著提升模型的渗透性能。

Method: 提出STAR方法：1) 使用目标域文本插值构建目标锚定子空间；2) 利用谱投影保留与目标线索对齐的方向，废弃源域特定噪音；3) 通过视觉-语言蓄粉对齐背胎特征与VLM语义几何；4) 使用特征空间Mixup确保源域和目标表征之间的平滑迁移。

Result: 在多个图像分类和物体检测测试集上验证了STAR方法的优势性，显示出该方法在单域渗透问题上的超越性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了最小化的文本元数据能够在严重数据限制下显著提升模型渗透性，为在未见数据的目标环境中部署稳健模型开启了新方向。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

it suitable for deployment on edge devices. AQFusionNet provides a scalable and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像(HSI)去噪是重要预处理步骤，但如何有效利用HSI的低维子空间物理特性（低秩和稀疏表示）同时保持图像细节是一个挑战。

Method: 在U-Net架构中嵌入秩最小化模块(RMM)，将特征图转换到小波域并对低频分量应用奇异值阈值(SVT)，自适应学习参数，并采用迭代细化过程结合中间去噪结果和噪声输入。

Result: 实验结果表明ILRNet在合成和真实噪声去除任务中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ILRNet成功整合了模型驱动和数据驱动方法的优势，通过小波域低秩约束和自适应迭代优化，有效实现了HSI去噪并保持了图像细节。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

Motivation: 现有方法错误地假设遗漏和捏造幻觉有共同成因，往往减少遗漏却引发更多捏造。本文发现这两种幻觉具有不同的根本原因

Method: 提出视觉-语义注意力势场框架，揭示模型如何构建视觉证据来推断物体存在与否。基于此开发VPFC方法，通过校准视觉势场来缓解幻觉

Result: VPFC方法能有效减少遗漏幻觉，同时不会引入额外的捏造幻觉

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前物体幻觉研究的关键疏忽，为开发更稳健和平衡的幻觉缓解策略指明了新方向

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个针对视觉语言模型的两阶段防御框架，通过激活干预和策略优化来增强模型对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持视觉理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示来提取有害方向，性能不佳且会降低视觉定位能力，需要更有效的防御方案

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段计算自适应层特定引导向量来抑制有害行为；第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化（结合毒性评估和视觉一致性奖励）来精炼引导向量

Result: 实验表明SPO-VLM能有效增强对抗攻击的安全性，同时在良性任务上保持强性能且不损害视觉理解能力

Conclusion: SPO-VLM通过结合激活级干预和策略级优化，为VLM提供了高效且有效的防御方案，平衡了效率与效果

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于3D点云数据稀缺，预训练大型3D模型面临挑战。现有方法通过"高到低"映射将视觉模型应用于3D领域，但导致空间几何信息丢失且缺乏通用框架。

Method: 提出APPT方法：1)将原始点云转换为点嵌入，聚合局部几何特征；2)使用排列不变性特征捕捉相对位置；3)介绍与点嵌入模块共享权重的提示生成器，动态生成点提示。

Result: 该方法能够以少量参数微调预训练模型，无需异构映射直接处理点云数据，提供丰富的全局结构信息并补偿异构数据的结构上下文缺失。

Conclusion: APPT方法为多模态基础模型适配到3D点云分析提供了一种通用且参数效率的解决方案，免除了传统异构映射方法的缺陷。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

TL;DR: 提出NoiseCutMix方法，将CutMix概念引入扩散模型生成过程，通过部分组合两个不同类别的估计噪声来生成自然、高分辨率的融合图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CutMix等方法在组合多类别图像时会产生不自然的边界，需要利用扩散模型生成高质量图像的能力来创建更自然的融合数据增强

Method: 在扩散模型中部分组合两个不同类别对应的估计噪声，生成具有两个类别融合特征的自然高分辨率图像

Result: 在分类实验中验证了该方法相比传统多类别组合数据增强技术和随机图像生成方法的有效性

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix方法能够有效生成自然的多类别融合图像，提升数据增强效果

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaMind是一个从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的新框架，通过联合建模神经动力学和语义特征，在视频重建精度和视觉保真度方面实现了显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的挑战，包括EEG空间分辨率低、神经记录与视频动态之间的时间不匹配，以及脑活动中语义信息利用不足的问题

Method: 提出DynaMind框架，包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器(RSM)提取多模态语义特征，时间感知动态对齐器(TDA)生成动态潜在序列确保时间一致性，双引导视频重建器(DGVR)将时间感知蓝图转换为高保真视频

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上达到新的SOTA水平，视频和帧级重建精度分别提升12.5和10.3个百分点，SSIM提升9.4%，FVMD降低19.7%，显示出卓越的视觉保真度和时间一致性

Conclusion: 这项研究在神经动力学与高保真视觉语义之间架起了桥梁，标志着脑解码领域的关键进展

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

TL;DR: 提出两种跨模态知识蒸馏方法UDAKD和FSKD，利用自动驾驶场景中相机和LiDAR的时空同步数据，通过2D预训练模型向3D网络传递知识，无需3D标注即可实现3D LiDAR点云的语义分割。

Motivation: 传统3D LiDAR点云语义分割需要大量标注数据，成本高昂且耗时。相比之下，2D图像数据集资源丰富且规模庞大，希望通过跨模态知识蒸馏利用2D图像信息来减轻3D标注负担。

Method: 提出两种跨模态知识蒸馏方法：无监督域适应知识蒸馏(UDAKD)和基于特征与语义的知识蒸馏(FSKD)。利用相机和LiDAR的时空同步数据，通过已知的2D-3D对应关系，将2D网络输出与3D网络对应点对齐。使用自校准卷积作为域适应模块基础，保留模态通用信息同时过滤模态特定细节。

Result: 通过严格实验验证，所提方法在性能上持续超越该领域最先进的先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D LiDAR点云语义分割的标注难题，通过跨模态知识蒸馏成功利用丰富的2D图像信息，在无需3D标注的情况下实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视频中频繁且突然的视角变化导致物体外观显著变化和部分遮挡，使得现有方法难以实现准确定位。

Method: 提出HERO-VQL方法，包含：1）自上而下的注意力引导（TAG），利用类别token提供高层上下文和主成分得分图进行细粒度定位；2）自我中心增强一致性训练（EgoACT），通过替换查询对象和重排视频帧来增强查询多样性并模拟极端视角变化。

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的大量实验验证了HERO-VQL能有效处理自我中心挑战，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL受人类认知过程启发，通过创新的注意力机制和数据增强策略，在自我中心视觉查询定位任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双约束扩散模型(DCDM)用于超低剂量PET重建，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，大幅减少可训练参数数量，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建可减少患者辐射暴露和缩短检查时间，但会导致噪声增加和成像细节减少，降低图像质量。需要开发能够适应不同剂量水平且参数效率高的重建方法。

Method: DCDM包含两个约束模块：核变换器约束(NTC)利用核范数近似矩阵秩最小化，将低秩特性整合到Transformer架构中；编码连接约束(ENC)利用压缩特征表示编码和控制预训练扩散模型。NTC从低剂量图像提取信息并转换为潜在空间压缩特征，ENC据此获得像素空间重建图像。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子(DRF)上优于最先进方法，在未知DRF场景下泛化良好，即使在1%全剂量的超低剂量水平也表现优异。

Conclusion: DCDM通过双约束控制器有效减少了可训练参数数量，能够灵活适应不同剂量水平而无需完全重新训练，在超低剂量PET重建中表现出优越性能和良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

Method: 提出DAOVI深度学习模型，包含基于测地距离评估时间运动信息的模块，以及在特征空间中处理几何失真的深度感知特征传播模块

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性评估上都优于现有方法

Conclusion: DAOVI模型成功解决了全景视频修复中的几何失真问题，为360度视频处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: 通过利用视频生成模型提供多视角监督信号，成功提升了单目视频人体化身重建的质量和细节表现

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

TL;DR: LightVLM是一种无需训练即可显著加速视觉语言模型推理的方法，通过分层令牌合并和KV缓存压缩技术，在保持性能的同时实现2-3倍的速度提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在推理过程中存在编码和解码阶段的高延迟问题，特别是在处理长序列时效率低下，需要一种无需重新训练的高效加速方法

Method: 将VLM推理分为编码和解码两个阶段：编码阶段使用金字塔令牌分层合并技术减少图像令牌数量；解码阶段通过KV缓存压缩移除不必要的缓存来提高网络吞吐量

Result: 仅保留35%图像令牌时可保持100%性能，保留3%图像令牌时仍维持98%性能；网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍；长序列生成时推理时间减少3.21倍

Conclusion: LightVLM能够在不损失性能的情况下显著加速大型视觉语言模型的推理过程，使重模型比小模型推理更快，有望促进实际部署应用

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

### [40] [SemaMIL: Semantic Reordering with Retrieval-Guided State Space Modeling for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00442)
*Lubin Gan,Xiaoman Wu,Jing Zhang,Zhifeng Wang,Linhao Qu,Siying Wu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemaMIL是一个新的多实例学习方法，通过语义重排序和语义引导检索状态空间模块，在计算病理学中实现了最先进的准确率，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力基MIL方法忽略了上下文关系，Transformer模型计算成本高且容易过拟合，状态空间模型虽然计算复杂度低但打乱补丁顺序会破坏组织学意义。

Method: 提出SemaMIL框架，包含语义重排序(SR)方法对语义相似的补丁进行聚类和排序，以及语义引导检索状态空间模块(SRSM)选择代表性查询子集来调整状态空间参数。

Result: 在四个WSI亚型数据集上的评估显示，SemaMIL相比强基线方法实现了最先进的准确率，同时使用更少的FLOPs和参数。

Conclusion: SemaMIL通过整合语义重排序和语义引导的状态空间建模，在保持组织学意义的同时实现了高效的全局建模，为计算病理学提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

*Bo Wu,Zhiqi Ai,Jun Jiang,Congcong Zhu,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SA-LDL算法，通过阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数，有效解决年龄估计中的标签模糊性问题，在多个数据集上取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过标签分布学习处理相邻年龄组的相关性，但忽略了不同年龄阶段标签模糊性的差异程度

Method: SA-LDL算法基于嵌入相似性分析发现标签模糊性呈现明显的阶段性模式，采用阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数

Result: 在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别取得MAE 1.74和2.15的竞争性性能

Conclusion: SA-LDL能够有效捕捉标签模糊性的复杂结构化特征，实现更准确和鲁棒的年龄估计

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR)框架，通过分离特征学习和光流估计，使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取，在保持精度的同时提升效率和光滑度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于学习的可变形图像配准中计算复杂度高和大变形处理困难的问题，分析卷积神经网络在配准中的作用机制。

Method: 基于Horn-Schunck光流方程分析ConvNets作用，提出EOIR框架：使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取，构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，通过3层光流估计器逐步组合微分同胚变形。

Result: 在5个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上验证，EOIR在精度-效率和精度-光滑度权衡方面表现优异，在可比精度下提供更好的效率和光滑度。

Conclusion: EOIR框架有效解决了可变形图像配准的挑战，实现了更好的精度-效率-光滑度平衡，代码将开源。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on
https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.

Motivation: 为研究大型语言模型的决策能力提供一个简单但具有挑战性的测试环境，通过游戏机制来评估多方面的认知能力

Method: 使用Jump-Jump游戏作为测试平台，要求模型根据当前位置和目标平台距离精确控制跳跃力度，测试空间推理、物理建模和战略规划能力

Result: 该游戏机制能够有效测试LLM在复杂决策任务中的表现，特别是涉及多认知维度的场景

Conclusion: Jump-Jump游戏是一个理想的LLM决策能力评估工具，能够全面测试空间推理、物理建模和战略规划等关键认知能力

*Zhihong Zhang,Xiaojian Huang,Jin Xu,Zhuodong Luo,Xinzhi Wang,Jiansheng Wei,Xuejin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench是首个全面的视频多模态奖励模型评估基准，涵盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个维度，包含1,563个高质量标注样本，评估28个模型发现最佳模型准确率仅57.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态奖励模型评估基准存在样本数量有限、评估维度不全面、模型类型覆盖不足等问题，需要构建更全面的评估体系。

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建包含1,563个标注样本的高质量偏好数据集，每个样本包含视频-文本提示、选择响应和拒绝响应的三元组，评估涵盖生成式、判别式和半标量三类28个多模态奖励模型。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到57.0%总体准确率，开源最佳模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B为53.3%。研究发现：RL训练不一定带来更好的跨模态泛化；除判别式模型外，其他模型可从推理时缩放中受益；视频帧数变化对不同类型模型影响不同。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域多模态奖励模型的评估和发展提供了具有挑战性和价值的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性并为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

*Zhongmiao Qi,Yan Jiang,Bolin Zhang,Lijun Guo,Chong Wang,Qiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了STVH和M-STVH两种视频哈希技术，用于细粒度群体活动检索，能够同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，并在多焦点特征学习方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂场景中视频数据的爆炸式增长，快速检索群体活动成为迫切需求。现有方法只能检索整个视频而非活动粒度，需要解决细粒度视频检索问题。

Method: STVH通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕获群体视觉特征和位置特征的时空演化。M-STVH作为增强版本，通过多焦点表示学习实现分层特征集成，能够同时关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上的对比实验表明，STVH和M-STVH都能取得优异的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的STVH和M-STVH技术有效解决了细粒度群体活动检索问题，通过时空交织哈希和多焦点特征学习实现了优秀的检索性能。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST是一个面向超声图像的双流框架，通过token驱动机制在保持源内容的同时转移目标域风格，提升下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同设备采集的超声图像存在风格差异，现有UI2I方法未能有效筛选与下游任务相关的风格特征，导致转换后的图像与任务需求不匹配

Method: 提出token驱动的双流框架，包含数据视角选择合适目标token和模型视角识别最优目标token，并注入辅助提示来匹配内容表示

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能方面均优于现有UI2I方法

Conclusion: TRUST通过显式考虑下游任务需求，有效解决了超声图像风格转换中的内容-风格分离问题，提升了跨设备应用的性能

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了黑盒蒸馏(B2D)框架，通过注意力引导的动态尺度选择方法(ATGC)，在仅能获取API模型one-hot预测的情况下，有效实现本地模型的训练和领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI即服务(AIaaS)场景下，本地模型如何利用黑盒API模型进行有效训练的问题。当前方法需要模型权重、训练数据或logits信息，而实际API通常只提供one-hot预测，现有领域适应方法无法适用。

Method: 提出ATGC方法：利用DINOv2注意力图，通过熵评分动态选择最优尺度进行黑盒模型推理。该方法识别信息丰富的尺度用于伪标签生成，实现有效的知识蒸馏。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，该方法在黑盒监督下取得了显著改进，仅需one-hot API预测即可实现有效蒸馏。

Conclusion: ATGC方法成功解决了黑盒模型蒸馏中的分辨率诅咒问题，为AIaaS场景下的模型适应提供了实用解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CISS方法存在灾难性语义纠缠问题，包括原型-特征纠缠和背景-增量纠缠，导致显著噪声和错误

Method: 语言引导的引导解耦框架(LBD)，包含语言引导原型解耦和流形互斥背景解耦，使用软提示调优和编码器适配

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上实现最先进性能，特别是在多步增量场景中表现优异

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了CISS中的语义纠缠问题，通过语言先验指导实现了更好的特征解耦和性能提升

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

TL;DR: BrainFM是一个模态无关的多任务视觉基础模型，通过创新的"轻度到重度"生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，能够处理多种脑成像任务，包括图像合成、分割、距离估计、偏置场估计和配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在校准医学成像（如CT）中表现优异，但在未校准模态（如MR）中泛化能力差，对MR对比度、分辨率和方向的差异敏感，限制了在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出BrainFM模型，采用"轻度到重度"主体内生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，使模型对获取图像的外观（如模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影）具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上评估，BrainFM在所有任务和输入模态中都表现出鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: BrainFM为脑成像提供了一个强大的基础模型，能够直接应用于多种基础任务，解决了现有方法在未校准模态中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)方法，通过交叉注意力机制整合全局场景上下文与局部特征，在细粒度车辆损伤检测任务中超越现有最佳模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiffusionDet在上下文依赖场景中性能受限，主要原因是仅使用局部特征条件化，缺乏全局场景理解

Method: 引入CAF框架，使用独立编码器生成全局上下文，通过交叉注意力机制让每个目标提议都能关注全面的环境信息

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中相比现有最佳模型有显著提升，建立了上下文感知目标检测的新性能基准

Conclusion: 全局上下文信息对于细粒度目标检测至关重要，CAF框架有效提升了生成式检测范式的性能

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但迁移到遥感图像分割面临挑战，主要由于遥感数据集类别多样性有限以及自然图像与遥感图像之间的领域差异。

Method: 提出全局-局部解耦模块：1）使用NLP技术将文本输入分解为局部类别名词和全局修饰符；2）通过无监督掩码提议网络将图像输入划分为类别无关的掩码提议。在局部层面通过上下文感知裁剪策略和遥感知识增强文本特征，在全局层面使用跨尺度Grad-CAM模块整合上下文信息。

Result: 该方法实现了开集语义分割和参考表达分割，通过掩码分类和像素级激活整合，实现了准确且可解释的全局-局部对齐。

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架有效解决了视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割中的迁移挑战，无需训练即可实现多层次的视觉-语言对齐，为遥感图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at

TL;DR: MV-SSM是一个新颖的多视角状态空间建模框架，通过投影状态空间块和网格令牌引导的双向扫描技术，显著提升了多视角3D人体姿态估计的泛化能力，在多个基准测试中大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于注意力机制的transformer在多视角3D人体姿态估计中存在两个主要问题：1）难以准确建模关键点的空间排列，特别是在遮挡场景下；2）容易过拟合训练数据中的特定相机配置和视觉场景，导致在新设置下性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出MV-SSM框架，在两个不同层次上显式建模关节空间序列：多视角图像的特征层次和人体关键点层次。引入投影状态空间（PSS）块来学习关节空间排列的泛化表示，并改进Mamba的传统扫描方式为网格令牌引导的双向扫描（GTBS）。

Result: 在多个实验中表现出强大的泛化能力：在CMU Panoptic的三相机设置上AP25提升10.8（+24%），在变化相机配置上AP25提升7.0（+13%），在跨数据集评估中Campus A1的PCP提升15.3（+38%）。

Conclusion: MV-SSM通过状态空间建模和创新的扫描机制，有效解决了多视角3D人体姿态估计中的泛化问题，为处理新相机配置和遮挡场景提供了强有力的解决方案。

particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

Motivation: 珠宝识别具有挑战性，目前主要依赖行业专家，但翻译和口译人员需要快速获取准确的珠宝信息

Method: 使用不同图像字幕架构，特别是编码器-解码器模型，在三个层次上生成自然语言描述，并构建全面的珠宝图像数据库

Result: 最终模型在字幕生成准确率方面超过90%，能够有效识别和描述各种类型的珠宝

Conclusion: 该方法为翻译和口译人员提供了快速获取珠宝准确信息的有效工具，解决了珠宝识别和描述的难题

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FtZ框架通过组合语义强大的锚定编码器和感知丰富的增强编码器，解决了MLLMs在细粒度视觉任务上的性能瓶颈，显著提升了多个基准测试的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基础视觉任务上存在缺陷，这主要源于单一视觉编码器架构在追求高级语义对齐时牺牲了细粒度视觉信息捕捉能力。

Method: 提出了FtZ（Fusion to Enhance）视觉塔框架，创新性地通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，将语义强大的锚定编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器组合起来，超越单一编码器设计。

Result: 在TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet等需要细粒度视觉理解的挑战性基准测试中，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单一编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线模型。

Conclusion: 组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的高效有效途径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出STM策略，通过参数高效微调视觉基础模型，仅使用少量正常天气数据实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计，在多个真实基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计面临缺乏可靠真值和难以从未标注真实数据学习的挑战。现有方法依赖合成数据存在域差距，或使用自监督学习违反光度假设。

Method: 提出选择-调优-保持(STM)策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩结构分解预训练权重。调优阶段自适应选择秩数和任务感知奇异方向初始化，保持阶段基于稳定秩实施主方向正则化。

Result: 在四个真实世界基准测试中，STM不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用恶劣天气合成数据训练的方法，甚至超过了深度基础模型。

Conclusion: STM策略通过参数高效微调实现了恶劣天气下的泛化深度估计，在保持预训练模型泛化能力的同时实现了灵活的任务适应。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

*Xiyao Wang,Chunyuan Li,Jianwei Yang,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文挑战了视觉语言模型中批评模型仅用于评估而不用于生成的惯例，通过将偏好标签数据集重组为可验证训练信号，在基础生成模型上进行强化学习，开发出既能优化偏好判断又保持完整生成能力的统一模型LLaVA-Critic-R1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言建模中，批评模型仅用于评估输出（分配标量分数或成对偏好），而策略模型负责生成响应，这种分离导致批评模型很少被考虑直接用于策略目的。本研究旨在打破这一惯例。

Method: 将偏好标记的批评数据集重组为可验证的训练信号，在基础生成模型上直接进行强化学习，开发出LLaVA-Critic-R1多模态批评模型，既能优化偏好判断又保持完整生成能力。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1不仅成为顶级批评模型，还是具有竞争力的策略模型，在26个视觉推理和理解基准测试中匹配或超越使用领域内数据训练的专业推理VLM，平均比基础模型(Qwen-2.5-VL-7B)提升+5.7%。扩展该方法到现有强推理VLM得到LLaVA-Critic-R1+，在7B规模上实现MMMU基准71.9的SoTA性能。

Conclusion: 在批评数据上进行RL训练可以产生一个在评估和生成方面都表现出色的统一模型，为可扩展的自改进多模态系统提供了一条简单路径。增强的批评能力还能在测试时通过自我批评带来平均+13.8%的改进。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以有效建模空间-光谱特征的长距离依赖关系。Mamba虽然计算效率高，但无法直接进行特征融合。

Method: 设计预处理模块适配Mamba结构，结合CNN提取多层特征；创新设计基于Mamba算子的跨状态模块，充分融合双模态特征；构建结合Mamba和CNN优势的更强主干网络。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在降低网络训练负担的前提下，性能优于Transformer方法。

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络成功实现了多模态特征的有效融合，在保持低计算负担的同时获得了更强的全图像理解能力，为遥感图像分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Motivation: 虽然图卷积网络(GCNs)在骨架动作识别中占主导地位，但Transformer模型和掩码预训练框架为表示学习提供了新的可能性

Method: 两阶段级联Transformer：第一阶段进行掩码预训练学习通用骨架表示，第二阶段进行级联微调用于判别性动作分类

Result: 在三个基准数据集(Penn Action、N-UCLA和NTU RGB+D 60)上均取得了有竞争力的性能

Conclusion: CascadeFormer为骨架动作识别提供了有效的Transformer解决方案，并开源了代码和模型检查点以促进可复现性

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估视觉语言模型投影层泛化能力的基准测试，通过设计不相交标签集的分割来测试对未见视觉概念的泛化性能，发现投影层在未见类别上保持了79-88%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中的投影层虽然重要，但其对未见视觉概念的泛化能力尚未得到系统评估，需要建立专门的评估框架

Method: 将目标检测数据集转换为提示格式，设计训练/测试分割确保标签集不相交，通过机制可解释性分析投影层的工作机制

Result: 投影层在未见类别上保持了79-88%的相对性能，显示即使没有对这些概念的显式对齐监督，仍具有非平凡的泛化能力

Conclusion: 投影层的前馈网络类似键值记忆机制，以相似方式处理已见和未见标记，为有限对齐数据下的高效VLM训练提供了潜力

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Motivation: 深度学习在肤疾分类中取得显著进步，但模型可能存在与肤色相关的偏见，影响诊断结果的公平性。传统公平性保障方法面临肤色分类困难、计算成本高和公平性验证复杂等挑战。

Method: 提出一种公平性算法，通过计算VGG网络卷积层和Vision Transformer的特征图偏度以及补丁和头部结构，识别并减少与肤色相关的无关通道，使模型更关注疾病区域本身。

Result: 该方法能够降低计算成本，减少偏见，同时有可能缩小模型尺寸，使得公平性提升方法更加实用化。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的公平性算法，能够在不依赖传统统计方法的情况下，通过特征图偏度分析有效减少肤色偏见，为肤疾诊断模型的公平性提供了更加高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野和输入归因技术，揭示了视觉SAE特征的真实因果驱动因素，而非仅仅依赖激活位置，从而提供更准确的特征解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过检查特征激活最高的图像块来理解稀疏自编码器特征，但由于自注意力机制在整个图像中混合信息，激活的块往往只是与特征触发共现而非因果关系，这可能导致误解。

Method: 提出Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE)方法，利用有效感受野(ERF)和输入归因方法，将每个SAE特征激活视为目标，识别真正因果驱动该激活的图像块。

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上，ERF图经常与简单激活图不同，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系。块插入测试证实CaFE比基于激活排序的块更能有效恢复或抑制特征激活。

Conclusion: CaFE提供了更忠实和语义精确的视觉SAE特征解释，凸显了仅依赖激活位置进行解释的风险，需要关注真正的因果驱动因素。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Conclusion: 结合基于语言的推理和多模态检索的方法能够有效处理复杂现实世界的图像理解任务，特别是在事件图像检索方面表现卓越

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our

TL;DR: 本文发现检测变换器在HOI检测中存在'Toxic Siblings'偏差问题，并提出两种新的去偏学习目标来分别处理输入和输出端的干扰问题，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测变换器在人类-物体交互检测中取得了显著进展，但研究发现存在'Toxic Siblings'偏差问题，即大量相似但不同的HOI三元组在交互解码器的输入和输出端相互干扰和竞争，阻碍了学习效果。

Method: 提出两种去偏学习目标：1）'contrastive-then-calibration'：采样类似但不正确的HOI三元组，通过强位置先验重构为正确三元组；2）'merge-then-split'：先学习兄弟类别的共享特征以与其他组区分，再显式细化组内差异以保持独特性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在HICO-Det数据集上比基线方法提升了9.18% mAP，比现有最优方法提升了3.59% mAP，在各种设置下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的两种去偏学习目标有效解决了HOI检测中的'Toxic Siblings'偏差问题，显著提升了检测性能，为相关领域的研究提供了新的思路和方法。

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Motivation: 现有运动生成方法主要针对孤立人物在空场景中的动画，缺乏大规模多样化物体操作的数据集，难以生成真实的人物-物体交互动作。

Method: 开发自动运动提取流水线，从4.58万个交互视频中自动收集3D人体动作和对应文本描述，构建InterPose数据集。

Result: InterPose数据集显著提升了最先进的人物动作生成方法性能，并实现了基于LLM的零样本人物与多样化物体和场景交互的动画生成。

Conclusion: InterPose数据集解决了人物-物体交互数据稀缺问题，为生成真实的人物-物体交互动作提供了重要数据基础，推动了交互式动画生成技术的发展。

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代面部检索系统常将检索阶段外包给第三方，对用户照片隐私构成威胁。同态加密虽然安全但计算效率低，不适合实时应用。

Method: 采用两阶段层次框架：(1)高速可取消产品量化索引模块用于快速候选过滤；(2)精细的密文空间检索模块用于最终精确排名。设计了专门的保护机制来保护索引模块。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在效果、效率和安全性之间取得了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: 可取消产品量化框架为安全面部表征检索提供了高效的解决方案，有效解决了隐私保护和计算效率之间的争议。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

TL;DR: 提出基于DDPM和交叉注意力机制的新型图像到脑信号生成框架，通过CLIP编码器和增强U-Net扩散模型生成生物学可信的脑信号，解决视觉假体中脑编码阶段信号生物相似性不足的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉假体研究在脑解码框架方面取得进展，但脑编码阶段生成的脑信号缺乏足够的生物相似性，且缺乏真实脑响应的监督信号来验证预测刺激的生物学合理性。

Method: 使用预训练CLIP视觉编码器提取图像语义表征，结合交叉注意力增强的U-Net扩散模型，通过迭代去噪学习重建生物学可信的脑信号。交叉注意力模块实现视觉特征与脑信号表征的动态交互。

Conclusion: 该框架通过交叉注意力机制和扩散模型成功解决了脑信号生成的生物相似性问题，为视觉假体的脑编码阶段提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

TL;DR: 提出了OmniReason框架，通过联合建模动态3D环境和底层决策过程来解决现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中缺乏时间维度推理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要关注静态场景理解，忽视了真实驾驶场景中至关重要的时间维度，存在关键局限性。

Method: 开发了OmniReason-Data大规模数据集和OmniReason-Agent架构，包含稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器，采用时空知识蒸馏方法。

Result: 在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了自动驾驶系统在复杂动态环境中的表现。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架为可解释、具有时间感知能力的自动驾驶系统建立了新的能力，有效解决了时空推理的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MI-RAG是一个多模态迭代检索增强生成框架，通过迭代检索和推理来提升知识密集型视觉问答的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理需要外部知识的视觉问题时表现有限，传统的单次检索框架往往无法获取足够的知识

Method: 提出多模态迭代RAG框架，利用累积的推理记录动态制定多查询，在异构知识库中进行联合搜索，并将新获取的知识整合到推理记录中

Result: 在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等挑战性基准测试中，MI-RAG显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确性

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答中的组合推理提供了一个可扩展的方法

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Motivation: 水下3D重建面临光线扭曲、浑浊和能见度限制等挑战，现有AI方法尚未充分利用语言模型与视觉处理的整合潜力

Method: 在多模态交叉知识框架下，为每个高斯基元嵌入额外语义特征，通过CLIP提取的语义特征进行监督，采用分阶段训练策略结合粗到细学习和后期参数优化

Result: 在SeaThru-NeRF和Submerged3D数据集上全面超越现有方法，PSNR平均提升最高3.09dB

Conclusion: 该方法为水下探索和海洋感知应用提供了强有力的候选方案，实现了语义和结构感知的高质量水下3D重建

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Motivation: 胎儿超声标准平面分类存在组织对比度低、边界模糊和操作者依赖性图像质量变化等挑战，需要一种能够适应真实世界图像质量变化的方法。

Method: 使用浅层纹理敏感网络预测临床合理的对比度参数，通过可微分映射将输入图像转换为多个对比度增强视图，并在下游分类器中进行融合。

Result: 在多中心12,400张图像的六个解剖类别数据集上验证，轻量模型准确率提升2.02%，传统模型提升1.29%，最先进模型提升1.15%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过内容感知的自适应能力和物理信息转换，有效连接低层图像特征与高层语义，为医学图像分析在真实图像质量变化下建立了新范式。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

Motivation: 需要高效的对抗攻击方法来评估计算机视觉模型的鲁棒性，重构对抗样本生成的优化目标

Method: 建立"循环-阶段-步骤"三层优化框架，初始阶段使用真实标签的负概率压缩解空间，后续阶段引入DPDR损失函数逐步增加非真实标签概率上界

Result: 相比之前SOTA方法，SDM展现出更强的攻击性能和更高的攻击成本效益，并能与对抗训练方法结合提升防御效果

Conclusion: SDM是一种有效的梯度基攻击方法，在对抗攻击和防御增强方面都具有优异表现

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Motivation: 传统纹理缺陷检测方法在噪声环境下性能不佳，需要结合局部特征和全局处理能力来提高检测精度和鲁棒性

Method: 使用U-Net进行局部特征训练，结合Vision Transformer进行全局处理；采用高斯滤波损失函数去除背景噪声；在训练过程中使用Salt-and-Pepper掩码强化纹理-缺陷边界；后处理阶段应用Gabor滤波器突出缺陷方向频率特征

Result: 在MVTec-AD、Surface Crack Detection和Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset等数据集上实现了0.939的平均AUC值，消融实验验证了最优滤波器尺寸和噪声概率对性能的提升

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合U-Net的局部特征提取和ViT的全局处理能力，配合Gabor滤波后处理，有效提升了纹理表面缺陷检测的准确性和噪声环境下的鲁棒性

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

Motivation: 现有方法通常采用两步流水线（先估计相机位姿，再优化3D高斯），但运动模糊会破坏位姿估计，导致误差累积和重建质量下降。

Method: 将相机和物体运动重新表述为每个基元的SE(3)仿射变换，制定统一优化目标，并采用三阶段训练策略：先固定位姿训练高斯，再固定高斯优化位姿，最后联合优化所有参数。

Result: 在Stereo Blur数据集和真实世界序列上的实验表明，该方法在重建质量和位姿估计精度方面相比现有动态去模糊方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一的端到端优化框架有效解决了运动模糊导致的位姿估计问题，显著提高了动态3D场景重建的质量和精度。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Conclusion: SegDINO设计最小化可训练参数，同时保留基础特征的表示能力，提供了高效的分割解决方案。

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用全景扩散模型从输入图像学习场景先验生成360度全景；2) 从全景中采样并扭曲关键帧，通过预训练视频扩散模型和空间噪声扩散过程生成新视角

Result: 在多样化场景数据集上的实验表明，该方法在用户定义轨迹上生成连贯视图方面优于现有方法，即使在循环闭合场景中也能保持全局一致性

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解策略和关键帧条件化，有效解决了单视图新视角合成的长期一致性问题，同时支持灵活的相机控制

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FQAT方法，通过层间冻结机制和梯度无序度指标来解决量化感知训练中的OOD泛化性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量化感知训练方法主要关注I.D数据性能，忽视了OOD数据上的性能下降问题。研究发现QAT会导致尖锐的损失景观，这与平坦损失景观有利于OOD泛化的观点相矛盾。

Method: 提出FQAT方法：1）引入层间冻结机制缓解双优化目标的梯度冲突；2）提出无序引导的自适应冻结算法动态确定冻结层；3）设计梯度无序度指标识别训练中的不稳定层。

Result: 在多个有影响力的OOD基准测试上，FQAT在I.D和OOD图像分类任务中都优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: FQAT方法有效解决了QAT中的OOD泛化问题，通过平坦化损失景观实现了更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集和双重表征框架(DRF)，解决了基于姿态数据的特发性筛查中的数据稀缺和噪声敏感问题，并通过结合连续骨枱图和离散不对称向量实现了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI特发性筛查方法主要依赖大规模边缘数据，忽视了临床相关的姿态不对称性。而姿态数据虽然更直观，但因为数据稀缺和噪声敏感问题导致研究不足。

Method: 构建Scoliosis1K-Pose姿态数据集(447,900帧图像)，提出双重表征框架(DRF)，结合连续骨枱图和离散不对称向量(PAV)，以及PAV导向注意力模块(PGA)来提取临床意义上的不对称特征。

Result: DRF框架达到了状态最优性能，可视化结果证明模型能够利用临床不对称线索来指导特征提取，促进双重表征的协同作用。

Conclusion: 该研究为姿态基于特发性筛查提供了数据集和方法支持，通过结合连续和离散表征有效解决了临床不对称性检测的挑战，提高了模型的可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://zhouzi180.github.io/Scoliosis1K/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一个轻量级token选择框架，通过评估视觉token的激活值并保留高分token来提升提示调优的准确性和效率，在11个少样本基准测试中显著优于CLIP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的成功证明了提示调优可以实现跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关特征组件会引入噪声并增加不必要的计算成本。

Method: 提出Spotlighter框架，从样本级和语义级角度评估每个视觉token的激活，仅保留得分最高的token进行下游预测；使用类别特定的语义记忆库来精化选择；引入两级排序机制动态加权token-原型交互。

Result: 在11个少样本基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在调和平均准确率上提升高达11.19%，额外FPS达到0.8K，仅增加21个参数。

Conclusion: Spotlighter被证明是提示调优中有效且可扩展的基线方法。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

TL;DR: DarkVRAI框架在AIM 2025低光RAW视频去噪挑战赛中获第一名，通过条件化方案和BOSS机制实现最佳性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光RAW视频中由于高传感器增益和短曝光时间导致的严重信号退化问题

Method: 结合条件化方案（利用捕获元数据指导对齐和去噪）和Burst-Order Selective Scan机制（建模长程时间依赖）

Result: 在严谨真实基准数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: 为低光视频去噪设立了新标准

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁对AI模型鲁棒性构成重大挑战，特别是在目标检测等计算机视觉任务中，需要更高效的生成方法来应对这种威胁。

Method: 采用增量补丁生成(IPG)方法，通过实验和消融研究验证其有效性，包括YOLO特征分布可视化和对抗训练结果分析。

Result: IPG生成具有良好泛化能力的补丁，能有效覆盖更广泛的模型漏洞，生成的对抗数据集可作为构建鲁棒模型的知识基础。

Conclusion: IPG在对抗补丁防御和自动驾驶、安防系统、医疗成像等实际应用中具有巨大潜力，能提升AI模型在动态高风险环境中的抗攻击能力。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

TL;DR: LangDC是一种语言感知的动态token压缩器，通过轻量级语言模型生成视频描述来动态调整压缩比例，在减少49%计算量的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频token压缩方法采用固定压缩比例，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的差异性，导致信息丰富片段表示不足而静态片段计算浪费。

Method: 使用轻量级语言模型生成视频片段的软描述token作为视觉表示，通过语义密度感知监督训练，根据场景丰富度动态调整压缩比例。

Result: 实验结果显示方法相比VideoGPT+减少49%的FLOPs，同时保持竞争性性能，并能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整压缩比例。

Conclusion: LangDC通过模仿人类动态描述视觉场景的方式，实现了高效且自适应的视频token压缩，为视频理解任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在RGB数据上表现优异，但对多光谱数据的简单逐波段优化会导致几何重建不一致的问题，需要研究如何有效整合多光谱信息。

Method: 评估了三种策略：1) 独立逐波段重建；2) 分割优化（先优化RGB几何，然后复制并拟合新波段）；3) 联合优化（可选先进行RGB-only阶段）。

Result: 专用优化的联合策略在多光谱数据集上通过定量指标和定性新视角渲染展示了有效性，提高了整体光谱重建质量，并通过光谱串扰增强了RGB结果。

Conclusion: 建议将多光谱数据直接整合到球谐颜色组件中，以紧凑建模每个高斯的多光谱反射率，并揭示了在优化过程中引入光谱波段的关键权衡和实用见解。

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Motivation: 雨天天气显著增加道路事故风险，了解经验丰富的司机在恶劣天气条件下的视觉注意模式对于设计鲁棒的驾驶员监控系统(DMS)和高级驾驶辅助系统(ADAS)至关重要。

Method: 采用两步聚类方法分析眼动数据：首先在10秒间隔内对注视点进行聚类，然后将聚类中心聚合成元聚类。结合马尔可夫转移矩阵、注视持续时间、视线仰角和方位角分布等指标进行分析。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了恶劣天气条件下视觉注意模式的宝贵见解，强调了利用注视建模辅助设计更鲁棒的ADAS和DMS的潜力。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Conclusion: CompSlider通过解耦多个属性并利用条件先验，实现了更可靠和独立的属性操作，为同时精确控制多个图像属性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了现实世界中玻璃表面多种污染物的图像恢复问题，通过测试时自适应机制实现了对未知污染类型的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

*Chenlu Zhan,Wen Li,Chuyu Shen,Jun Zhang,Suhui Wu,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双向稀疏注意力(BSA)框架，通过动态稀疏化查询和键值对，显著提升视频扩散Transformer的训练和推理效率，减少20倍FLOPs并保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型在生成高质量视频时面临二次复杂度注意力机制的计算瓶颈，训练和推理成本过高，需要解决查询和键值对的稀疏性问题

Method: BSA框架包含两个关键组件：通过语义相似度选择信息量最大的查询token，以及使用统计动态阈值保留最重要的KV块进行计算

Result: BSA在长序列训练中显著加速DiT，减少20倍FLOPs，实现17.79倍注意力训练加速，同时保持甚至超越全注意力的生成质量

Conclusion: BSA框架有效解决了视频DiT模型的计算效率问题，为高分辨率长视频生成提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEPE是一个端到端的视频姿态估计框架，通过时空Transformer组件和实例一致性机制，解决了传统两阶段方法效率低和时空上下文分离的问题，在Posetrack数据集上表现优异且推理效率提升300%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频姿态估计方法采用两阶段流程（检测+时序建模），存在时空维度分离、无法端到端优化、依赖复杂后处理（RoI裁剪、NMS）导致推理效率低的问题。

Method: 提出VEPE框架，包含三个核心时空Transformer组件：时空姿态编码器(STPE)、时空可变形记忆编码器(STDME)、时空姿态解码器(STPD)，并引入实例一致性机制来增强跨帧实例查询的一致性和差异性，实现实例跟踪功能。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于大多数两阶段模型，并将推理效率提高了300%。

Conclusion: VEPE提供了一个简单灵活的端到端视频姿态估计解决方案，有效利用了时序上下文信息，同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Motivation: 现有点云压缩方法通常顺序处理全局和局部信息，缺乏这两种信息之间的有效通信，影响了重建点云的质量。

Method: 提出点-体素交错网络(PVINet)，包含体素编码器提取全局结构特征和点编码器建模局部上下文，引入条件稀疏卷积动态定制卷积核，实现从点编码器到体素编码器的特征交互。

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理全局和局部特征并进行有效交互，提升了点云压缩的重建质量，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的立体视觉Transformer模型，通过处理双视角X光图像来同时实现式管分割和3D力估计，在性能上超越了现有的独立分割和力估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务深度学习模型已能通过绘制和力估计头部提供触觉和视觉感知数据，但基于CNN的编码器-解码器结构在捕捉长程依赖关系方面有限。需要从新角度解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的编码器-解码器Vision Transformer模型，将两张X光图像作为独立序列处理。该模型通过Transformer机制捕捉长程依赖关系，无需逐渐扩大感受野。编码器和解码器的嵌入被输入到两个共享分割头部，而回归头部利用解码器融合信息进行3D力估计。

Conclusion: 这种立体视觉Transformer模型能够同时从两个角度分割式管并估计其尖端产生的3D力，为式管插入手术提供了更加准确和高效的触觉-视觉感知能力，在医疗图像分析和手术辅助领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FICGen方法，通过频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式，解决退化场景下布局到图像生成的上下文幻觉困境，显著提升生成质量和布局对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有布局到图像生成方法在退化场景（如低光照、水下）中存在生成保真度有限和与用户提供布局对齐弱的问题，主要归因于退化条件下的"上下文幻觉困境"。

Method: 提出频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式(FICGen)：1）可学习的双查询机制配合频率重采样器提取上下文频率原型；2）视觉频率增强注意力注入频率原型；3）实例一致性图和自适应空间频率聚合模块实现解耦和重建。

Result: 在5个基准测试上的大量实验表明，FICGen在各种退化场景下（从严重低光照到轻度模糊）在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面 consistently超越现有L2I方法。

Conclusion: FICGen通过将退化图像的频率知识转移到潜在扩散空间，有效解决了退化场景中的上下文幻觉问题，为布局到图像生成在挑战性环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken是一种基于高斯参数化的空间自适应图像标记化框架，使用2D高斯分布动态建模不同图像区域的形状、位置和纹理，实现非均匀图像表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于均匀的2D/1D网格标记化，无法灵活表示不同形状、纹理和位置的图像区域，限制了特征表示的有效性。

Method: 采用熵驱动算法将图像分割为纹理均匀的可变大小区域，每个区域用2D高斯（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）和纹理特征参数化，通过专用transformer优化高斯参数，使用可微分渲染器重建特征图。

Result: 在图像重建和生成任务中，使用128个token实现了rFID 0.65和FID 1.50的先进性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过解耦空间布局和纹理特征，实现了高效的两阶段生成，在图像表示和生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法主要关注生成参考预测的策略，但忽略了标注数据中的潜在噪声和不同未标注像素的异质性价值，需要更有效地挖掘两个预测中的丰富信息

Method: 基于空间异质性损失，将未标注数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），并采用自适应阈值区分置信预测和可疑预测，同时对标注图像也应用异质性损失以考虑标注噪声

Result: 实验结果表明，当与现有SSL框架集成时，在不同数据集上显著提高了分割性能

Conclusion: MetaSSL是一个即插即用的通用框架，能够有效提升现有半监督学习方法在医学图像分割中的表现，特别是在处理标注噪声和像素异质性方面表现出色

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Result: 大量实验证明各组件有效性，性能优于之前最先进方法

Conclusion: MVTrajecter通过利用多时间戳轨迹信息，显著提升了多视角行人跟踪的关联鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型依赖视觉语言编码器进行关键帧采样，但这些编码器是否能真正识别最具信息量的帧尚不清楚，需要实证研究。

Method: 通过实证分析，提供了多个证据揭示流行视觉编码器在识别MLLM应该关注视频中哪些位置以处理给定文本查询方面的有限能力。

Result: 发现现有视觉编码器在关键帧识别方面存在严重缺陷，无法有效指导MLLM关注视频中的相关信息区域。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的关键帧识别技术来支持高效视频多模态大语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM范式为无监督分割质量评估提供了鲁棒且可迁移的解决方案，在遥感图像分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

Motivation: 解决森林监测中缺乏高分辨率树高预测训练数据的关键缺口，使基于多时相观测的深度学习树高预测成为可能。

Method: 提出编码器-解码器框架，输入多时相多光谱影像和相对时间差异，预测冠层高度。使用U-Net架构在PrediTree数据集上进行训练。

Result: U-Net架构获得最佳性能，掩码均方误差为11.78%，比ResNet-50提升约12%，比仅使用RGB波段实验误差降低约30%。

Conclusion: PrediTree数据集成功填补了森林监测数据空白，U-Net架构在该数据集上表现出色，为高精度树高预测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This
dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing
and training codebases are available on \href{URL}{GitHub}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DcMatch是一个无监督学习框架，通过形状图注意力网络和多域一致性损失，实现非刚性多形状匹配的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法仅从单一形状学习规范嵌入的局限性，需要捕获整个形状集合的底层流形结构以获得更一致的点对点对应关系。

Method: 使用形状图注意力网络构建共享潜在空间，通过宇宙预测器建立形状到宇宙的对应关系，同时在空间域和谱域表示对应关系，并采用新颖的循环一致性损失确保对齐。

Conclusion: DcMatch通过利用整个形状集合的结构信息和双域一致性约束，显著提升了非刚性多形状匹配的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Conclusion: 该工作为虚拟染色提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，推动了计算病理学领域的发展

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效构建高质量文档提取数据集和模型，处理多样化文档格式和布局，为复杂文档处理领域提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Conclusion: FantasyHSI通过创新的多智能体架构和闭环反馈机制，有效解决了HSI中的长期一致性和物理真实性问题，为复杂环境下的逼真人类行为生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Conclusion: 双视图交叉重建相比单视图自重建能提供更具挑战性的预训练任务，在3D自监督学习领域表现优异

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news

event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search

Conclusion: FSS-TIs通过ODE和傅里叶变换的一体化设计，有效解决了跨域小样本分割问题，在多个不同域数据集上展现出优越性能和良好泛化能力

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

*Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合激光雷达超分辨率和语义分割的端到端框架，通过聚合优化和轻量级模型实现了在低成本低分辨率传感器上达到高分辨率效果的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率LiDAR传感器成本高限制了大规模部署，而低成本传感器产生的稀疏点云会降低语义分割准确性，需要找到一种方法来克服这个问题。

Method: 设计了端到端的聚合优化框架，让超分辨率模块能够利用语义线索和保留细小细节，并提出了新的超分辨率损失函数来指导网络关注关键区域。采用轻量级模型基础的超分辨率架构，参数量显著少于现有方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在语义分割性能上可以达到与使用高成本64通道LiDAR数据的模型相当的效果。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效的解决方案，能够在低成本传感器上实现类似高分辨率传感器的语义分割性能，为自动驾驶领域的大规模部署提供了可行性。

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中存在模糊性，需要能够捕捉完整条件分布而非单点估计的模型

Method: 将离散标签嵌入连续空间作为one-hot目标，使用粗粒度先验预测器提供逐步指导，扩散网络学习残差，采用深度扩散监督方案稳定训练

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上，PGRD相比贝叶斯、集成、Probabilistic U-Net和普通扩散基线获得更高的Dice分数和更低的NLL/ECE值，且需要更少的采样步骤

Conclusion: PGRD框架能够有效处理医学图像分割中的模糊性问题，在保持强校准性的同时提高了采样效率

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Motivation: 随着社交媒体数据和智能手机摄像头的普及，传统计算机视觉技术在图像定位方面遇到趋势，需要更有效的解决方案来支持导航、位置推荐和城市规划等关键应用。

Method: 方法构建了一个使用SigLIP编码器在两个大规模数据集(EMP-16和OSV-5M)上的向量数据库，通过检索增强生成技术从数据库中获取相似和不相似的地理位置信息来增强查询图像，然后由多模态大语言模型处理。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了检索增强生成技术基于多模态大语言模型在地理定位估计中的有效性，为传统从头开始训练模型的方法提供了替代方案，为GeoAI领域开启了更易访问和可扩展解决方案的新可能性。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3Ret是一个统一的多模态医学图像检索模型，通过自监督学习在包含2D、3D和视频医学数据的大规模数据集上训练，无需模态特定定制，在零样本检索任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法针对不同模态使用分离的架构和训练策略，这种模态特定的设计限制了可扩展性，阻碍了统一表示的发展。

Method: 构建包含867,653个医学影像样本的混合模态数据集，使用生成式(MAE)和对比式(SimDINO)自监督学习范式训练统一的视觉编码器M3Ret，无需任何模态特定定制。

Result: 在所有单个模态的零样本图像检索中达到新的最先进水平，超越DINOv3和BMC-CLIP等强基线；在没有配对数据的情况下实现强跨模态对齐；模型能够泛化到未见过的MRI任务。

Conclusion: M3Ret展示了纯视觉自监督学习对未见模态的泛化能力，为多模态医学图像理解的基础模型发展迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Conclusion: TPIGE框架以最小成本实现性能提升，展示了最先进的性能和强泛化能力

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement

Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform

three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions

Motivation: 现有PRVR方法容易受到查询歧义性和视频部分相关性带来的伪语义关联影响，导致性能不佳，需要显式建模数据不确定性

Method: 1) 将视频和查询编码为多元高斯分布进行概率建模 2) 引入可学习的置信门控动态加权相似度 3) 作为即插即用方案集成到现有架构

Result: 在多种检索骨干网络上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: RAL框架通过显式建模数据不确定性，有效解决了PRVR中的跨模态对齐挑战，提升了检索性能

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: RibPull是一种利用隐式占用场连接计算几何和医学影像的方法，通过神经占用场表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取中轴，相比体素网格能更好地处理稀疏数据和几何操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体素网格在医学影像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，而隐式3D表示能更有效地处理稀疏和噪声数据，保留复杂几何信息。

Method: 使用神经占用场预测3D点是否在物体内部来表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取胸腔的中轴。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上进行了评估，证明了连续坐标基3D场景表示相比体素基表示的优越性。

Conclusion: 隐式占用场为医学影像中的几何操作提供了更好的解决方案，能够有效处理稀疏数据并保持几何完整性。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

TL;DR: Neural Scene Designer (NSD) 是一个新颖的图像编辑框架，通过并行交叉注意力机制和渐进式自风格表示学习模块，实现了语义控制和风格一致性的双重目标，并建立了全面的评估基准。


<details>

Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法主要关注生成内容的语义控制，往往忽视了保持风格一致性的关键任务，这对于图像的连贯性和美学吸引力至关重要。

Method: NSD采用先进的扩散模型，包含两个并行交叉注意力机制分别处理文本和风格信息。提出渐进式自风格表示学习(PSRL)模块，使用风格对比损失来学习细粒度风格表示。

Conclusion: NSD框架成功解决了图像编辑中的风格一致性问题，通过创新的注意力机制和风格学习模块，为图像编辑和修复任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

*Uğur Çoğalan,Mojtaba Bemana,Karol Myszkowski,Hans-Peter Seidel,Colin Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILO是一个轻量级的多尺度感知度量方法，用于全参考图像质量评估，通过伪MOS监督训练，在图像和潜在空间中都能作为感知损失函数使用，在多项图像处理任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像质量评估方法需要大规模人工标注数据集，计算成本高且难以实时应用。需要开发一种轻量级但准确的感知度量方法，既能评估图像质量，又能作为优化工具用于生成式任务。

Method: 使用伪MOS监督训练，通过可复现的失真处理多样图像，并用考虑视觉掩蔽效应的最新质量度量集合进行评分。在潜在空间优化中结合空间掩蔽和课程学习策略，先处理感知相关性较低的区域，再逐步优化视觉失真严重的区域。

Result: MILO在标准FR-IQA基准测试中超越现有度量方法，推理速度快适合实时应用。作为感知损失函数在去噪、超分辨率、人脸修复等任务中显著提升性能，同时减少计算开销。

Conclusion: MILO既是先进的图像质量度量工具，又是生成式流程中实用的感知优化工具，通过空间掩蔽和课程学习策略实现了高效的感知对齐优化。

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Conclusion: InfoScale通过信息中心化的方法有效解决了扩散模型在变尺度图像生成中的关键问题，为多分辨率图像生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Conclusion: 验证了CNN与选择性SSM结合的协同潜力，为精细视觉理解任务提供了强大的新架构范式

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合真实和合成数据学习头发先验知识，有效解决了单视图头发重建的挑战，能够在保持头发整体3D结构的同时实现对可见头发线维的准确建模

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

TL;DR: PointSlice是一种新颖的点云处理方法，通过将3D点云水平切片成多组2D数据，结合切片交互网络(SIN)保持垂直关系，在保持高精度的同时显著提升推理速度和减少参数数量。

Motivation: 解决当前点云处理中体素方法精度高但速度慢、柱状方法速度快但精度不足的问题，寻求在精度和速度之间取得更好平衡的方案。

Method: 提出PointSlice方法：1) 将3D点云沿水平面切片转换为多组2D数据；2) 引入切片交互网络(SIN)在2D骨干网络中保持切片间的垂直关系；3) 模型仅学习2D数据分布，减少参数数量。

Conclusion: PointSlice通过创新的点云切片处理和切片交互网络，成功实现了在自动驾驶3D目标检测中精度与速度的良好平衡，为实时应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的3D形状生成建立了一个实用框架，实现了高几何保真度的快速生成。

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Conclusion: MSA2-Net展現了在醫學影像分割任務中的強健性和精確性，能有效處理不同數據集的特徵

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Conclusion: V²Drop提供了一种有效的令牌压缩解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了LVLM的计算效率，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

TL;DR: Keye-VL-1.5是一个创新的多模态大语言模型，通过慢快视频编码策略、渐进式预训练和综合后训练流程，显著提升了视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理视频内容时面临空间分辨率和时间覆盖之间的权衡问题，视频理解仍然是具有挑战性的领域。

Method: 采用慢快视频编码策略（基于帧间相似性动态分配计算资源）、四阶段渐进式预训练（上下文长度从8K扩展到128K tokens）和综合后训练流程（包括思维链数据构建、GSPO强化学习和对齐训练）。

Result: 在公共基准测试和严格的人工评估中，Keye-VL-1.5相比现有模型有显著改进，在视频理解任务中表现优异，同时在通用多模态基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该模型通过三项关键技术创新有效解决了视频理解中的基本挑战，为动态信息密集的视频内容处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

TL;DR: ViSTA-SLAM是一个无需相机内参的实时单目视觉SLAM系统，采用轻量级对称双视图关联模型作为前端，后端构建专门的Sim(3)位姿图，在相机跟踪和稠密3D重建方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个无需相机内参的通用视觉SLAM系统，使其能够适用于各种不同的相机设置，同时降低模型复杂度并提高性能。

Method: 前端使用轻量级对称双视图关联(STA)模型，仅从两张RGB图像同时估计相对相机位姿和回归局部点云图；后端构建包含闭环检测的Sim(3)位姿图来处理累积漂移。

Result: 前端模型大小仅为同类最先进方法的35%，同时在相机跟踪和稠密3D重建质量方面实现了优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM提供了一个高效且通用的视觉SLAM解决方案，通过创新的前端设计和后端优化，在减少模型复杂度的同时提升了系统性能。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

TL;DR: O-DisCo-Edit是一个统一的视频编辑框架，通过新颖的对象失真控制信号和复制形式保护模块，实现了高效、高保真的多样化视频编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频编辑中需要不同的控制信号来处理不同的编辑任务，这使得模型设计复杂且需要大量训练资源。为了解决这个问题，需要开发一个统一的框架来灵活处理多种编辑需求。

Method: 提出了O-DisCo-Edit框架，包含基于随机和自适应噪声的对象失真控制信号，以及用于保护未编辑区域的"复制形式"保护模块，通过有效的训练范式实现编辑。

Result: 大量实验和全面的人工评估表明，O-DisCo-Edit在各种视频编辑任务中都超越了专门的单任务和多任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: O-DisCo-Edit提供了一个统一的解决方案，能够通过单一表示灵活封装多种编辑线索，在保持高效率的同时实现高质量的编辑效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过Panel-of-Peers学习框架，利用多个LVLM模型组成同行评审团队，通过迭代自我改进过程实现模型对齐，免除了对人工标注数据的依赖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LVLM对齐方法依赍人工偏好数据成本高、机器生成数据质量有限、自监督数据容易引入幽灵问题等限制

Method: 受人类协作学习启发，构建同行评审团队框架，多个LVLM模型通过迭代过程生成、评估和精炼输出，模拟课堂学习环境

Result: 在十五个测试集上平均分数从48%提升到57%，显著提升模型性能且无需大量人工标签数据

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers框架为LVLM对齐提供了一种可扩展的自监督替代方案，通过同行评估机制有效解决了传统方法的数据限制问题

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型调度器而非模型权重，在4倍模型压缩下实现全精度准确率，显著提升few-step扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高昂，few-step模型虽然减少了去噪步骤但仍依赖大型未压缩主干网络，限制了在非数据中心GPU上的部署和现有后训练量化方法的效果。

Method: 提出Q-Sched范式，通过修改扩散模型调度器来调整few-step采样轨迹；引入JAQ损失函数，结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标进行细粒度优化，无需全精度推理校准。

Result: 相比FP16 4步潜在一致性模型提升15.5% FID，相比FP16 8步分阶段一致性模型提升16.6% FID；大规模用户研究（超过80,000个标注）证实了在FLUX.1和SDXL-Turbo上的有效性。

Conclusion: 量化与few-step蒸馏在高保真生成方面具有互补性，Q-Sched为高效扩散模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

TL;DR: OpenVision 2通过移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式标题损失，显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性，同时保持与原模型相当的多模态性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升OpenVision架构的训练效率，减少训练时间和内存消耗，同时保持模型性能，为多模态基础模型的视觉编码器开发提供更轻量化的生成式范式。

Method: 移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅使用生成式标题损失进行纯生成式训练，简化了原OpenVision的架构设计。

Result: 训练时间减少约1.5倍（83小时→57小时），内存使用减少约1.8倍（24.5GB→13.8GB），批次大小从2k增至8k，参数规模可超过10亿，在多模态基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 纯生成式训练范式在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，为未来多模态基础模型的视觉编码器开发提供了有前景的轻量化方案。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Conclusion: 通过强化学习有效提升多模态LLM的视觉工具使用能力，为RL-based视觉工具使用提供了新的见解

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive
ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous

Method: 使用ResNet50和DINOv2架构，在分类器前加入可选的PCA步骤将数据降至3维，然后输入三层分类器进行多标签分类

Result: PCA的有效性强烈依赖于所选的深度学习架构和训练策略，不同架构对PCA的响应不同

Conclusion: 研究为自监督预训练和替代降维方法的未来研究开辟了道路，PCA在多标签多光谱分类中的应用需要根据具体架构进行优化

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures

Motivation: 限角计算断层成像(LACT)虽能提高时间分辨率和降低放射强度，但因投影截断导致严重伪影，需要解决这个痴立问题

Method: 两阶段死亡框架：第一阶段基于Transformer的模型仅使用元数据生成粗糕解剖前知；第二阶段整合粗糕前知和元数据进行精细化。每个取样步骤都通过ADMM模块强制物理数据一致性

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上验证，结果显示包含元数据显著提高了重建保真度，特别是在严重角度截断条件下。在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上都超过现有无元数据基线方法

Conclusion: 不同类型的元数据提供互补性好处，特别是诊断和人口统计前知在限角条件下优势明显。临床元数据在改善重建质量和效率方面发挥双重作用，支持将其集成到未来的元数据导向医学成像框架中

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to
the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper
introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect

TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches.
Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images
demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

Motivation: 现实世界中的视觉识别数据通常是长尾分布的，这给深度神经网络的高效训练和部署带来了挑战。传统信息瓶颈方法在处理长尾数据时存在不足，需要改进以适应不平衡数据场景。

Method: BIB方法将损失函数重平衡和自蒸馏技术集成到原始信息瓶颈网络中；MBIB进一步采用多个BIB混合结构，不同BIB负责结合不同网络层的知识，实现端到端的表示学习和分类训练。

Conclusion: 所提出的BIB和MBIB方法能够从信息论角度有效学习包含完整标签相关信息的充分表示，为长尾视觉识别任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB

Result: 在多种场景类型上实现了最先进的性能，在质量和控制方面表现出色，同时具有参数和数据效率优势。

Conclusion: 通过挖掘基础模型的知识，图像光照控制是可行的，该方法实现了实用且通用的重光照效果。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

TL;DR: LGDiST是首个无参考的潜在基因扩散模型，用于解决空间转录组学数据丢失问题，在26个数据集上平均MSE降低18%，并显著提升其他基因表达预测方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于计算机视觉的空间转录组学分析方法受数据丢失问题限制，且依赖单细胞RNA测序参考数据，存在对齐质量、批次效应和数据丢失继承等问题。

Method: 提出LGDiST模型，使用先前被认为无信息的上下文基因构建丰富的生物学意义遗传潜在空间，采用扩散模型完成基因表达数据。

Result: 在26个数据集上平均MSE降低18%，在6种最先进方法上提升基因表达预测性能达10%（MSE指标）。关键组件（上下文基因、ST潜在空间、邻居条件）的移除都会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LGDiST通过完整的架构设计，在无参考数据的情况下显著提升了空间转录组学数据完成和基因表达预测的性能，证明了其各组件协同工作的重要性。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets

Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,
wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging
the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust
training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware
bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,

Conclusion: 这是首次将可解释性引入全球地理定位的研究，通过概念对齐方法同时提高了模型性能和可解释性

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in

applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

*Ziyun Zeng,Junhao Zhang,Wei Li,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Draw-In-Mind (DIM)数据集和模型，通过将设计责任明确分配给理解模块来解决多模态统一模型中图像编辑能力不足的问题，在较小参数量下实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态统一模型在文本到图像生成方面表现良好，但在精确图像编辑方面存在困难。作者认为这是由于职责分配不平衡造成的——理解模块仅作为翻译器，而生成模块需要同时承担设计师和画家的角色。

Method: 构建DIM数据集（包含14M长上下文图像-文本对和233K GPT-4o生成的思维链想象），通过轻量级两层MLP连接冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B，在DIM数据集上训练得到DIM-4.6B模型。

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争性性能，超越了参数量大得多的UniWorld-V1和Step1X-Edit等模型。

Conclusion: 将设计责任明确分配给理解模块能显著提升图像编辑性能，证明了这种职责重新分配方法的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

*Elad Aharoni,Noy Porat,Dani Lischinski,Ariel Shamir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter是一种新颖的方法，用于在文本到图像扩散模型中根据用户指定的调色板进行条件生成。该方法通过将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入熵和距离控制参数，以及负直方图机制，实现了稳定的调色板条件图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调色板作为创意工作流程中广泛使用的直观工具，在用于图像生成条件时存在显著的模糊性和不稳定性问题，需要一种能够稳定控制调色板条件的方法。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入两个标量控制参数（直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离），采用负直方图机制抑制不需要的色调，并在精心策划的数据集上进行训练以确保颜色空间的广泛泛化。

Result: 通过定性、定量和用户研究评估，该方法在实现强调色板一致性和高图像质量方面始终优于现有方法，能够生成语义连贯的图像。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter提供了一种有效的方法来解决调色板条件图像生成中的模糊性和不稳定性问题，实现了灵活的控制和高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于视觉的边缘计算框架，使用量化的MobileNet模型在Raspberry Pi上实现无侵入性的早产儿行为状态监测，在保持高准确度的同时实现了计算效率优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产儿死亡率高，特别是在资源稀缺地区，传统的手动监测和侵入式传感器存在错误多、不实用和可能造成皮肤损伤等问题。

Method: 设计了一种嵌入式监测系统，采用量化的MobileNet模型部署在Raspberry Pi上，通过视觉管道进行实时行为状态检测，包括模型量化、硬件优化和安全IoT通信等技术。

Result: 系统在公开的新生儿图像数据集上达到了状态前沿的准确率（睡眠检测91.8%，哭泣/正常分类97.7%），同时减少了68%的模型大小，适合边缘部署。

Conclusion: 轻量级优化模型如MobileNet是建立可扩展、低成本且临床可行的NICU监测系统的最佳基础，为资源稀缺环境中的早产儿护理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言-视觉理解方面取得进展，但其可靠性和鲁棒性研究不足，特别是在安全性和对抗攻击方面存在未探索的漏洞。

Method: 提出VEIL对抗框架，利用FIFO内存漏洞进行时空推理攻击，通过数字和物理扰动破坏RMOT的参考匹配机制，在Refer-KITTI数据集上进行全面评估。

Conclusion: 研究强调了RMOT系统在关键大规模应用中需要安全感知设计，暴露了现有模型在对抗攻击下的严重安全漏洞。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Motivation: 传统对比自监督学习依赖大量真实数据和精心策划的硬负样本，本文旨在探索使用合成数据增强样本多样性以及生成合成硬负样本的可行性。

Method: 提出Syn2Co框架，结合两种"伪造"方法：1）使用生成模型创建合成数据增强样本多样性；2）在表示空间中生成合成硬负样本创建多样化挑战性对比。在DeiT-S和Swin-T架构上进行评估。

Result: 研究发现合成数据在自监督学习中具有潜力但也存在局限性，为未来研究方向提供了见解。

Conclusion: 合成增强训练可以产生更鲁棒和可迁移的视觉表示，但合成数据的使用仍存在限制，为自监督学习领域提供了新的探索方向。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有slot attention方法存在两个关键局限：(1)缺乏高层语义信息，仅基于颜色和纹理等低层特征分配图像区域；(2)无法微调编码器，限制了对象中心学习的灵活性

Method: 提出ContextFusion阶段利用前景和背景的语义信息，加入辅助指示器提供额外上下文线索；Bootstrap Branch将特征适应与原始重建阶段解耦，引入引导策略训练特征适应机制

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了不同SOTA slot attention模型在模拟和真实数据集上的性能

Conclusion: 所提出的ContextFusion和Bootstrap Branch能够无缝集成到现有slot attention模型中，有效解决了语义信息不足和编码器灵活性受限的问题

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

Motivation: 现有表面异常检测方法擅长检测结构异常（如凹痕、划痕），但在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）检测上表现不佳。现有最佳方法依赖聚合预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，包含新设计的组合分支来显式建模物体组合图分布，学习重要语义关系。同时引入无需手工标签或类别特定信息的组合图提取新流程。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上显著超越现有最先进方法，达到96.1%的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: 通过有效建模组合图分布，SALAD方法在逻辑异常检测方面取得了显著改进，证明了语义感知方法的重要性。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CFpano数据集和基于GRPO的MLLM方法，用于解决跨帧相关全景图的视觉问答任务，在360度场景理解方面取得SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全向场景理解对下游应用至关重要，但现有方法仅关注单帧而忽略了跨帧相关全景图，需要填补这一空白

Method: 构建CFpano数据集（2700+图像，8000+问答对），提出基于Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）和定制奖励函数的多模态大语言模型方法

Result: 在CFpano基准测试中，该方法在多项选择和开放式VQA任务上均达到最先进性能，整体性能提升5.37%

Conclusion: 验证了GRPO的有效性，为全景场景理解建立了新的基准，推动了跨帧相关全景图理解的发展

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

TL;DR: RocketScience是一个开源对比视觉语言模型基准测试，专门测试空间关系理解能力，包含全新的真实世界图像-文本对，主要涵盖相对空间理解和物体顺序。该基准对人类很简单但对当前VLM模型很困难，测试结果显示开源和前沿商业VLM在空间关系理解方面存在显著不足，而推理模型表现意外优秀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间关系理解方面存在明显短板，需要专门的基准测试来评估和改进模型的空间推理能力。

Method: 创建包含全新真实世界图像-文本对的基准数据集，设计专门测试相对空间理解和物体顺序的任务，进行解耦分析分离物体定位和空间推理的贡献。

Result: 发现当前VLM模型在空间关系理解方面表现很差，而推理模型表现较好；性能瓶颈主要在于空间推理能力而非物体定位能力。

Conclusion: 空间关系理解是VLM模型的重要短板，需要专门改进；RocketScience基准为评估和改进模型的空间推理能力提供了有效工具，数据集以CC-BY-4.0许可证开源发布。

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.
  We release the dataset with a CC-BY-4.0 license and make the evaluation code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的基于踪迹条的数据集ITD，用于测试时适配(TTA)方法的性能。该数据集模拟了现实世界中带有时序依赖性的挑战，并发现现有TTA方法在处理时序依赖性时存在限制，从而提出了一种对抗性内存初始化策略来改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的TTA测试数据集主要关注分布偏移和i.i.d.假设违反，但缺乏对现实世界中自然存在的时序依赖性（如视频流中连续帧的相似性）的模拟。这个缺陷导致对TTA方法在真实场景下性能的评估不准确。

Method: 通过从物体跟踪数据集的边界框中收集序列化的物体中心图像来构建ITD数据集，使其自然体现时间依赖性。并且提出了一种新的对抗性内存初始化策略来改善基于内存的TTA方法的性能。

Result: 对现有TTA方法在ITD数据集上进行了详细实验分析，发现这些方法在面对时序依赖性挑战时存在显著限制。提出的对抗性内存初始化策略在多种方法上都实现了性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: ITD数据集有效地模拟了现实世界中的时序依赖性挑战，为TTA方法提供了更加诚实的测试环境。研究结果显示，对抗性内存初始化策略能够实现显著的性能改善，为处理时序依赖性的TTA方法开启了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

traditional subjective interpretation by providing a data-driven, quantitative
framework for studying the correlations between palmar morphology and
externally validated traits or conditions. The methodology demonstrates
feasibility for applications in digital anthropometry and personalized user
analytics, with potential for deployment on mobile platforms. Results indicate
that machine learning models can identify complex patterns in palm data,
opening avenues for research that intersects cultural practices with

Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying
mechanisms remain unclear, leading to uncertain treatment outcomes. To address
the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and
spatial mismatches, this paper proposes an Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid
Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module that facilitates multimodal integration
by exploiting the advantages of difference convolution in texture extraction
and grayscale invariance, and a Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network
(FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment. Experiments on the MMCSD dataset
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction accuracy of
postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation
studies further confirm its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有深度学习人群计数方法在复杂场景中面临密度分布差异大和视角变化导致的个体表示不一致问题，限制了计数精度。

Method: 提出DSGC-Net双流图卷积网络，包含密度近似(DA)分支和表示近似(RA)分支，分别构建密度驱动和表示驱动的语义图，通过图卷积建模潜在语义关系。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上实验表明优于当前最优方法，在ShanghaiTech Part A和Part B数据集上分别达到MAE 48.9和5.9。

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过挖掘特征相关性有效提升了模型对密度变化和视角姿态变化的适应能力，显著提高了人群计数精度。

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-OOD是一个针对遥感图像的少样本OOD检测框架，通过空间特征增强、双提示对齐机制和置信度引导的自训练循环，显著提升了遥感场景中的异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法主要针对自然图像设计，不适用于遥感图像的数据稀缺性、复杂多尺度场景结构和显著分布偏移等挑战，需要专门的遥感图像OOD检测解决方案。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：1）空间特征增强提升场景判别能力；2）双提示对齐机制交叉验证场景上下文与细粒度语义的空间语义一致性；3）置信度引导的自训练循环动态挖掘伪标签扩展训练数据。

Result: RS-OOD在多个遥感基准测试中持续优于现有方法，能够以最少标注数据实现高效适应。

Conclusion: 空间语义集成对于遥感图像OOD检测具有关键价值，该框架为遥感应用中的可靠异常模式识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督策略有效提升了预测精度，解决了真实世界变异性，弥合了sim-to-real域差距

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Result: 方法显著提升了空间准确性：在FLUX.1-dev上从0.20提升到0.61，在SD2.1上从0.07提升到0.54。同时能够泛化到多种空间关系并显著提高准确性

Conclusion: 通过直接从模型内部表示学习空间关系目标，而不是手工设计损失函数，能够有效改善文本到图像生成模型的空间推理能力，该方法具有很好的泛化性和实用性

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出ORDAC方法，通过标签分布学习自适应校正序数分类中的噪声标签，在年龄估计和疾病严重程度检测任务上显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序数图像分类中标签边界模糊，标注过程容易产生噪声标签，这会显著降低机器学习模型的性能和可靠性

Method: 提出ORDAC方法，利用标签分布学习(LDL)建模序数标签的模糊性和不确定性，在训练过程中动态调整每个样本标签分布的均值和标准差，校正而非丢弃噪声样本

Result: 在Adience数据集上，40%噪声情况下ORDAC_R将平均绝对误差从0.86降至0.62，召回率从0.37提升至0.49，在原始数据集的内在噪声校正上也表现出色

Conclusion: 使用标签分布进行自适应标签校正是提升序数分类模型在噪声数据下鲁棒性和准确性的有效策略

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以实现满意的空间理解性能，需要通过架构设计和推理注入来优化空间理解能力，为改进MLLMs的空间推理能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

TL;DR: MedDINOv3是一个将DINOv3视觉基础模型适配到医学图像分割的框架，通过多尺度token聚合架构和CT-3M数据集上的领域自适应预训练，在多个分割基准测试中达到或超越最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学CT和MRI扫描中器官和肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习模型缺乏跨模态和跨机构的泛化能力。视觉基础模型虽然提供强大可迁移表示，但在医学图像分割中仍面临ViT骨干网络性能不如专用CNN以及自然图像与医学图像领域差异大的挑战。

Method: 首先重新设计简单有效的多尺度token聚合架构，然后在包含387万张轴向CT切片的CT-3M数据集上使用多阶段DINOv3配方进行领域自适应预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征。

Result: MedDINOv3在四个分割基准测试中达到或超越了最先进的性能，证明了视觉基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干网络的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过适当的架构设计和领域自适应预训练，视觉基础模型可以成功适配到医学图像分割任务，为解决模型泛化问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Motivation: 现有高性能实时立体匹配方法依赖3D成本体积正则化，不利于移动设备部署；而基于2D正则化的方法在不适定区域表现不佳。

Method: 设计轻量级双向几何聚合块，分别捕获空间和视差表示，通过解耦学习实现4D成本体积的有效处理。

Result: 在推理时间和准确性方面均优于所有现有基于聚合的方法，甚至超越了基于迭代的方法IGEV-Stereo。

Conclusion: 打破了使用3D卷积处理4D成本体积的经验设计，为解耦聚合范式提供了简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a
simple yet strong baseline of the proposed decouple aggregation paradigm for
further study. Code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出GSD-Net网络，通过几何和结构双重引导机制提升医学图像分割在噪声标注下的鲁棒性，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大规模高质量标注，但专家标注存在主观性和粗糙标注等噪声问题，影响模型性能。需要解决噪声标注对特征学习的干扰。

Method: 提出几何-结构双引导网络(GSD-Net)，包含几何距离感知模块动态调整像素级权重，结构引导标签细化模块利用结构先验优化标签，以及知识迁移模块增强监督和对局部细节的敏感性。

Result: 在6个公开数据集上评估，包含3种模拟噪声和真实多专家标注。在Kvasir提升2.52%，Shenzhen提升22.76%，BU-SUC提升8.87%，BraTS2020提升4.59%（SR模拟噪声下）。

Conclusion: GSD-Net能有效处理医学图像分割中的噪声标注问题，通过几何和结构双重引导机制显著提升模型在噪声环境下的性能表现。

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of
this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/GSD-Net.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外与可见光图像融合在场景感知中至关重要，但现有方法难以在轻量级模型下实现高质量融合，需要新的方法来平衡知识传递和学生自主学习能力。

Method: 采用强化学习驱动的协作蒸馏框架，智能体根据学生性能和师生差距生成挑战性样本供学生自学习，同时动态调整教师指导强度以优化知识转移。

Conclusion: 所提出的强化学习驱动框架有效解决了轻量级模型高质量图像融合的挑战，通过协作蒸馏和自学习的结合实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

TL;DR: 一种新的实时虚拟化妆试用框架，通过透明化妆面具提取和渲染分离的方法，实现了高保真度、身份保持且时间一致的美妆效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在实时化妆转移中存在身份偏移、不公平问题以及缺乏时间一致性，限制了实际应用

Method: 将化妆转移解耦为两步：透明化妆面具提取和图形渲染，使用伪真实数据训练模型，包括图形渲染流水线和无监督k-means聚类方法，采用专门的训练目标如alpha权重重建和唇彩损失

Result: 方法在多样化的姿势、表情和肤色情况下都能实现稳健的化妆转移，保持时间平滑性，在细节捕捉、时间稳定性和身份保持方面超过现有基准方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的两步解耦方法和专门的训练技术，最终实现了高保真度、实时性和时间一致性的虚拟化妆试用效果

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Motivation: 现有低分辨率卫星数据难以准确监测狭窄或泥沙含量高的河流，限制了精细尺度的地表水动态监测能力。

Method: 通过计算机科学与水文学专家合作，开发包含1145张高分辨率图像的数据集，进行超过100小时的人工标注，并与Sentinel-2、SWOT等传感器数据配准，评估多种深度学习架构和预训练策略。

Conclusion: RiverScope为精细尺度和多传感器水文建模提供了宝贵资源，支持气候适应和可持续水资源管理。

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Conclusion: 该方法成功自动化了视频合成过程，通过创新的DiT架构和训练策略，实现了高质量的视频合成效果，为视频制作提供了更高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，用于解决医学影像中传统位置编码在处理各向异性高维图像时的局限性，在多个医学影像任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中复杂的器官形状和各向异性的高维图像特性使得传统位置编码方法(如正弦位置编码和各向同性傅里叶特征编码)表现不佳，需要专门针对医学影像特点设计位置编码方案。

Method: 提出了各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，这是对各向同性傅里叶特征编码的泛化，能够整合各向异性、类别特定和领域特定的空间依赖关系。

Result: 在胸部X光多标签分类、CT器官分类和超声心动图射血分数回归等任务中，AFPE在所有测试的各向异性设置中都显著优于最先进的位置编码方法。

Conclusion: 在各向异性的医学图像和视频中，选择适合数据结构和目标形状的各向异性位置编码至关重要，AFPE为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Conclusion: 所提出的MixMFL范式和MDM-MixMFL框架为分布式混合模态医疗图像分割提供了有效的解决方案，能够处理复杂的模态和数据异质性挑战

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR证明了即使概念简单，完全无监督的方法也能在多目标发现任务中实现卓越性能，解决了现有方法对监督的依赖问题

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Motivation: 现有的3D视觉基础模型在处理长序列图像输入时存在推理效率低下的问题，特别是在VGGT模型中发现了token崩溃现象和计算冗余，需要一种有效的加速方法。

Method: 提出了FastVGGT方法，首次在3D领域应用token合并技术，设计了专门针对3D架构和任务的token分区策略，通过训练无关的机制来加速VGGT模型。

Result: 在多个3D几何基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，在1000张输入图像的情况下实现了4倍加速，同时减轻了长序列场景中的误差累积问题。

Conclusion: token合并技术为可扩展的3D视觉系统提供了一个有前景的解决方案，能够在保持重建能力的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

### [214] [Playing Markov Games Without Observing Payoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00179)
*Daniel Ablin,Alon Cohen*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了零和对称马尔可夫博弈的新框架，在无法观察收益的情况下，仅通过观察对手动作序列就能与完全了解游戏的对手竞争，将在线学习与对抗性博弈论联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Feldman等人关于对称双人矩阵博弈的研究，将对称性概念从矩阵博弈推广到马尔可夫设置，探索在严重信息劣势下的鲁棒学习可能性。

Method: 形式化了三种不同的对称性概念，将学习问题转化为在线学习实例，设计了适用于矩阵和马尔可夫博弈的多项式时间算法。

Result: 证明在已知转移动态且仅观察对手动作序列的条件下，玩家可以渐近匹配对手的回报，即使对手完全了解游戏。

Conclusion: 拓宽了在严重信息劣势下可能实现鲁棒学习的游戏类别，深化了在线学习与对抗性博弈论之间的联系。

Abstract: Optimization under uncertainty is a fundamental problem in learning and
decision-making, particularly in multi-agent systems. Previously, Feldman,
Kalai, and Tennenholtz [2010] demonstrated the ability to efficiently compete
in repeated symmetric two-player matrix games without observing payoffs, as
long as the opponents actions are observed. In this paper, we introduce and
formalize a new class of zero-sum symmetric Markov games, which extends the
notion of symmetry from matrix games to the Markovian setting. We show that
even without observing payoffs, a player who knows the transition dynamics and
observes only the opponents sequence of actions can still compete against an
adversary who may have complete knowledge of the game. We formalize three
distinct notions of symmetry in this setting and show that, under these
conditions, the learning problem can be reduced to an instance of online
learning, enabling the player to asymptotically match the return of the
opponent despite lacking payoff observations. Our algorithms apply to both
matrix and Markov games, and run in polynomial time with respect to the size of
the game and the number of episodes. Our work broadens the class of games in
which robust learning is possible under severe informational disadvantage and
deepens the connection between online learning and adversarial game theory.

### [215] [Strategyproof Mechanisms for Facility Location with Prediction Under the Maximum Cost Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00439)

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究基于学习增强框架的设施选址机制设计问题，提出策略证明机制来利用不完美预测优化最大成本，并分析了在一维和二维空间中的近似保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在设施选址问题中，传统机制设计往往无法充分利用预测信息。本文旨在设计能够利用不完美预测的策略证明机制，在预测准确时获得更好性能，同时在预测错误时仍保持鲁棒性。

Method: 提出MinMaxP机制：当预测位置位于两个极端代理位置之间时返回预测位置，否则返回最接近预测的代理位置。在一维实数线上分析该机制，并在二维lp度量空间中分析坐标独立运行MinMaxP的确定性机制和随机选择机制。

Result: 在一维情况下，MinMaxP机制达到(1+min(1,η))-近似，且证明没有其他确定性策略证明机制能获得更好的近似保证。在二维空间中分析了坐标独立机制和随机机制的近似性能。

Conclusion: MinMaxP机制在一维设施选址问题中是最优的确定性策略证明机制，能够有效利用预测信息平衡一致性和鲁棒性。二维扩展机制也展示了良好的性能特征，为学习增强机制设计提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study the mechanism design problem of facility location on a metric space
in the learning-augmented framework, where mechanisms have access to an
imperfect prediction of optimal facility locations. Our goal is to design
strategyproof (SP) mechanisms to elicit agent preferences on the facility
locations truthfully and, leveraging the given imperfect prediction, determine
the facility location that approximately minimizes the maximum cost among all
agents. In particular, we seek SP mechanisms whose approximation guarantees
depend on the prediction errors -- achieve improved guarantees when the
prediction is accurate (known as the \emph{consistency}), while still ensuring
robust worst-case performance when the prediction is arbitrarily inaccurate
(known as the \emph{robustness}).
  When the metric space is the real line, we characterize all deterministic SP
mechanisms with consistency strictly less than 2 and bounded robustness: such
mechanisms must be the MinMaxP mechanism, which returns the prediction location
if it lies between the two extreme agent locations and, otherwise, returns the
closest agent location to the prediction. We further show that, for any
prediction error $\eta\ge 0$, while MinMaxP is $(1+\min(1,
\eta))$-approximation, no deterministic SP mechanism can achieve a better
approximation. In two-dimensional spaces with the $l_p$ metric, we analyze the
approximation guarantees of a deterministic mechanism that runs MinMaxP
independently on each coordinate, as well as a randomized mechanism that
selects between two deterministic ones with specific probabilities. Finally, we
discuss the group strategyproofness of the considered mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散竞价博弈在实际应用中具有重要意义（如必须以分为单位出价），但之前的研究主要集中在连续竞价博弈。本文首次系统研究离散竞价博弈中的均值收益和能量目标问题。

Method: 研究离散竞价博弈模型，玩家在图上通过有限精度的竞价移动令牌。建立阈值预算的理论框架，分析阈值结构特征，并设计紧凑策略。

Result: 证明了离散竞价博弈中阈值预算的存在性（非平凡性质），识别了阈值的结构特征，证明了即使在简洁表示的游戏中，阈值计算也在NP和coNP复杂度类中。

Conclusion: 离散竞价博弈具有与连续情况不同的数学结构，阈值预算的存在性和结构分析为实际应用中的策略设计提供了理论基础，复杂度结果表明该问题是可处理的。

Abstract: A \emph{bidding} game is played on a graph as follows. A token is placed on
an initial vertex and both players are allocated budgets. In each turn, the
players simultaneously submit bids that do not exceed their available budgets,
the higher bidder moves the token, and pays the bid to the lower bidder. We
focus on \emph{discrete}-bidding, which are motivated by practical applications
and restrict the granularity of the players' bids, e.g, bids must be given in
cents. We study, for the first time, discrete-bidding games with {\em
mean-payoff} and {\em energy} objectives. In contrast, mean-payoff {\em
continuous}-bidding games (i.e., no granularity restrictions) are understood
and exhibit a rich mathematical structure. The {\em threshold} budget is a
necessary and sufficient initial budget for winning an energy game or
guaranteeing a target payoff in a mean-payoff game. We first establish
existence of threshold budgets; a non-trivial property due to the concurrent
moves of the players. Moreover, we identify the structure of the thresholds,
which is key in obtaining compact strategies, and in turn, showing that finding
threshold is in \NP~and \coNP even in succinctly-represented games.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出两种量子博弈模型QG-U1和QG-G4，用于自动驾驶中的交互感知决策，通过量子力学原理改进传统博弈论，在合并和环岛场景中表现出更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动驾驶决策方法往往忽视或过度简化车辆间交互，导致自我车辆行为过于保守，需要新的交互感知决策模型。

Method: 开发了QG-U1和QG-G4两种量子博弈模型，基于量子力学原理（叠加、干涉、纠缠），适用于双玩家双策略游戏，可在标准计算机上实时运行。

Result: QG-G4相比基线方法实现了更低的碰撞率和更高的成功率，两种量子模型在特定参数设置下比经典博弈方法获得更高的期望收益。

Conclusion: 量子博弈模型为自动驾驶交互决策提供了有效解决方案，无需量子硬件即可实现性能提升，展现了量子计算原理在经典计算环境中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Decision-making in automated driving must consider interactions with
surrounding agents to be effective. However, traditional methods often neglect
or oversimplify these interactions because they are difficult to model and
solve, which can lead to overly conservative behavior of the ego vehicle. To
address this gap, we propose two quantum game models, QG-U1 (Quantum Game -
Unitary 1) and QG-G4 (Quantum Game - Gates 4), for interaction-aware
decision-making. These models extend classical game theory by incorporating
principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, interference, and
entanglement. Specifically, QG-U1 and QG-G4 are designed for two-player games
with two strategies per player and can be executed in real time on a standard
computer without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate both models in merging
and roundabout scenarios and compare them with classical game-theoretic methods
and baseline approaches (IDM, MOBIL, and a utility-based technique). Results
show that QG-G4 achieves lower collision rates and higher success rates
compared to baseline methods, while both quantum models yield higher expected
payoffs than classical game approaches under certain parameter settings.

Motivation: 安全均衡是纳什均衡的一个有前景的细化概念，其中玩家不仅关注自身收益最大化，还关注降低其他玩家的收益。研究安全均衡在约束条件下的存在性判定问题具有重要意义

Method: 基于有限有向图上的多人非零和回合制游戏模型，分析安全均衡在给定收益约束条件下的存在性判定问题

Result: 讨论了安全均衡存在性判定问题的可判定性和计算复杂度

Conclusion: 该研究为多人非零和游戏中的安全均衡理论提供了重要的可计算性分析，对博弈论和形式化验证领域有重要贡献

Abstract: We consider a multi-player non-zero-sum turn-based game (abbreviated as
multi-player game) on a finite directed graph. A secure equilibrium (SE) is a
strategy profile in which no player has the incentive to deviate from the
strategy because no player can increase her own payoff or lower the payoff of
another player. SE is a promising refinement of Nash equilibrium in which a
player does not care the payoff of another player. In this paper, we discuss
the decidability and complexity of the problem of deciding whether a secure
equilibrium with constraints (a payoff profile specifying which players must
win) exists for a given multi-player game.

TL;DR: 本文通过博弈论分析研究了在线内容平台的两种进入壁垒：结构性壁垒（由现有内容提供者集体行为形成）和战略性壁垒（平台主动设置进入费用），证明了结合进入费用和奖励机制可以提升内容质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台低质量内容泛滥往往源于缺乏有意义的进入门槛，这促使研究者探索隐性和显性进入壁垒以及相应奖励机制是否能提升内容质量。

Method: 采用博弈论分析方法，研究两种进入壁垒：1）结构性壁垒 - 由现有内容提供者集体行为形成的自然壁垒；2）战略性壁垒 - 平台主动设置的进入费用机制。分析了等级排序和按比例分配两种奖励机制。

Result: 研究证明：两种奖励机制在纳什均衡下都会产生结构性壁垒；平台通过将部分或全部进入费用重新注入奖励池的战略性壁垒方法，能够有效提升整体内容质量。

Conclusion: 研究为设计结合进入费用和奖励机制的方案提供了理论基础，有助于促进更高质量内容和更健康的在线生态系统。

Abstract: The prevalence of low-quality content on online platforms is often attributed
to the absence of meaningful entry requirements. This motivates us to
investigate whether implicit or explicit entry barriers, alongside appropriate
reward mechanisms, can enhance content quality. We present the first
game-theoretic analysis of two distinct types of entry barriers in online
content platforms. The first, a structural barrier, emerges from the collective
behaviour of incumbent content providers which disadvantages new entrants. We
show that both rank-order and proportional-share reward mechanisms induce such
a structural barrier at Nash equilibrium. The second, a strategic barrier,
involves the platform proactively imposing entry fees to discourage
participation from low-quality contributors. We consider a scheme in which the
platform redirects some or all of the entry fees into the reward pool. We
formally demonstrate that this approach can improve overall content quality.
Our findings establish a theoretical foundation for designing reward mechanisms
coupled with entry fees to promote higher-quality content and support healthier
online ecosystems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了第一个组合且强多项式时间算法来计算凸博弈中的核仁，解决了先前方法的缺陷并利用了最小核多面体结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核仁是合作博弈论中的核心解概念，但计算通常是NP难的。在凸博弈中，现有的多项式时间算法依赖于椭球法，需要更高效的组合算法。

Method: 重新审视简化博弈方法，开发新的算法思想，利用最小核多面体的结构特征，构建有效的简化博弈计算框架。

Result: 成功实现了第一个组合且强多项式时间的核仁计算算法，推翻了先前关于简化博弈方法无法多项式时间实现的论断。

Conclusion: 通过创新的算法设计和结构分析，证明了简化博弈方法在凸博弈中确实可以有效计算核仁，为相关领域提供了重要的算法突破。

Abstract: The nucleolus is a fundamental solution concept in cooperative game theory,
yet computing it is NP-hard in general. In convex games-where players' marginal
contributions grow with coalition size-the only existing polynomial-time
algorithm relies on the ellipsoid method. We re-examine a reduced game
approach, refuting a previously claimed polynomial-time implementation and
clarifying why it fails. By developing new algorithmic ideas and exploiting the
structure of least core polyhedra, we show that reduced games can in fact be
used effectively. This yields the first combinatorial and strongly polynomial
algorithm for computing the nucleolus in convex games.

Method: 在矩阵博弈和二次高斯博弈框架下，研究信息不对称和信息获取，包括让代理人塑造信念（信息设计）或支付获取信息

Result: 不确定性增加会增加委托人成本，但让代理人塑造其信念可能对委托人有利

Conclusion: 减少信息不对称对委托人有益，信息设计可以成为有效的缓解策略，在特定情况下让代理人参与信念塑造可能带来优势

Abstract: Incentive design deals with interaction between a principal and an agent
where the former can shape the latter's utility through a policy commitment. It
is well known that the principal faces an information rent when dealing with an
agent that has informational advantage. In this work, we embark on a systematic
study of the effect of information asymmetry in incentive design games.
Specifically, we first demonstrate that it is in principal's interest to
decrease this information asymmetry. To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the
principal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka
Information Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all
these cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the
principal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We
study information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games
and quadratic Gaussian game setups.

Motivation: 极化是社会中一个主要问题，通常由极化的政治代表驱动，即使这种情况很容易预防。现有的计算社会选择方法未能有效解决这一问题，因此需要新的方法来评估和避免极化委员会。

Result: 获得了在选民-候选人区间域中的高效算法，分析了与其他目标的兼容性，识别了近似保证之间的权衡，并设计了实现同时常数因子近似的算法。

Conclusion: 通过定义新的量化指标和设计高效算法，该研究为减少社会极化提供了有效的计算社会选择方法，能够在避免极化的同时兼顾其他代表性目标。

Abstract: Polarization is a major concern for a well-functioning society. Often, mass
polarization of a society is driven by polarizing political representation,
even when the latter is easily preventable. The existing computational social
choice methods for the task of committee selection are not designed to address
this issue. We enrich the standard approach to committee selection by defining
two quantitative measures that evaluate how well a given committee
interconnects the voters. Maximizing these measures aims at avoiding polarizing
committees. While the corresponding maximization problems are NP-complete in
general, we obtain efficient algorithms for profiles in the voter-candidate
interval domain. Moreover, we analyze the compatibility of our goals with other
representation objectives, such as excellence, diversity, and proportionality.
We identify trade-offs between approximation guarantees, and describe
algorithms that achieve simultaneous constant-factor approximations.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel curve-based slicing method for generating
planar layers with dynamically varying orientations in digital light processing
(DLP) 3D printing. Our approach effectively addresses key challenges in DLP
printing, such as regions with large overhangs and staircase artifacts, while
preserving its intrinsic advantages of high resolution and fast printing
speeds. We formulate the slicing problem as an optimization task, in which
parametric curves are computed to define both the slicing layers and the model
partitioning through their tangent planes. These curves inherently define
motion trajectories for the build platform and can be optimized to meet
critical manufacturing objectives, including collision-free motion and
floating-free deposition. We validate our method through physical experiments
on a robotic multi-axis DLP printing setup, demonstrating that the optimized
curves can robustly guide smooth, high-quality fabrication of complex
geometries.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型加速方法未能充分利用说话头生成任务特有的时空冗余性，导致推理速度慢，限制了实际应用

Method: 1) Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP)：缓存静态特征，在推理时绕过大多数模型层，并使用缓存特征和估计噪声潜在作为输入实现并行预测；2) Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA)：利用说话头视频的空间解耦特性，将注意力计算限制在动态前景区域，并在某些层移除参考特征以获得额外加速

Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic
videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications.
Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the
temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this
paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies
through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based
Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass
most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using
cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing
sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to
further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in
talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.
Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra
speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了邻近搜索策略配置对后续任务影响研究的空白，为曲线基向量场数据处理提供了重要的方法论指导。

Abstract: Curve-based representations, particularly integral curves, are often used to
represent large-scale computational fluid dynamic simulations. Processing and
analyzing curve-based vector field data sets often involves searching for
neighboring segments given a query point or curve segment. However, because the
original flow behavior may not be fully represented by the set of integral
curves and the input integral curves may not be evenly distributed in space,
popular neighbor search strategies often return skewed and redundant
neighboring segments. Yet, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive
research on how different configurations of neighboring segments returned by
specific neighbor search strategies affect subsequent tasks. To fill this gap,
this study evaluates the performance of two popular neighbor search strategies
combined with different distance metrics on a point-based vector field
reconstruction task and a segment saliency estimation using input integral
curves. A large number of reconstruction tests and saliency calculations are
conducted for the study. To characterize the configurations of neighboring
segments for an effective comparison of different search strategies, a number
of measures, like average neighbor distance and uniformity, are proposed. Our
study leads to a few observations that partially confirm our expectations about
the ideal configurations of a neighborhood while revealing additional findings
that were overlooked by the community.

Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for
text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets
lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason
is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing
signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing
strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the
latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate
3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the
generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization
guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement
step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods
enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes
and semantic manipulations.

Abstract: We present a high-performance system for automatic differentiation (AD) of
functions defined on triangle meshes that exploits the inherent sparsity and
locality of mesh-based energy functions to achieve fast gradient and Hessian
computation on the GPU. Our system is designed around per-element forward-mode
differentiation, enabling all local computations to remain in GPU registers or
shared memory. Unlike reverse-mode approaches that construct and traverse
global computation graphs, our method performs differentiation on the fly,
minimizing memory traffic and avoiding global synchronization. Our programming
model allows users to define local energy terms while the system handles
parallel evaluation, derivative computation, and sparse Hessian assembly. We
benchmark our system on a range of applications--cloth simulation, surface
parameterization, mesh smoothing, and spherical manifold optimization. We
achieve a geometric mean speedup of 6.2x over optimized PyTorch implementations

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于扩散的图像编辑在保持背景相似性、速度效率和内存效率方面的挑战，实现细粒度可控编辑。

Method: 采用自适应潜在融合框架，选择性保留高相似度语义重要区域的源特征，在其他区域根据目标提示生成目标内容，兼容UNet和DiT架构。

Result: 在PIE-Bench数据集上实验表明，LatentEdit在保真度和可编辑性之间达到最佳平衡，在8-15步内超越最先进方法，其无反演变体进一步减少计算量。

Conclusion: LatentEdit提供了一个轻量级即插即用解决方案，显著提升了实时部署效率，在图像编辑任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent
years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing
while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory
efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion
framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference
latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source
features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating
target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables
fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal
model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight,
plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based
architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that
our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and
editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps.
Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural
function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate
variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

TL;DR: IntrinsicReal是一个新的领域自适应框架，通过双伪标签策略将IntrinsicAnything从合成数据域适配到真实世界数据域，显著提升了单张RGB图像反照率估计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在合成数据集上训练，直接应用于真实世界图像时存在领域差距，导致泛化性能不佳。需要解决合成数据与真实数据之间的领域差异问题。

Method: 提出双伪标签策略：1）基于分类器预测的绝对置信度阈值进行伪标签；2）基于分类器预测的相对偏好排序进行伪标签。采用两阶段流水线依次应用这两种技术。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上都取得了最先进的结果，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IntrinsicReal通过创新的双伪标签策略有效解决了合成到真实世界的领域适应问题，为真实环境下的本征图像分解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB
images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset)
presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their
ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)
have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they
remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,
Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the
large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal
generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing
IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the
above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.
Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by
fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual
pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence
threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative
preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This
strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality
outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for
sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become
more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that
sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt
IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our
IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: RealMat是一个基于扩散模型的材料生成器，通过结合合成数据训练和强化学习优化，利用真实材料图像数据集和文本到图像模型的先验知识，生成高质量的真实感材料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有材料生成方法主要基于合成数据训练，存在视觉真实感差距；而基于真实闪光照片的方法又受限于数据规模和多样性。需要一种既能保证真实性又能保持多样性的材料生成方案。

Method: 1. 使用合成材料图在2×2网格上微调预训练的SDXL模型；2. 通过强化学习进一步微调，使用大规模真实材料图像数据集构建真实感奖励函数来优化生成质量。

Result: 该方法相比基线模型和相关工作，显著提高了生成材料的真实感，解决了合成数据训练带来的视觉差距问题。

Conclusion: RealMat通过结合合成数据训练和基于真实图像的强化学习优化，成功实现了高质量真实感材料的生成，为3D内容创作提供了更实用的工具。

Abstract: Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to
make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material
generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides
precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to
create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively,
recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee
realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these
limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that
leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of
realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune
a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged
in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while
learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this
creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We
propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),
encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward
function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a
large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach
increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related
work.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的Transformer模型，通过多头注意力机制近似Hodge矩阵，避免传统方法需要的谱特征分解和复杂预处理，在网格分割和分类任务中实现了高效的计算性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图和网格Transformer模型依赖于谱特征分解操作（如Laplacian矩阵或热核签名）来生成位置嵌入，这些操作计算成本高。需要一种更高效的方法来编码网格结构。

Method: 受离散外微分中Hodge Laplacian算子显式构造的启发，设计了新的深度学习层。通过多头注意力机制近似Hodge矩阵（∗0、∗1、∗2），学习作用于网格顶点、边和面的离散算子家族。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种直接学习的高效Transformer方案，通过近似Hodge矩阵来替代传统的谱特征分解方法，在保持性能的同时大大提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes
for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily
utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based
methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional
embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations,
e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then
concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach
inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in
Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and
exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust
the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the
multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$,
$\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act
on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a
computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in
mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning
framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition
operations or complex preprocessing operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA网格模型分辨率有限，神经体积方法渲染速度慢，现有高斯溅射面部模型依赖网格先验，无法捕捉细粒度几何和全头覆盖。

Method: 在基础3DMM上添加残差几何和外观组件，使用粗粒度解码器生成网格变形，细粒度解码器表示高斯外观，轻量CNN细化渲染图像，保持75FPS实时渲染。

Result: 在单目3D人脸重建、新视角合成和表情迁移任务中，GRMM在保真度和表情准确性方面超越现有方法，同时保持实时交互性能。

Conclusion: GRMM通过残差学习和EXPRESS-50数据集，实现了高保真度、细粒度控制和实时渲染的全头3D面部建模，为AR/VR应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and
expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional
PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism.
Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive
use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,
high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for
expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,
expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head
Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry
and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency
details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM
provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters
(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals
that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's
capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders
represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised
images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.
To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first
dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust
disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across
monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression
transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression
accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.

TL;DR: Think2Sing是一个基于扩散模型和大型语言模型的歌唱驱动3D头部动画框架，通过创新的运动字幕和歌唱思维链推理过程，生成语义一致、时间连贯的精细面部动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音驱动方法在歌唱动画中产生过于简化、情感平淡和语义不一致的结果，无法满足歌唱特有的丰富情感、动态韵律和基于歌词的语义需求。

Method: 提出扩散框架Think2Sing，利用预训练大语言模型，结合歌词和声学条件生成动画。创新引入运动字幕作为辅助语义表示，通过歌唱思维链推理和声学引导检索获得精确时间戳和区域运动描述。将任务构建为运动强度预测问题，实现更精细的面部区域控制。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了歌唱驱动3D头部动画的挑战，通过语义丰富的运动字幕和扩散模型实现了高质量、可控的歌唱面部动画生成。

Abstract: Singing-driven 3D head animation is a challenging yet promising task with
applications in virtual avatars, entertainment, and education. Unlike speech,
singing involves richer emotional nuance, dynamic prosody, and lyric-based
semantics, requiring the synthesis of fine-grained, temporally coherent facial
motion. Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified,
emotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient
for singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a
diffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to
generate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations,
conditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction
of motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a
novel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided
retrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific
motion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task
as a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial
regions and improving the modeling of expressive motion. To support this, we
create a multimodal singing dataset with synchronized video, acoustic
descriptors, and motion subtitles, enabling diverse and expressive motion
learning. Extensive experiments show that Think2Sing outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity,
while also offering flexible, user-controllable animation editing.

Conclusion: 该框架为3D生成领域提供了标准化的评估方法，有助于开发更鲁棒和应用特定的3D生成解决方案，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has
increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established
pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and
fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids,
neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees,
each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a
unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D
representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these
representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency,
and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our
experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D
generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression
with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction
errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to
evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can
inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications,
facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions
in 3D generation. The code for our framework is available at

TL;DR: 提出动态NSGA-II算法，通过动态调整种群大小来加速多目标优化，相比经典NSGA-II获得Θ(n)倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOEAs使用固定大种群存储帕累托最优解会降低算法效率，需要更高效的动态种群管理方法

Method: 基于NSGA-II设计动态种群算法dNSGA-II，从4个解开始，每τ次评估后种群大小翻倍，最大到μ

Result: 数学证明dNSGA-II在OneMinMax问题上以O(n log n)时间复杂度找到完整帕累托前沿，比NSGA-II快Θ(n)倍

Conclusion: 动态种群策略能显著提升多目标进化算法效率，并发运行可进一步优化参数选择

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are among the most widely and
successfully applied optimizers for multi-objective problems. However, to store
many optimal trade-offs (the Pareto optima) at once, MOEAs are typically run
with a large, static population of solution candidates, which can slow down the
algorithm. We propose the dynamic NSGA-II (dNSGA-II), which is based on the
popular NSGA-II and features a non-static population size. The dNSGA-II starts
with a small initial population size of four and doubles it after a
user-specified number $\tau$ of function evaluations, up to a maximum size of
$\mu$. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove that the dNSGA-II with
parameters $\mu \geq 4(n + 1)$ and $\tau \geq \frac{256}{50} e n$ computes the
full Pareto front of the \textsc{OneMinMax} benchmark of size $n$ in
$O(\log(\mu) \tau + \mu \log(n))$ function evaluations, both in expectation and
with high probability. For an optimal choice of $\mu$ and $\tau$, the resulting
$O(n \log(n))$ runtime improves the optimal expected runtime of the classic
NSGA-II by a factor of $\Theta(n)$. In addition, we show that the parameter
$\tau$ can be removed when utilizing concurrent runs of the dNSGA-II. This
approach leads to a mild slow-down by a factor of $O(\log(n))$ compared to an
optimal choice of $\tau$ for the dNSGA-II, which is still a speed-up of
$\Theta(n / \log(n))$ over the classic NSGA-II.

Abstract: Conventional music visualisation systems rely on handcrafted ad hoc
transformations of shapes and colours that offer only limited expressiveness.
We propose two novel pipelines for automatically generating music videos from
any user-specified, vocal or instrumental song using off-the-shelf deep
learning models. Inspired by the manual workflows of music video producers, we
experiment on how well latent feature-based techniques can analyse audio to
detect musical qualities, such as emotional cues and instrumental patterns, and
distil them into textual scene descriptions using a language model. Next, we
employ a generative model to produce the corresponding video clips. To assess
the generated videos, we identify several critical aspects and design and
conduct a preliminary user evaluation that demonstrates storytelling potential,
visual coherency and emotional alignment with the music. Our findings
underscore the potential of latent feature techniques and deep generative
models to expand music visualisation beyond traditional approaches.

however the language of harmony is more structured than general text.
Concretely, given a set of harmonization suggestions for a given musical

harmonization sequence that satisfies the following two key criteria: (1) an
effective representation of the collective suggestions; and (2) an
harmonization that is musically coherent. We present different algorithms for
the aggregation of harmonies given by a group of agents and analyze their
complexities. The results indicate that the Kemeny and plurality-based

Abstract: Rapid advancements in generative modeling have made synthetic audio

Consequently, there is a dire need for robust countermeasures more than ever.
Existing solutions for deepfake detection are often criticized for lacking

TL;DR: BirdDiff是一个生成式框架，通过多尺度自适应鸟鸣增强和条件扩散模型，直接从嘈杂的野外录音中合成高质量的鸟类叫声


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模为生物声学提供了新机遇，可以合成真实的动物叫声来支持生物监测工作，并为濒危物种补充稀缺数据，但直接从嘈杂的野外录音生成鸟类叫声波形仍是一个重大挑战

Method: 提出BirdDiff框架，包含多尺度自适应鸟鸣增强的"零层"阶段，随后是基于三种模态（梅尔频率倒谱系数、物种标签和文本描述）的条件扩散生成器

Result: 在12种野生鸟类数据集上，BirdDiff在信噪比增益（+10.45 dB）和频谱失真（Itakura-Saito距离0.54）方面表现最佳；与DiffWave基线相比，在Fréchet音频距离、Jensen-Shannon散度和分类准确率（从35.9%提升到70.1%）等指标上均有显著改进

Conclusion: BirdDiff能够直接从嘈杂的野外录音中实现高保真、可控的鸟类叫声生成，为生物声学监测和濒危物种保护提供了有效工具

Abstract: Generative modeling offers new opportunities for bioacoustics, enabling the
synthesis of realistic animal vocalizations that could support biomonitoring
efforts and supplement scarce data for endangered species. However, directly
generating bird call waveforms from noisy field recordings remains a major
challenge.
  We propose BirdDiff, a generative framework designed to synthesize bird calls
from a noisy dataset of 12 wild bird species. The model incorporates a "zeroth
layer" stage for multi-scale adaptive bird-call enhancement, followed by a
diffusion-based generator conditioned on three modalities: Mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients, species labels, and textual descriptions. The
enhancement stage improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing
spectral distortion, achieving the highest SNR gain (+10.45 dB) and lowest
Itakura-Saito Distance (0.54) compared to three widely used non-training
enhancement methods.
  We evaluate BirdDiff against a baseline generative model, DiffWave. Our
method yields substantial improvements in generative quality metrics: Fr\'echet
Audio Distance (0.590 to 0.213), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (0.259 to 0.226),
and Number of Statistically-Different Bins (7.33 to 5.58). To assess
species-specific detail preservation, we use a ResNet50 classifier trained on
the original dataset to identify generated samples. Classification accuracy
improves from 35.9% (DiffWave) to 70.1% (BirdDiff), with 8 of 12 species
exceeding 70% accuracy.
  These results demonstrate that BirdDiff enables high-fidelity, controllable
bird call generation directly from noisy field recordings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GAN语音增强模型的优化策略主要关注生成器架构改进或判别器质量评估指标，但忽视了不同场景中丰富的上下文信息

Method: 提出场景感知判别器，能够捕捉场景特定特征并进行频域划分，从而更准确地评估生成器产生的增强语音质量

Result: 在三个代表性模型和两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效适应各种生成器架构，在不同场景下实现进一步的性能提升

Conclusion: 场景感知判别器方法为GAN语音增强提供了新的优化方向，通过利用场景上下文信息显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Generative adversarial network-based models have shown remarkable performance
in the field of speech enhancement. However, the current optimization
strategies for these models predominantly focus on refining the architecture of
the generator or enhancing the quality evaluation metrics of the discriminator.
This approach often overlooks the rich contextual information inherent in
diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a scenario-aware discriminator
that captures scene-specific features and performs frequency-domain division,
thereby enabling a more accurate quality assessment of the enhanced speech
generated by the generator. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three
representative models using two publicly available datasets. The results
demonstrate that our method can effectively adapt to various generator
architectures without altering their structure, thereby unlocking further
performance gains in speech enhancement across different scenarios.

### [245] [The Name-Free Gap: Policy-Aware Stylistic Control in Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00654)
*Ashwin Nagarajan,Hao-Wen Dong*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该研究探索使用大型语言模型生成的人类可读描述符作为政策合规的风格控制替代方案，发现虽然艺术家名称是最强的控制信号，但无名称描述符也能恢复大部分效果，表明现有艺术家名称限制措施可能无法完全防止风格模仿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到音乐模型在细粒度风格控制方面存在挑战，通常需要重新训练或专门的条件设置，这限制了可复现性和政策合规性（当艺术家名称受限时）。研究旨在探索轻量级、人类可读的描述符是否能提供政策鲁棒的风格控制替代方案。

Method: 使用MusicGen-small模型，评估Billie Eilish和Ludovico Einaudi两位艺术家。为每位艺术家使用15个参考片段，在三种条件下评估匹配种子：基线提示、艺术家名称提示和五组描述符。所有提示均使用大型语言模型生成，评估使用VGGish和CLAP嵌入以及分布和逐片段相似性度量。

Result: 结果显示艺术家名称是跨两位艺术家的最强控制信号，但无名称描述符能恢复大部分效果。跨艺术家转移降低了对齐性，表明描述符编码了目标风格线索。研究还提供了十位当代艺术家的描述符表来说明标记的广度。

Conclusion: 研究定义了"无名称差距"概念，即艺术家名称提示与政策合规描述符之间的可控性差异，并通过可复现的评估协议展示了提示级可控性，表明现有安全措施可能无法完全防止风格模仿。

Abstract: Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or
mood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing
stylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning,
which complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist
names are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers
sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for
stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish
(vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use
fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions:
baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts
are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and
CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including
a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the
strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors
recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as
the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully
prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that
descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table
across ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens.
Together these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability
difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown
through a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到音频生成方法虽然能实现基于时间戳的细粒度控制，但声音事件类别受限且仅使用模拟数据训练，导致生成音频质量和在真实数据上的泛化性能有限

Method: 使用grounding模型标注真实音频文本数据集的时间戳来构建时序强化的真实数据，结合现有工作的模拟数据训练模型；采用时间戳矩阵编码时间信息，在粗粒度文本描述基础上提供细粒度时间对齐信息

Result: 实验表明PicoAudio2在时序控制性和音频质量方面表现出优越性能

Conclusion: PicoAudio2通过结合真实和模拟数据训练以及时间戳矩阵编码，显著提升了时序可控文本到音频生成的性能

Abstract: Controllable text-to-audio generation (TTA) has attracted much attention
recently. Although existing works can achieve fine-grained controllability
based on timestamp information, sound event categories are limited to a fixed
set. Moreover, since only simulated data is used for training, the generated
audio quality and generalization performance on real data are limited. To
tackle this issue, we propose PicoAudio2, improving temporal-controllable TTA
via a new data processing pipeline and model architecture. Specifically, we use
a grounding model to annotate event timestamps of real audio-text datasets to
curate temporally-strong real data, in addition to simulation data from
existing works. The model is trained on the combination of real and simulation
data. Moreover, following PicoAudio, we encode timestamp information into a
timestamp matrix to provide extra fine-grained time-aligned information to the
model, on top of the coarse-grained textual description. Experiments show that
PicoAudio2 exhibits superior performance in terms of temporal controllability
and audio quality.

TL;DR: 研究引入AImoclips基准评估文本到音乐生成系统的情感保真度，发现商业系统倾向于生成比预期更愉快的音乐，开源系统则相反，所有系统都表现出向情感中性偏置的倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到音乐生成技术虽然取得了进展，但在情感保真度方面研究不足，需要评估这些系统如何向人类听众传达预期情感。

Method: 选择12种情感意图覆盖效价-唤醒空间的四个象限，使用6个最先进的TTM系统生成1000多个音乐片段，111名参与者在9点李克特量表上评分感知效价和唤醒度。

Result: 商业系统倾向于生成比预期更愉快的音乐，开源系统则相反；高唤醒条件下所有模型的情感传达更准确；所有系统都表现出向情感中性偏置的倾向。

Conclusion: 该基准提供了模型特定情感渲染特征的有价值见解，支持未来开发情感对齐的文本到音乐生成系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music (TTM) generation have enabled controllable
and expressive music creation using natural language prompts. However, the
emotional fidelity of TTM systems remains largely underexplored compared to
human preference or text alignment. In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a
benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human
listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12
emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used
six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of
111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a
9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce
music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend
to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under
high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a
bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective
controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific
emotion rendering characteristics and supports future development of
emotionally aligned TTM systems.

Motivation: 交通拥堵是城市面临的紧迫挑战，需要智能交通系统进行实时管理，而现有的声学车辆速度分类方法在准确性和效率方面存在不足。

Method: 采用双分支BMCNN处理MFCC和小波特征以捕捉互补频率模式，使用注意力增强的DQN自适应选择最少音频帧数并在达到置信度阈值时触发早期决策。

Result: 在IDMT-Traffic和SZUR-Acoustic数据集上分别达到95.99%和92.3%的准确率，通过早期终止实现平均处理速度提升1.63倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和效率之间提供了优越的权衡，适用于异构城市环境中的实时智能交通系统部署。

Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a pressing urban challenge, requiring intelligent
transportation systems for real-time management. We present a hybrid framework
that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning for acoustic vehicle
speed classification. A dual-branch BMCNN processes MFCC and wavelet features
to capture complementary frequency patterns. An attention-enhanced DQN
adaptively selects the minimal number of audio frames and triggers early
decisions once confidence thresholds are reached. Evaluations on IDMT-Traffic
and our SZUR-Acoustic (Suzhou) datasets show 95.99% and 92.3% accuracy, with up
to 1.63x faster average processing via early termination. Compared with A3C,
DDDQN, SA2C, PPO, and TD3, the method provides a superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-off and is suitable for real-time ITS deployment in heterogeneous urban
environments.

Conclusion: 完整的VAD->MFCC->LogNNet流水线可在严格内存和计算限制下实现可靠的设备端语音命令识别，适用于电池供电IoT节点和免提控制接口

Abstract: This paper presents a low-resource speech-command recognizer combining
energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing
classifier. Using four commands from the Speech Commands da-taset downsampled
to 8 kHz, we evaluate four MFCC aggregation schemes and find that adaptive
binning (64-dimensional feature vector) offers the best accuracy-to-compactness
trade-off. The LogNNet classifier with architecture 64:33:9:4 reaches 92.04%
accuracy under speaker-independent evaluation, while requiring significantly
fewer parameters than conventional deep learn-ing models. Hardware
implementation on Arduino Nano 33 IoT (ARM Cor-tex-M0+, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM)
validates the practical feasibility, achieving ~90% real-time recognition
accuracy while consuming only 18 KB RAM (55% utilization). The complete
pipeline (VAD -> MFCC -> LogNNet) thus enables reliable on-device
speech-command recognition under strict memory and compute limits, making it
suitable for battery-powered IoT nodes, wire-less sensor networks, and
hands-free control interfaces.

Abstract: The success of the generative model has gained unprecedented attention in the
music generation area. Transformer-based architectures have set new benchmarks
for model performance. However, their practical adoption is hindered by some
critical challenges: the demand for massive computational resources and
inference time, due to their large number of parameters. These obstacles make
them infeasible to deploy on edge devices, such as smartphones and wearables,
with limited computational resources. In this work, we present TinyMusician, a
lightweight music generation model distilled from MusicGen (a State-of-the-art
music generation model). TinyMusician integrates two innovations: (i)
Stage-mixed Bidirectional and Skewed KL-Divergence and (ii) Adaptive
Mixed-Precision Quantization. The experimental results demonstrate that
TinyMusician retains 93% of the MusicGen-Small performance with 55% less model

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于WavLM的新型统一框架，通过多阶段微调策略和针对性数据增强，同时解决孟加拉语ASR中的方言多样性和环境噪声挑战，在多种噪声条件下显著优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为世界第五大语言，其自动语音识别面临两大挑战：方言多样性巨大和环境噪声普遍。现有的自监督学习模型缺乏明确的噪声处理机制和方言适应策略，严重阻碍了2.7亿使用者的技术可及性。

Method: 基于具有掩码语音去噪预训练目标的WavLM模型，提出专门的多阶段微调策略：首先适应通用领域标准孟加拉语建立语言基础，然后通过针对性数据增强专门化用于噪声鲁棒的方言识别。

Result: 在包含多种孟加拉语方言和广泛模拟噪声条件的综合基准测试中，该框架显著优于包括标准微调wav2vec 2.0和大规模多语言Whisper模型在内的强基线，为该任务建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发其他低资源、高变异语言的实用ASR系统提供了可扩展、有效的蓝图，解决了方言多样性和环境噪声的双重挑战。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for Bengali, the world's fifth most spoken
language, remains a significant challenge, critically hindering technological
accessibility for its over 270 million speakers. This challenge is compounded
by two persistent and intertwined factors: the language's vast dialectal
diversity and the prevalence of acoustic noise in real-world environments.
While state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models have advanced ASR
for low-resource languages, they often lack explicit mechanisms to handle
environmental noise during pre-training or specialized adaptation strategies
for the complex phonetic and lexical variations across Bengali dialects. This
paper introduces a novel, unified framework designed to address these dual
challenges simultaneously. Our approach is founded on the WavLM model, which is
uniquely pre-trained with a masked speech denoising objective, making it
inherently robust to acoustic distortions. We propose a specialized multi-stage
fine-tuning strategy that first adapts the model to general-domain standard
Bengali to establish a strong linguistic foundation and subsequently
specializes it for noise-robust dialectal recognition through targeted data
augmentation. The framework is rigorously evaluated on a comprehensive
benchmark comprising multiple Bengali dialects under a wide range of simulated
noisy conditions, from clean audio to low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms strong baselines, including standard fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 and the
large-scale multilingual Whisper model. This work establishes a new
state-of-the-art for this task and provides a scalable, effective blueprint for
developing practical ASR systems for other low-resource, high-variation
languages globally.

Result: 在SPRSound 2024和HF Lung V1数据集上验证了方法的有效性，结合呼吸位置信息能够提高异常音的识别能力

Conclusion: 该方法提高了呼吸音检测的灵活性和应用性，为自动化呼吸音诊断提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary
diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is
often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep
learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which
focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory
sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods
typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to
generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn
directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, lim-
iting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally,
the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance
has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph
neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling
variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for
abnormal respi- ratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility
and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound
2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed
approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the
discrimination between abnormal sounds.

Abstract: Separating overlapping speech from multiple speakers is crucial for effective
human-vehicle interaction. This paper proposes CabinSep, a lightweight neural
mask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) speech separation
approach, to reduce speech recognition errors in back-end automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. Our contributions are threefold: First, we utilize
channel information to extract spatial features, which improves the estimation
of speech and noise masks. Second, we employ MVDR during inference, reducing
speech distortion to make it more ASR-friendly. Third, we introduce a data
augmentation method combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses
(IRs), improving speaker localization at zone boundaries and further reducing
speech recognition errors. With a computational complexity of only 0.4 GMACs,
CabinSep achieves a 17.5% relative reduction in speech recognition error rate
in a real-recorded dataset compared to the state-of-the-art DualSep model.

Abstract: Audio Chord Estimation (ACE) holds a pivotal role in music information
research, having garnered attention for over two decades due to its relevance
for music transcription and analysis. Despite notable advancements, challenges
persist in the task, particularly concerning unique characteristics of harmonic
content, which have resulted in existing systems' performances reaching a glass
ceiling. These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying
interpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance
within chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented
compared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a
first contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator
agreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional
binary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric
that reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our
analysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively
capture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these
findings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates
consonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing.
The proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating
root, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord
labels from decomposed outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较传统机器学习方法和深度学习在音乐流派自动分类任务上的性能表现，探讨在数据受限情况下哪种方法更有效

Method: 使用GTZAN数据集，对比基于手工设计音频特征的传统分类器（SVM和集成方法）与基于梅尔频谱图的CNN模型的分类性能

Result: SVM分类器凭借领域特定的特征工程获得了比端到端CNN模型更高的分类准确率

Conclusion: 在中等规模数据集上，传统特征提取方法仍具有实用价值，深度学习的普适性需要根据数据集规模谨慎评估

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine learning methodologies
for automatic music genre classification. We evaluate the performance of
classical classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble
methods, trained on a comprehensive set of hand-crafted audio features, against
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on Mel spectrograms. The study
is conducted on the widely-used GTZAN dataset. Our findings demonstrate a
noteworthy result: the SVM, leveraging domain-specific feature engineering,
achieves superior classification accuracy compared to the end-to-end CNN model.
We attribute this outcome to the data-constrained nature of the benchmark
dataset, where the strong inductive bias of engineered features provides a
regularization effect that mitigates the risk of overfitting inherent in
high-capacity deep learning models. This work underscores the enduring
relevance of traditional feature extraction in practical audio processing tasks
and provides a critical perspective on the universal applicability of deep
learning, especially for moderately sized datasets.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: FireRedTTS-2是一个用于多说话人对话生成的长格式流式TTS系统，通过新的12.5Hz流式语音分词器和双变换器架构，实现了稳定的自然语音、可靠的说话人切换和上下文感知韵律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话生成方法需要完整对话文本才能合成，产生包含所有声音的单一不可分割语音，不适合交互式聊天，且存在合成不稳定、说话人转换不准确和韵律不连贯等问题。

Method: 采用新的12.5Hz流式语音分词器加速训练和推理；使用文本-语音交错格式，按时间顺序连接说话人标记文本和对齐的语音标记；采用双变换器架构：大型仅解码器变换器在第一层预测标记，较小变换器完成后续层。

Result: 实验结果显示FireRedTTS-2能够无缝集成到聊天框架中，通过最小微调即可产生由隐式上下文线索引导的情感表达语音。在播客生成中，在客观可懂度、说话人轮换可靠性和感知自然度方面超越了现有系统。

Conclusion: FireRedTTS-2为多说话人对话生成提供了稳定、自然的流式TTS解决方案，在交互性和语音质量方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Current dialogue generation approaches typically require the complete
dialogue text before synthesis and produce a single, inseparable speech
containing all voices, making them unsuitable for interactive chat; moreover,
they suffer from unstable synthesis, inaccurate speaker transitions, and
incoherent prosody. In this work, we present FireRedTTS-2, a long-form
streaming TTS system for multi-speaker dialogue generation, delivering stable,
natural speech with reliable speaker switching and context-aware prosody. A new
12.5Hz streaming speech tokenizer accelerates training and inference, extends
maximum dialogue length, encodes richer semantics to stabilize text-to-token
modeling and supports high-fidelity streaming generation for real-time
applications. We adopt a text-speech interleaved format, concatenating
speaker-labeled text with aligned speech tokens in chronological order, and
model it with a dual-transformer: a large decoder-only transformer predicts
tokens at the first layer, and a smaller one completes subsequent layers.
Experimental results show that FireRedTTS-2 integrates seamlessly with chat
frameworks and, with minimal fine-tuning, produces emotionally expressive
speech guided by implicit contextual cues. In podcast generation, it surpasses
existing systems including MoonCast, Zipvoice-Dialogue, and MOSS-TTSD in
objective intelligibility, speaker-turn reliability, and perceived naturalness
with context-consistent prosody. Our demos are available at

*Jiayu Xiong,Jun Xue,Jianlong Kwan,Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了AudioRWKV (A-RWKV)架构，通过给合RWKV7的稳定递归结构和双向WKV核，解决了Transformer计算复杂度高和Mamba稳定性差的问题，在音频建模中实现了高效和稳定的长序列处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在音频建模中O(L^2)计算复杂度问题，以及Mamba架构在扩大参数和数据时稳定性不足的挑战。

Method: 继承RWKV7的稳定递归结构，将1D token-shift操作替换为2D深度分离卷积来捕捉局部谱时模式，并将原始因果WKV核适配为双向WKV核(Bi-WKV)以支持全局上下文建模。

Result: A-RWKV-S (22M)在线性模型体系下达到了与AuM-B (92M)相当的性能，向量通过能力比AST更稳定；在长形式音频(~5分28秒)处理中实现了13.3倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: A-RWKV提供了一种高效、稳定且可扩缩的音频建模方案，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时能够有效处理长序列音频数据。

Abstract: Recently, Transformers (e.g., Audio Spectrogram Transformers, AST) and
state-space models (e.g., Audio Mamba, AuM) have achieved remarkable progress
in audio modeling. However, the O(L^2) computational complexity of the
Transformer architecture hinders efficient long-sequence processing, while the
Mamba architecture tends to become unstable when scaling parameters and data.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes AudioRWKV (A-RWKV), a highly
efficient and stable architecture for audio modeling. Specifically, we inherit
the stable and efficient recurrent formulation of RWKV7 and replace its 1D
token-shift operation with a 2D depthwise separable convolution to better
capture local spectro-temporal patterns. Furthermore, we adapt the original
causal WKV kernel into a bidirectional WKV kernel (Bi-WKV), enabling global
context modeling over the entire audio sequence while maintaining linear
computational complexity. Benefiting from the inherent stability of the RWKV7
foundation, A-RWKV scales seamlessly to larger model sizes. Experimental
results demonstrate that, under the same linear-model regime, A-RWKV-S (22M)
achieves performance parity with AuM-B (92M) while exhibiting more stable
throughput than AST; for long-form audio (~5 minutes 28 seconds), WKV7 achieves
up to a 13.3X speedup in processing.

<details>

Motivation: 挑战传统神经语音编解码器需要复杂残差向量量化(RVQ)堆栈的设计，寻求更简单、低延迟的架构

Method: 将mel频谱图视为2D数据，对非重叠4x4块进行单阶段量化到共享码本，采用VQ-VAE对抗微调和HiFi-GAN声码器

Result: 在7.5kbps码率下，通过STOI、PESQ、MCD、ViSQOL等指标评估，显示与最先进神经编解码器相当的感知质量和可懂度

Conclusion: 简化的非残差架构可作为未来低延迟编解码器设计的有效开放基础

Abstract: We present a neural speech codec that challenges the need for complex
residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks by introducing a simpler,
single-stage quantization approach. Our method operates directly on the
mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4
patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the
architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid.
To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial
fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the
codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for
16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural
codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results
demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive
perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open
foundation for future low-latency codec designs.

Motivation: 探索预训练语音模型在非语音数据（婴儿哭声）上的适用性，以及这些表征编码的具体声学特性，目前这方面研究还很缺乏。

Method: 评估5个预训练语音模型在8个婴儿哭声数据集（115小时音频，960个婴儿）上的表现，分析各模型在所有可用分类任务中的潜在表征。

Result: 预训练语音模型的潜在表征能有效分类人类婴儿哭声，编码了声音源不稳定性和婴儿身份的关键信息。

Conclusion: 不同架构和训练策略的比较为未来针对类似任务（如情感检测）的模型设计提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Transfer learning using latent representations from pre-trained speech models
achieves outstanding performance in tasks where labeled data is scarce.
However, their applicability to non-speech data and the specific acoustic
properties encoded in these representations remain largely unexplored. In this
study, we investigate both aspects. We evaluate five pre-trained speech models
on eight baby cries datasets, encompassing 115 hours of audio from 960 babies.
For each dataset, we assess the latent representations of each model across all
available classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that the latent
representations of these models can effectively classify human baby cries and
encode key information related to vocal source instability and identity of the
crying baby. In addition, a comparison of the architectures and training
strategies of these models offers valuable insights for the design of future
models tailored to similar tasks, such as emotion detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在语音和音乐应用中广泛使用，但缺乏对音频token的合适定义和公平全面的评估方法，阻碍了不同编解码器之间的比较

Method: 提供了语义token和声学token的合适定义，引入了包含四个维度的系统性评估框架：音频重建指标、码本索引稳定性、仅解码器transformer困惑度、下游探测任务性能

Result: 验证了所提供定义的合理性，并揭示了重建指标、码本索引稳定性、下游任务性能和困惑度之间的相关性

Conclusion: 提出的定义和评估框架为音频tokenization提供了标准化方法，有助于更公平全面地比较不同音频编解码器的性能

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied in speech
and music. This tendency has led to a focus on audio tokenization for Large
Models (LMs). Unlike semantic-only text tokens, audio tokens must both capture
global semantic content and preserve fine-grained acoustic details. Moreover,
they provide a discrete method for speech and music that can be effectively
integrated into MLLMs. However, existing research is unsuitable in the
definitions of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In addition, the evaluation
of different codecs typically concentrates on specific domains or tasks, such
as reconstruction or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, which prevents
fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address these problems, this paper
provides suitable definitions for semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a
systematic evaluation framework. This framework allows for a comprehensive
assessment of codecs' capabilities which evaluate across four dimensions: audio
reconstruction metric, codebook index (ID) stability, decoder-only transformer
perplexity, and performance on downstream probe tasks. Our results show the
correctness of the provided suitable definitions and the correlation among
reconstruction metrics, codebook ID stability, downstream probe tasks and
perplexity.

Result: 在DCASE 2020 Task 2数据集上提高了异常检测性能

Conclusion: 验证了所提方法的有效性，为工业设备异常声音检测提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The core challenge in industrial equipment anoma lous sound detection (ASD)
lies in modeling the time-frequency coupling characteristics of acoustic
features. Existing modeling methods are limited by local receptive fields,
making it difficult to capture long-range temporal patterns and cross-band
dynamic coupling effects in machine acoustic features. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, ESTM, which is based on a dual-path Mamba
architecture with time-frequency decoupled modeling and utilizes Selective
State-Space Models (SSM) for long-range sequence modeling. ESTM extracts rich
feature representations from different time segments and frequency bands by
fusing enhanced Mel spectrograms and raw audio features, while further
improving sensitivity to anomalous patterns through the TriStat-Gating (TSG)
module. Our experiments demonstrate that ESTM improves anomalous detection
performance on the DCASE 2020 Task 2 dataset, further validating the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的全双工对话模型FLM-Audio，通过"自然"独白和双重训练方法解决了音频流与文本对齐的挑战，实现了更好的响应速度和对话体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的全双工对话模型在文本独白与音频流对齐方面遇到挑战，字符级对齐方法会降低大型预训练模型的语言能力，且需要高精度的时间戳，导致累积错误和高处理成本。

Method: 提出"自然"独白概念，模仿人类认知行为。采用双重训练范式，在不同训练阶段交替将自然独白放置在音频前后不同位置，构建了7B台览对话模型FLM-Audio。

Result: 实验结果证明FLM-Audio模型在响应速度、双工能力和聊天体验方面都表现出优异的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的方法来解决全双工对话模型中的对齐问题，"自然"独白和双重训练方法显著提升了模型的实时性和用户体验。

Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models are designed to listen and speak simultaneously
with rapid responses to fast-changing user input. Among existing approaches,
native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in
a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to
time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet,
a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that
operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level
alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained
models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which
introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper,
we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural"
monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal
alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or
trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training
paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog
model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting
experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.

Abstract: Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for
adaptive enterprise budgeting.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据湖训练模型和集中式联邦学习提供了实用的数据泄露防御方案，消融实验和自适应攻击讨论指出了未来研究方向

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Abstract: Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology
nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship
between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a
novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced
5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features
derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained
characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the
5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战互补学习系统理论中语义记忆和情景记忆的二元对立，探索新皮质预测编码模型是否具备情景记忆能力及其与语义记忆的关系。

Method: 构建了一个基于预测编码的新皮质神经网络模型，测试其在自联想记忆任务中的表现，比较不同训练样本数量下的记忆能力。

Result: 模型在少量样本训练时可以回忆具体细节，但会过拟合且泛化能力差；当训练样本增多时，模型失去回忆能力，说明新皮质只能有限地编码个体样本。

Conclusion: 情景记忆可以从语义学习中产生，但新皮质的密集重叠表征只能有限地编码个体样本，这支持了海马体稀疏模式分离表征的必要性，验证了互补学习系统理论的合理性。

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-FloPS是一种无需训练的高效扩散模型采样框架，通过重新参数化采样轨迹和自适应速度分解，在极低函数评估次数（如5次）下显著提升采样质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成性能优异，但迭代采样过程计算昂贵。现有的无训练加速方法受限于底层采样轨迹的低效性，需要更有效的采样策略。

Method: 提出A-FloPS框架：1）将预训练扩散模型的采样轨迹重新参数化为流匹配形式；2）采用自适应速度分解机制，将速度场分解为线性漂移项和残差分量；3）主动抑制残差分量的时间变化，实现高阶积分精度。

Result: 在条件图像生成和文本到图像合成任务中，A-FloPS在样本质量和效率方面均优于最先进的无训练采样器，仅用5次函数评估就能获得显著更低的FID和更清晰、更连贯的图像。

Conclusion: A-FloPS是一个通用有效的解决方案，可用于高质量、低延迟的生成建模，其自适应机制还能改进基于流的原生生成模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

Conclusion: 提出的代理基准为模型融合超参数优化算法的开发和性能比较提供了低成本解决方案

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工神经网络在持续学习中面临灾难性遗忘的挑战，即学习新任务时会丢失先前学到的知识。受人类大脑记忆巩固机制的启发，研究者希望探索内部重放机制在缓解这一问题上的潜力。

Method: 使用CIFAR-100数据集在类增量设置下评估内部重放机制的效果，包括单独使用以及与突触智能(SI)结合使用。通过似然分布、重建误差、轮廓分数和UMAP投影等多种分析方法来研究表征空间的变化。

Result: 内部重放显著减轻了遗忘现象，特别是与SI结合使用时效果更好，但代价是初始任务准确率下降，表明存在记忆稳定性与学习可塑性之间的权衡。分析显示内部重放增加了潜在空间的表征重叠，可能限制了任务特异性分化。

Conclusion: 当前脑启发方法存在局限性，需要在持续学习系统中更好地平衡记忆保持和适应能力，为未来研究方向提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光网络故障管理中严重的类别不平衡问题（正常实例远多于故障案例）是重要挑战，虽然预处理和处理中技术已被广泛研究，但后处理方法尚未充分探索

Method: 使用实验数据集对预处理、处理中和后处理方法进行直接比较，包括阈值调整、随机欠采样、SMOTE过采样、元学习和生成式AI等方法

Result: 故障检测中后处理方法（特别是阈值调整）F1分数提升最高达15.3%；故障识别中GenAI方法性能提升最大达24.2%；不同场景下最优方法不同：有类别重叠且延迟关键时SMOTE最有效，无延迟约束时元学习最佳，低重叠场景下生成式AI方法性能最高且推理时间最短

Conclusion: 不同类别不平衡缓解方法在不同应用场景下各有优势，需要根据具体需求（如延迟要求、类别重叠情况）选择合适的方法，后处理方法和生成式AI方法在特定场景下表现出显著优势

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多层感知机（MLP）只能在单一尺度上操作，缺乏对层级细节（LoD）表示的原生支持，而LoD表示对于高效建模和传输信号（如图像和3D形状）至关重要。

Method: 通过修改MLP架构，在隐藏层附加多个输出分支（称为尾部），使每个隐藏层都能在特定LoD级别上直接接收监督信号，从而实现多尺度建模。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，T-MLP在多种信号表示任务中均优于其他神经LoD基线方法。

Conclusion: T-MLP架构成功扩展了传统MLP的能力，使其能够有效支持多尺度层级细节表示，为信号处理任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Abstract: Conversational AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools

manual effort and speeds up remediation. Our comparative analysis showed that
RoBERTa offers high accuracy (99.6 %) and strong anomaly detection,
outperforming Falcon-7B and DeBERTa, as well as exhibiting better flexibility
than large-scale Mistral-7B on the HDFS dataset from LogHub. User feedback
confirms the chatbot's ease of use and improved understanding of anomalies,
demonstrating the ability of the developed framework to strengthen
cybersecurity workflows.

### [284] [Calibration through the Lens of Indistinguishability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02279)
*Parikshit Gopalan,Lunjia Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文是关于校准(calibration)的综述性研究，探讨了如何定义和衡量预测概率的校准误差，以及这些度量对下游决策者的意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习中概率预测的普及，需要解决如何解释预测概率、如何评估连续概率预测器在离散结果观测世界中的表现这一基础问题。

Method: 采用统一视角，将校准视为预测器假设的世界与真实世界（由自然或贝叶斯最优预测器控制）之间的一种不可区分性形式。

Result: 提出了各种校准度量方法，这些方法量化了特定类别的区分器或统计度量能够区分两个世界的程度。

Conclusion: 校准研究为评估概率预测器提供了理论基础，通过不可区分性框架统一了不同的校准度量方法，对实际决策应用具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

TL;DR: SynCircuit首次尝试使用扩散模型生成功能有效的HDL格式合成电路，解决AI辅助IC设计中电路数据稀缺的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI辅助IC设计方法面临电路数据极度稀缺的瓶颈，特别是在公共领域，这限制了相关AI方法的发展

Method: 提出三步创新框架：1)定制扩散模型生成有向循环图；2)通过约束精炼确保电路有效性；3)使用蒙特卡洛树搜索优化逻辑冗余

Result: 实验结果表明SynCircuit能够生成更真实的合成电路，并提升下游电路设计任务中机器学习模型的性能

Conclusion: 该工作成功解决了电路数据稀缺问题，为AI辅助IC设计提供了有效的合成数据生成方案

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great
potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited,
especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the
generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文将联邦学习建模为战略系统而非单纯优化任务，提出了分析框架来区分真正提升性能的行为与仅针对指标的行为，并提供了实践检查清单和算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的成功依赖于参与者不可见的行为，需要从战略系统角度分析规则和激励机制，以识别真正改善性能的行为与仅针对指标的行为之间的差异。

Method: 引入两个指标分别量化行为激励和集体性能损失，建立分析框架来评估操作选择的影响，包括规则设计、信息披露水平、评估方法和聚合器切换等。

Result: 模拟实验在不同环境中验证了框架预测的模式，提供了可复现的程序，并展示了在现实操作变异性下的稳健应用。

Conclusion: 提出了降低指标博弈激励同时维持和扩展稳定合作的设计原则和操作指南，通过周期性重新校准、随机化和基于连接的警报实现稳健应用。

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

Motivation: 医疗健康领域存在大量异构的患者数据（RPM流数据和EHR数据），导致临床医生面临信息过载的挑战，需要新技术来有效管理和分析这些数据。

Method: 通过生成式AI和大语言模型技术，开发能够自然语言对话的临床应用，增强纵向患者数据的导航能力，并提供临床决策支持。

Result: 研究表明GenAI技术能够有效处理复杂的RPM/EHR数据组合，改善临床工作流程，实现个性化护理，但需要解决数据集成、质量、隐私和安全等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对GenAI技术管理临床医生因RPM/EHR数据复杂性导致信息过载的综述，展示了该技术在医疗健康领域的巨大潜力和应用前景。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), offer powerful capabilities for interpreting the complex data
landscape in healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of
the capabilities, requirements and applications of GenAI for deriving clinical
insights and improving clinical efficiency. We first provide some background on
the forms and sources of patient data, namely real-time Remote Patient
Monitoring (RPM) streams and traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The
sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient
data and provide actionable clinical decision support through natural language
dialogue. We discuss the opportunities this presents for streamlining clinician
workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data
integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核工业对AI/ML应用兴趣增加，但缺乏在运行核反应堆中验证AI/ML工具可行性的研究，特别是在区分网络安全事件和操作异常方面。

Method: 开发多层AI/ML架构，整合信息技术和操作技术数据流，在PUR-1研究堆上进行实验，包含14种系统状态（1正常+13异常）和1380万+多变量数据点，模拟多种网络攻击场景。

Result: AI/ML能够区分正常、异常和网络安全相关事件，即使在拒绝服务攻击等挑战条件下。结合IT和OT数据提高了分类准确性，但在同步和收集方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: AI/ML在核网络安全方面显示出巨大潜力，但需要进一步改进复杂事件区分和多类架构处理能力。

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

*Laksh Patel,Neel Shanbhag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenDataCarto框架通过计算训练样本的难度分数和记忆分数，将数据分为四个象限进行针对性修剪和权重调整，有效减少生成模型对训练数据的记忆泄露，在仅修剪10%数据的情况下将合成测试样本提取成功率降低40%以上，同时验证困惑度仅增加不到0.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成模型存在过拟合和无意记忆罕见训练样本的风险，这些被记忆的样本可能被攻击者提取或夸大基准测试性能，需要一种数据为中心的方法来缓解这种记忆泄露问题。

Method: 提出生成数据制图(GenDataCarto)框架，为每个预训练样本分配难度分数(早期epoch损失)和记忆分数("遗忘事件"频率)，然后将样本划分为四个象限来指导针对性修剪和上下权重调整。

Result: 实证结果显示，GenDataCarto在仅修剪10%数据的情况下，将合成测试样本提取成功率降低40%以上，同时验证困惑度仅增加不到0.5%。理论证明记忆分数在平滑性假设下是经典影响的下界，且降低高记忆热点权重可通过均匀稳定性界限减小泛化差距。

Conclusion: 有原则的数据干预可以显著减轻生成模型的记忆泄露，同时对生成性能的影响极小，证明了数据为中心方法在缓解生成模型隐私风险方面的有效性。

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

TL;DR: 提出了Generative Self-Refinement (GSR)框架，通过并行生成候选答案并进行自我精炼来解决复杂推理问题，在数学基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法如Best-of-N和多数投票依赖于候选答案质量，当所有候选都错误时无法产生正确解，且额外模型选择会增加部署成本。

Method: GSR框架：统一模型并行生成候选答案，然后基于问题和候选答案进行自我精炼合成更优解。采用混合训练管道，联合优化直接解题和精炼候选答案两个互补目标。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中达到最先进性能，学习到的自我精炼技能具有模型无关性，在不同模型规模和分布外推理任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: GSR框架有效提升了LLMs解决复杂多步推理问题的能力，通过自我精炼机制克服了现有方法的局限性，具有很好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 分布式轨迹优化方法ADMM-DDP需要大量调参来平衡局部任务性能和全局协调，手动调参困难且耗时。

Method: 提出L2C框架，使用agent-wise神经网络元学习超参数，通过分布式方式端到端微分ADMM-DDP流程，重用DDP组件加速计算，并截断迭代加速训练。

Result: 在协同空中运输任务中，L2C能在高保真仿真中生成动态可行轨迹，安全重构四旋翼编队，适应不同团队规模和任务条件，梯度计算比现有方法快88%。

Conclusion: L2C提供了一个通用的元学习框架，能够自动适应不同任务和配置，显著提高了分布式轨迹优化的效率和性能。

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巴西通用数据保护法(LGPD)限制教育敏感数据的集中化处理，阻碍了数据挖掘和AI在教育个性化学习和风险学生早期识别中的应用，需要寻找隐私保护的计算解决方案。

Method: 使用联邦学习FedProx算法，在模拟50所学校的环境中训练深度神经网络(DNN)模型，预测巴西基础教育评估系统(SAEB)的学生表现，并与集中式XGBoost模型进行性能对比。

Result: 集中式模型准确率为63.96%，联邦学习模型最高达到61.23%准确率，性能损失仅为2.73%，但提供了强大的隐私保护保障。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是巴西教育背景下构建协作预测模型的可行有效解决方案，能够满足LGPD数据保护要求，在保证隐私的同时实现良好的预测性能。

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust
privacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and
effective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the
Brazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements of the LGPD.

Motivation: 现有LSTM模型虽然通过门控机制处理长期信息，但未能最优地关注特定旧索引或长期信息，且缺乏对权重归一化和门非线性化的充分研究。

Method: 1) 输入重排序方法优先处理特定输入索引；2) 通过监督损失函数选择最佳Lp范数进行权重归一化；3) 使用小型前馈神经网络对门进行非线性化处理。

Result: 在文本分类任务中，所提出的方法相比简单LSTM提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 通过输入重排序、权重归一化和门非线性化三种改进方法，可以有效提升LSTM在文本分类任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

Method: CEAT方法利用子模型间的概率差异自适应分配样本权重，通过校准距离正则化强调预测差异大的样本在其他子模型对抗训练中的重要性

Result: 在广泛采用的数据集上实验表明，CEAT在竞争性EAT方法中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: CEAT是模型无关的方法，可无缝适配各种集成方法，具有灵活的适用性

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

Motivation: 解决简单机器人群体（Ant Robots）在复杂灾难响应环境中由于有限感知、无通信和分散控制导致的群体凝聚和碎片化问题，特别是在时间紧急的救火等场景中需要快速响应。

Method: 提出VariAntNet深度学习模型，包含几何特征提取模块处理无序变长局部观测，使用基于可见性图拉普拉斯矩阵特性的新型可微分多目标损失函数来促进群体凝聚。

Conclusion: 在时间关键的应急响应场景中，VariAntNet提供了速度与群体完整性之间的有效权衡，虽然可能损失部分智能体，但快速响应能力使其更实用。

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

Motivation: 虽然图像和文本的生成数据检测方法已经很多，但表格数据因其异构结构和测试时的未见格式而被忽视，需要专门的检测方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的数据点级Transformer架构，包含表格适配组件，能够处理变量和未见的表格演算法。

Result: 在AUC和准确度上比之前的基线提高了7个百分点，通过表格适配组件还能够再提高7个准确度百分点，显示了更好的稳健性。

Conclusion: 这是首次有力证据表明，在实际条件下检测生成式表格数据不仅可行，而且可以高可靠地完成。

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统STE方法忽视了离散化错误，导致极低位宽量下的准确性下降

Method: 提出PEGE方法，采用对数课程驱动的混合精度替换策略，将QAT形成为预测损失和离散化错误的协同优化问题

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的实验表明PEGE持续超过现有方法，能让低精度模型达到或超过全精度模型的准确性

Conclusion: PEGE为量化训练提供了统一可普遍的框架，有效解决了极低位宽量下的准确性问题

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Motivation: 量子退火在解决NP难组合优化问题方面具有潜力，但面临两个主要挑战：手动将问题转换为QUBO格式的复杂性，以及当前量子硬件的可扩展性限制

Method: 使用大语言模型解析自然语言并自动生成结构化数学表示；集成混合量子经典Benders分解方法，将组合复杂的主问题编译为紧凑QUBO格式，线性结构子问题委托给经典求解器

Conclusion: 该框架建立了经典AI与量子计算的协同计算范式，显著降低了使用门槛，为将量子设备转变为大规模现实世界优化挑战的可访问加速器提供了可行途径

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

Result: 该方法能够更有效地利用模型的表征多样性，提升下游应用的表现力和性能。

Conclusion: 综合利用Transformer模型各层表征的PMA方法在心电图分析中具有明显优势，为基础模型的表征利用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

Motivation: 探索预训练大语言模型在实验化学优化中的潜力，改变传统的黑盒参数空间搜索范式，利用LLM的领域知识来更有效地导航化学参数空间。

Method: 使用六个完全枚举的分类反应数据集（768-5684个实验），对比LLM引导优化与贝叶斯优化和随机采样的性能，并引入拓扑无关的信息理论框架来量化采样多样性。

Result: 前沿LLM在五个单目标数据集上持续匹配或超越贝叶斯优化性能，优势随参数复杂性增加和高性能条件稀缺性（<5%空间）而增强。LLM在所有数据集中保持比贝叶斯优化更高的探索熵。

Conclusion: LLM引导优化在传统方法困难的领域表现出色：需要领域理解而非数学优化的复杂分类空间，预训练领域知识实现了更有效的化学参数空间导航。

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器的人体活动识别存在跨用户变异性问题，传统监督学习方法容易过拟合用户特定模式，现有领域泛化方法常忽略时序依赖或需要不切实际的领域标签。

Method: TPRL-DG将特征提取重构为强化学习驱动的序列决策过程，使用基于Transformer的自回归生成器产生捕获用户不变活动动态的时序token，通过多目标奖励函数优化类别区分和跨用户不变性。

Conclusion: 通过学习鲁棒的用户不变时序模式，TPRL-DG实现了可扩展的人体活动识别系统，推动个性化医疗、自适应健身追踪和情境感知环境的发展。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

Motivation: 解决多体系统数据驱动建模中的高计算成本和有限长期预测精度问题

Method: 提出Flow-Matching神经ODE框架，通过数值微分技术直接监督加速度而非积分状态，采用FFT和有限差分混合方案

Result: 在多个基准测试中（质量-弹簧-阻尼系统、双摆、滑块曲柄、车杆系统）均优于MBD-NODE、LSTM和FCNN等方法

Conclusion: FNODE在精度、泛化能力和计算效率方面表现出色，为多体系统建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural
Networks (FCNN), demonstrating good accuracy, generalization, and computational
efficiency.

Motivation: 边缘设备部署AI代理需要隐私保护和响应速度，但内存限制迫使使用推理能力较差的小型LLM，现有TTS方法在边缘硬件上开销过大

Method: 引入三种协同优化：推测性波束扩展减少系统延迟、非对称多模型内存分配动态平衡内存、动态前缀感知调度最大化KV缓存重用

Conclusion: FlashTTS为边缘设备上的高性能AI代理民主化铺平了道路，实现了即插即用的高效TTS服务

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

Motivation: Transformer的自回归推理存在KV缓存线性增长和O(N^2 d)计算复杂度的问题，限制了其处理超长序列的能力

Method: 基于TLinFormer的TConstFormer架构，采用周期性状态更新机制，在k-1个连续步骤中执行恒定时间计算，仅在第k步执行一次线性时间的全局信息同步

Result: 理论计算和实验结果表明，TConstFormer在长文本推理任务的速度、内存效率和整体性能方面相比基线模型具有压倒性优势

Conclusion: 这一突破为高效和鲁棒的流式语言模型应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数估计方法（如稀疏识别和PINNs）在处理非线性动力学、多物理场相互作用或有限观测时表现不佳，需要一种能够从稀疏测量中准确推断参数场的通用方法。

Method: 采用独立坐标神经网络在物理空间或状态变量中连续表示每个参数场，从系统响应的稀疏测量中推断参数场。

Conclusion: Neptune通过实现可靠且数据高效的参数推断，在工程、医疗保健等领域具有广泛的变革性影响潜力。

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter
estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors
by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor
of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation
capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data
where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter
inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,
healthcare, and beyond.

Abstract: Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.
Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately
configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving
significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies
diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based
approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and
fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent

outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

Result: 在多样化稀疏张量数据集上一致优于专家设计的格式，最高达到2倍加速，几何平均加速比为1.4-1.46倍

Conclusion: ReLATE框架能够自动适应不规则张量形状和数据分布，生成高效的稀疏张量表示，显著提升张量分解性能

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

survey results further indicate greater student engagement with the subject and
their own learning process. These findings highlight the potential of

Conclusion: 连续温度滴渏采样器通过更好的探索策略有效解决了传统逆变采样器的限制，为复杂分布的高效采样提供了新方案。

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available

TL;DR: TabPFN v2在多个表格基准测试中优于基于树的模型，但受限于Transformer的二次计算和内存成本，无法处理超过10K上下文标记。本文提出了一种tiled-block策略，在TabPFN框架内计算注意力，使其能够在标准GPU设置下处理长上下文而无需预处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TabPFN v2因Transformer二次计算和内存成本而无法处理长上下文（超过10K标记）的问题，现有方法依赖上下文压缩（如KNN选择代表性样本），但需要预处理。

Method: 引入tiled-block策略在TabPFN框架内计算注意力，该设计与标准GPU设置兼容，无需任何预处理即可处理长上下文。

Result: 在标准TabArena基准测试中证明了该方法的有效性，使TabPFN能够处理长上下文。

Conclusion: 提出的tiled-block策略成功解决了TabPFN处理长上下文的限制，无需预处理，在标准GPU上实现高效计算。

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

Motivation: 基于隐式反馈的推荐系统存在曝光偏差问题，虽然逆倾向评分(IPS)可以校正这种偏差，但往往存在高方差和不稳定性。

Method: 提出了一个集成IPS加权训练和IPS加权BPR目标的pipeline，并加入倾向正则化(PR)来缓解极端倾向权重带来的方差放大问题。

Result: 在合成数据和MovieLens 100K数据上的实验表明，该方法在无偏曝光下泛化更好，相比朴素和标准IPS方法降低了评估方差。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实推荐场景中的反事实学习和评估提供了实用指导，能够有效处理曝光偏差问题并提高模型稳定性。

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

*An B. Vuong,Michael T. McCann,Javier E. Santos,Yen Ting Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散模型实际上学习的是Wasserstein梯度流的速度场而非真正的分数函数，即使神经网络学到的向量场不是保守的，生成采样仍然有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为扩散模型学习噪声数据的分数函数（对数密度的梯度），但这要求学习目标是保守向量场，而实际使用的神经网络架构并未强制这一约束。研究发现训练好的扩散网络违反了真正分数函数的积分和微分约束。

Method: 通过数值证据展示训练好的扩散网络违反保守性约束，提出从Wasserstein梯度流（WGF）的流速场匹配角度来理解扩散训练，而非基于反向时间随机微分方程的分数学习。

Result: 尽管学习的向量场不是保守的，扩散模型作为生成机制表现优异。非保守的神经网络近似误差不一定损害密度传输，生成采样仍然成功。

Conclusion: WGF视角为理解扩散生成模型提供了原则性、优雅且理论基础坚实的框架，消除了对反向时间SDE理论的依赖，解释了为什么即使神经向量场不是真正分数函数时生成仍然有效。

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了离线RL的泛化问题，通过结合语言模型和扩散模型，为处理多样化设置中的未见任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然PERL方法在数值实验中显示出优于纯神经网络的优势，但这些结果缺乏理论解释和证明，需要从理论层面阐明其优势机制。

Method: 研究具有Lipschitz连续性问题的一般类别，通过分析损失函数边界与残差学习结构之间的关系，严格证明了一系列解释PERL优势的定理。

Result: 理论证明PERL确实具有参数少、收敛快、样本需求低的优势。自动驾驶轨迹预测的数值实验证实，即使训练样本显著减少，PERL仍能比纯神经网络获得更高精度。

Conclusion: PERL方法在提高预测性能的同时减少了数据需求，在真实世界自动驾驶应用中具有重要价值，特别是在难以获取极端案例数据的情况下。

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对ReLU网络的优化正交初始化方法，通过Stiefel流形上的优化问题校准预激活统计量，解决了深度网络中神经元失活和梯度消失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有初始化方法（如He、Xavier、正交初始化）在深度ReLU网络中无法有效调节预激活均值和控制激活稀疏性，导致神经元永久失活（dying ReLU）和梯度不稳定问题。

Method: 在Stiefel流形上求解优化问题，得到专门为ReLU优化的正交初始化方法，推导出闭式解和高效采样方案，从初始化阶段就保持尺度并校准预激活统计量。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法能防止dying ReLU问题、减缓激活方差衰减、缓解梯度消失，在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、表格数据集和少样本设置中均优于现有初始化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能稳定深度架构中的信号和梯度流动，实现深度网络的稳定训练，适用于ReLU族激活函数。

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

Result: 在不同数据集和骨干模型上的实验表明，PerturbEmbedding显著提高了GNN的鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于现有方法，并能同时抵御随机（非目标）和对抗性（目标）扰动。

Conclusion: PerturbEmbedding提供了一个有效的统一框架来增强GNN的鲁棒性，通过直接在隐藏嵌入层进行扰动操作，实现了对多种扰动类型的统一处理，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

Motivation: 子图联邦学习面临严重的数据异构性问题，传统加权聚合方法容易因稀疏和偏置子图导致快速过拟合，使客户端相似性矩阵停滞或崩溃，失去聚合效果。

Method: 提出CUFL框架：客户端采用课程学习自适应选择边进行训练，从通用跨客户端子结构逐步过渡到客户端特定结构；服务器端使用随机参考图上重构的细粒度结构指标来估计客户端相似性，改进加权聚合。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的广泛实验证实，CUFL相比相关基线方法取得了优越的性能表现。

Conclusion: CUFL通过课程学习调节个性化过程，有效防止早期过拟合，实现了从通用知识交换到客户端特定知识传播的渐进式个性化联邦学习。

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

### [326] [Memory Limitations of Prompt Tuning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00421)
*Maxime Meyer,Mario Michelessa,Caroline Chaux,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了Transformer的记忆能力随提示长度线性增长，并首次形式化证明了大型语言模型在扩展上下文中的性能退化现象，揭示了Transformer架构处理长序列的内在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管提示调优在实践中有显著效果，但其理论分析仍然有限。现有理论工作主要关注通用近似性质，而本文旨在探索Transformer的记忆能力这一不同理论层面。

Method: 通过理论分析证明两个主要结论：1）Transformer记忆的信息量不能超过提示长度的线性增长；2）形式化证明Transformer在扩展上下文中的性能退化现象。

Result: 证明了Transformer的记忆能力存在根本性限制，其记忆信息量随提示长度线性增长，且无论上下文大小如何，Transformer的内在记忆能力都是有限的。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了对Transformer架构内在局限性的基本理解，特别是在处理长序列方面的能力限制，为理解大型语言模型的行为提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个通用框架来评估稀疏性鲁棒性，并系统研究了现代大语言模型（包括扩散LLM）中FFN层的激活稀疏性现象，发现了普遍模式并提供了实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 输入相关的激活稀疏性是深度学习模型的一个重要特性，但在ReLU激活函数的研究方法无法直接迁移到现代大语言模型，因为LLM已放弃使用ReLU而采用其他激活函数，导致当前研究分散且缺乏共识。

Method: 提出了一个评估稀疏性鲁棒性的通用框架，系统研究了现代LLM（包括扩散LLM）中FFN层的激活稀疏性现象。

Result: 发现了LLM中激活稀疏性的普遍模式，为理解这一现象提供了深刻见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果为模型设计和加速中利用激活稀疏性提供了实用指南，有助于统一当前分散的研究现状。

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了不同图像自回归模型中的记忆化模式，发现层次化架构早期出现记忆化，标准架构后期集中记忆化，并通过干预最记忆化组件显著减少数据泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像自回归模型在生成质量和速度方面表现优异，但存在训练数据记忆化问题，可能带来隐私风险，需要深入理解记忆化发生的位置和方式。

Method: 通过细粒度记忆化测量方法，分析不同图像自回归架构中的记忆化模式，包括层次化每分辨率架构和标准每令牌预测架构。

Result: 发现记忆化模式因架构而异：层次化架构早期出现且随分辨率加深，标准架构集中在后期处理阶段。通过干预最记忆化组件，显著降低数据提取能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图像生成模型的内部行为特征，为减轻隐私风险提供了实用策略，在保持生成图像质量的同时有效减少数据泄露风险。

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在建模多感知视角的时空相关性方面存在不足，忽视了交通模式与空间相关性的交互融合，且受限于空间异质性而未能考虑消息传递中的区域异质性。

Method: 提出模式-空间交互融合框架（包含模式和空间模块），从全局到局部视角捕获模式与空间相关性；设计基于消息传递的区域感知图卷积网络，利用区域特征库重构数据驱动的消息传递。

Result: 在三个真实交通数据集上的实验表明，PSIRAGCN在平衡计算成本的同时优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: PSIRAGCN通过交互融合框架和区域感知机制，有效提升了交通预测性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

TL;DR: 提出基于图注意力网络（GAT）的基因通路建模框架，相比传统MLP方法在预测通路动态方面MSE降低81%，并能正确发现基因相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型将基因视为无结构标记或把通路作为"基因袋"处理，忽略了已知的通路结构和基因间相互作用。

Method: 使用图注意力网络（GAT）在基因级别建模通路，通过边干预编码药物机制，提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在未见治疗条件下预测通路动态时，GAT比MLP的MSE降低81%；成功从原始时间序列mRNA数据中重新发现TP53-MDM2-MDM4反馈环中的所有五个基因-基因相互作用。

Conclusion: GAT框架能更好地泛化并生成新的生物学假设，展示了直接从实验数据中发现基因相互作用的潜力。

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological
hypotheses directly from experimental data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习攻击策略仅破坏全局模型性能，但攻击者自身模型也会受损，缺乏实际动机。真实场景中攻击者追求的是获得竞争优势，而非单纯破坏。

Method: 提出FedThief框架：1）上传阶段修改内容以降低全局模型性能；2）利用分歧感知集成技术（量化私有模型与全局模型偏差）整合全局更新和本地知识来增强私有模型性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法能有效降低全局模型性能，同时让攻击者获得显著优于全局模型的集成模型。

Conclusion: SCFL攻击范式揭示了联邦学习中攻击者追求自身竞争优势的新威胁，FedThief框架成功实现了同时破坏全局模型和提升攻击者模型性能的双重目标。

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASC方法通过整合财务和文本数据，使用优化的权重参数和特征向量选择，在中小企业信用监测中实现了比基线方法高18%的轮廓分数，并能识别出有意义的聚类模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构数据（数值财务变量和文本记录）对信用监测提出了重大挑战，需要开发能够有效整合这两种数据类型的方法。

Method: 提出高级谱聚类(ASC)方法，通过优化权重参数整合财务和文本相似性，并采用新颖的特征值-轮廓优化方法选择特征向量。

Result: 在1,428家中小企业数据集上，ASC的轮廓分数比单类型数据基线方法高18%，识别出51%的低风险企业包含'社会招聘'术语，招聘导向型中小企业违约风险低30%。

Conclusion: ASC通过将谱聚类理论与异构数据应用相结合，能够识别有意义的聚类模式，支持更精准有效的信用干预措施，并在多种聚类算法中表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

Conclusion: IMST框架成功整合了文本和财务数据，在中小企业信用评估中表现出更高的准确性、可解释性和计算效率，为信用风险评估提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种从图神经网络向Kolmogorov-Arnold网络进行知识蓄粉的新框架SA-DSD，通过改进的FR-KAN+模型和自适应重权损失机制，在大幅减少参数量和推理时间的同时提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决边缘设备上深度学习模型部署的资源约束问题，需要将GNN的知识转移到更高效的模型中，但传统MLP因固定激活函数和全连接结构无法有效捕捉GNN学到的复杂邻居依赖关系。

Method: 提出SA-DSD框架，改进Fourier KAN(FR-KAN)并用FR-KAN+作为学生模型，通过可学习频率基和相位移机制提升非线性拟合能力，构建基于教师-学生预测一致性的边际级采样概率矩阵，设计自适应重权损失机制。

Result: 在6个实际数据集上，SA-DSD较三个GNN教师模型性能提升3.05%-3.62%，较FR-KAN+模型提升15.61%，参数量减少16.96倍，推理时间减少55.75%。

Conclusion: SA-DSD框架通过创新的知识蓄粉方法，有效解决了边缘环境下模型压缩和加速的挑战，为消费电子产品中深度学习模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

Motivation: 系统退化通常不可直接观测且被运行变化所主导，传统残差方法难以有效分离退化过程，特别是在动态响应系统中。神经常微分方程(NODEs)虽然能推断潜在动态，但在慢快系统中存在数值刚性和训练困难的问题。

Result: 在动态响应系统(如桥梁)和稳态系统(如航空发动机)上的综合评估表明，H-CDE能有效分离退化与运行动态，性能优于残差基线方法，提供更准确、鲁棒和可解释的推断。

Conclusion: H-CDE框架成功解决了从传感器数据中推断系统退化的关键挑战，通过多尺度建模和退化解纠缠机制，为状态监测和预测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

*Kushagra Chandak,Vincent Liu,Haanvid Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了CAEL-MIPS方法，通过学习上下文-动作嵌入来最小化MIPS估计器的均方误差，解决了传统IPS方法在大动作空间或探索不足情况下的高方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的逆倾向得分加权(IPS)方法在动作空间大或上下文-动作空间探索不足时存在显著方差问题。现有的边缘化IPS(MIPS)方法虽然利用动作嵌入缓解了这一问题，但这些嵌入没有最小化估计器的均方误差，也没有考虑上下文信息。

Method: 提出了CAEL-MIPS方法，从离线数据中学习上下文-动作嵌入，基于MIPS的偏差和方差理论分析，提出了最小化均方误差的目标函数。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界数据集上的实证研究表明，该估计器在均方误差方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAEL-MIPS通过有效学习上下文-动作嵌入，显著改善了离线策略评估的准确性，特别是在大动作空间和探索不足的场景下。

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

Motivation: 面对表格数据中常见的数据缺失问题，虽然现有生成模型如VAE和GAN已被用于揕补，但神经细胞自动机（NCA）这种强大计算模型被忽略了，本文尝试填补这一空白。

Method: 提出一种受神经细胞自动机启发的新题揕补方法，通过适当的调整使NCA模型能够处理数据缺失问题。

Result: 多个实验结果证明，该模型在揕补误差和揕补后的性能表现方面都超过了现有的最优方法。

Conclusion: 神经细胞自动机是一种有效的数据揕补工具，通过适当的调整可以成功处理表格数据的缺失值问题，为数据揕补领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

Motivation: 区域天气预报对气候适应和灾害缓解至关重要，但现有研究缺乏统一的数据集和实验设置，限制了公平比较和可复现性

Method: 构建了基于高分辨率区域再分析产品的数据集，实现了UNet、Transformer和图神经网络等多种架构，并评估了不同的边界条件策略和训练目标

Abstract: Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate
adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine
learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional
forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use
different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and
reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.
IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future
development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing
regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at

TL;DR: 开发基于强化学习的半按需公交接驳服务，使用共享自动驾驶车辆和动态区域调度控制，在固定路线和按需服务之间取得平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低密度地区公共交通可达性问题，结合固定路线公交的成本效益和需求响应式运输的适应性

Method: 使用深度强化学习（近端策略优化算法）动态分配车辆到细分区域，基于实时需求波动进行调度控制

Result: 相比传统固定路线服务，多服务16%乘客但成本高13%；RL控制带来2.4%额外乘客和1.4%成本增加

Conclusion: 展示了SAV接驳车与机器学习技术整合的潜力，为解决多模式交通系统中的首末英里问题奠定了基础

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低数据条件下，如何有效引导生成模型探索药理学相关的化学空间是药物发现中的主要挑战。

Method: VECTOR+结合属性引导的表征学习和可控分子生成，适用于回归和分类任务，通过对比学习实现数据高效的功能化学空间探索。

Result: 在PD-L1抑制剂和激酶抑制剂数据集上，VECTOR+生成了新颖、可合成的候选分子，其中PD-L1抑制剂的最佳对接分数达到-17.6 kcal/mol，优于参考抑制剂(-15.4 kcal/mol)。分子动力学模拟确认结合稳定性。

Conclusion: VECTOR+是一个稳健、可扩展的方法，在低数据条件下实现了对比学习和生成模型的结合，为AI加速的药物发现提供了可重复的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出DELTA框架解决隐私保护数据重编程问题，通过两阶段变分解耦生成学习，在提升目标任务性能的同时降低敏感属性预测准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据常包含敏感属性且受严格法规约束，现有特征工程主要关注下游任务性能而忽视隐私泄露风险，需要新的隐私保护特征转换方法

Method: 两阶段变分解耦生成学习框架：第一阶段使用策略引导强化学习发现具有下游任务效用的特征转换；第二阶段采用变分LSTM seq2seq编码器-解码器，结合效用-隐私解耦潜在空间设计和对抗-因果解耦正则化

Result: 在8个数据集上实验显示，DELTA将预测性能提升约9.3%，隐私泄露减少约35%

Conclusion: DELTA框架能够实现鲁棒的隐私感知数据转换，有效平衡效用和隐私保护需求

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

TL;DR: MAGN通过将变分模态分解转换为可训练的神经模块，解决了传统分解方法计算效率低和需要手动调参的问题，在大型时空预测任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络在时空预测中存在频谱纠缠问题，而分解集成方法如VMGCN虽然提高了准确性，但存在计算效率低和需要手动超参数调优的局限性。

Method: 提出模式自适应图网络(MAGN)，包含：(1)展开的VMD模块用固定深度网络替代迭代优化；(2)模式特定的可学习带宽约束自适应空间异质性并防止频谱重叠。

Result: 在LargeST基准测试(6,902个传感器，2.41亿观测值)上，MAGN比VMGCN减少85-95%的预测误差，分解时间减少250倍，优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MAGN成功解决了分解集成方法的计算效率和调参问题，为大规模时空预测提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统池式主动学习方法（如BALD）在评估大规模未标记数据集时计算成本过高，特别是在包含数十亿样本的药物发现虚拟筛选中，这一问题尤为突出。

Method: 提出BALD-GFlowNet框架，利用生成流网络（GFlowNets）直接按照BALD奖励比例采样对象，用生成式采样替代传统的池式获取方法。

Result: 在虚拟筛选实验中，BALD-GFlowNet实现了与标准BALD基线相当的性能，同时生成了结构更多样化的分子，且其可扩展性与未标记池的大小无关。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效、可扩展的分子发现提供了一个有前景的方向，解决了大规模主动学习的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

TL;DR: TAAM是一种无需重放数据、资源高效的持续图学习方法，通过神经突触调制器动态调节冻结骨干网络的内部计算流，有效解决了稳定性-可塑性困境和资源密集型预训练问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前持续图学习方法面临两个主要问题：1)稳定性-可塑性困境，重放方法在两者间难以平衡且存储成本高；2)资源密集型预训练，领先的无重放方法严重依赖预训练骨干网络，资源负担重。

Method: 提出任务感知自适应调制(TAAM)方法，核心是神经突触调制器(NSM)：1)训练时通过原型引导策略从相似历史调制器深度复制初始化新NSM；2)推理时为每个任务选择最相关的冻结NSM，对冻结GNN骨干进行细粒度节点注意力调制。

Result: 在六个GCIL基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAAM全面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TAAM通过动态调制冻结骨干网络的内部计算流，而非重放数据或微调整个网络，为导航稳定性-可塑性困境开辟了新路径，实现了资源高效且性能优越的持续图学习。

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Motivation: 传统DST分类器存在隶属函数建模过于简化和BPA带来的置信结构利用不足的问题，限制了在复杂现实场景中的有效性。

Method: 采用选择性建模策略（单高斯和高斯混合模型），并通过交叉验证指导模型选择；提出将可能性分布转换为BPA的新方法；将置信结构BPA生成方法应用于证据K近邻分类器。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著提升了分类器的有效性和鲁棒性，证实了改进的DST框架在复杂不确定性建模中的优越性能。

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在异质图（heterophilic graphs）中结合边方向性和表达能力强的消息传递对节点分类的影响，提出了两种多项式可表达的GNN架构，在多个基准数据集上取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在异质图中表现不佳，因为它们依赖局部同质邻域。先前研究表明建模边方向性可以提高有效同质性，同时多项式可表达的GNN在捕获高阶特征交互方面显示出潜力。

Method: 提出了两种架构：(1) 多项式可表达的GAT基线（Poly），(2) 方向感知变体（Dir-Poly），分别聚合传入和传出边。两种模型都学习输入特征的置换等变高次多项式，同时保持可扩展性。

Result: 在五个基准异质数据集上的实验表明，Poly模型始终优于现有基线，Dir-Poly在具有固有方向性的图（如Roman Empire）上提供额外增益，达到最先进结果。在无向图上引入人工方向性并不总是有帮助。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了边方向和表达能力强的特征建模在异质图学习中的互补作用，方向性消息传递的益处是上下文相关的。

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

TL;DR: ProCause是一个新的生成式深度学习方法，用于评估规范性过程监控方法，通过整合多种因果推理架构和时序模型来解决现有RealCause方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RealCause方法在评估规范性过程监控方法时存在两个主要问题：忽略了过程数据中的时序依赖性，以及仅依赖单一的TARNet因果推理模型架构，限制了评估效果。

Method: 提出了ProCause方法，支持序列模型（如LSTM）和非序列模型，并整合了多种因果推理架构（S-Learner、T-Learner、TARNet和集成模型）。

Result: 研究发现TARNet并非总是最佳选择，集成模型提供更一致的可靠性，当存在时序依赖性时，使用LSTM可以改善评估效果。通过真实世界数据分析验证了ProCause的实用性。

Conclusion: ProCause为规范性过程监控方法提供了更可靠的评估框架，通过支持多种模型架构和时序处理能力，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Result: 在COD-Cluster17基准测试中，即使使用简单回归方法，SinkFast也显著优于更复杂的流匹配方法

Conclusion: SinkFast方法为分子晶体结构预测提供了更高效准确的解决方案，在计算效率和性能方面都有显著提升

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

<details>

Motivation: SHAP解释方法无法区分因果关系和相关关系，在特征高度相关时经常错误归因特征重要性，这在医疗等高风险领域尤为重要

Method: 结合Peter-Clark算法进行因果发现和IDA算法进行因果强度量化，将因果关系统一到SHAP特征归因框架中

Result: Causal SHAP降低了仅与目标相关但不具因果关系的特征归因分数，在合成和真实数据集上验证了有效性

Conclusion: 为可解释AI提供了实用的因果感知模型解释框架，特别适用于医疗等需要理解真实因果关系的领域

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

Motivation: 传统天赋识别方法依赖人工流程、过于关注学业成绩，且通常在高等教育阶段才进行干预，忽视了非学术天赋和早期干预机会。

Method: 使用半监督多模态神经网络，整合Transformer、LSTM和ANN架构，基于1,041名中学生的离线教育数据，通过聚类奖项记录和提取学习行为特征来预测7种天赋类型。

Result: 模型取得了0.908的分类准确率和0.908的ROCAUC值，表现出色。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够在学生发展的早期阶段有效识别多样化天赋，具有重要的教育应用价值。

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations methods provide an important tool in the field of
{interpretable machine learning}. Recent advances in this direction have
focused on diffusion models to explain a deep classifier. However, these
techniques have predominantly focused on problems in computer vision. In this
paper, we focus on tabular data typical in finance and the social sciences and
propose a novel guided reverse process for categorical features based on an
approximation to the Gumbel-softmax distribution. Furthermore, we study the
effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the
Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular
datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of
interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate
that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and
realistic counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several
large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.
The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and
in-distribution counterfactual samples.

TL;DR: DTRNet是一种改进的Transformer架构，通过动态令牌路由机制，让大多数令牌跳过二次成本的交叉令牌混合，同时保持轻量级线性更新，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在每个层对每个令牌都应用二次自注意力计算，导致计算成本高昂。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。

Method: 提出动态令牌路由网络(DTRNet)，保留MLP模块，将大多数令牌的注意力成本降至线性。通过路由机制，只有约10%的令牌需要经过完整的注意力计算。

Result: DTRNet在匹配FLOPs的情况下，在准确性和内存使用方面均优于MoD和D-LLM等基于路由的层跳过方法，同时路由更少的令牌到完整注意力。效率增益随序列长度扩展，对长上下文输入显著减少FLOPs。

Conclusion: DTRNet通过将令牌更新与注意力混合解耦，大幅减少了二次计算份额，为Transformer提供了简单、高效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图神经网络中特征叠加现象，通过控制实验分析GNN潜在空间中多个特征共享方向的问题，发现宽度增加会产生相位模式，拓扑结构将重叠印记到节点特征中，更锐利的池化能提高轴对齐并减少通道共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释图神经网络(GNNs)很困难，因为消息传递混合了信号且内部通道很少与人类概念对齐。研究GNN潜在空间中的叠加现象（多个特征共享方向）。

Method: 使用具有明确图概念的控制实验，在图形级别提取类条件质心特征，在节点级别提取线性探测方向特征，然后用简单的基不变诊断分析其几何结构。

Result: 发现增加宽度会产生重叠的相位模式；拓扑结构将重叠印记到节点级特征中；更锐利的池化能提高轴对齐并减少通道共享；浅层模型可以陷入亚稳态低秩嵌入。

Conclusion: 这些结果将表示几何与具体设计选择（宽度、池化和最终层激活）联系起来，并提出了使GNN更具可解释性的实用方法。

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

TL;DR: SCOUT是一种混合架构，通过局部压缩token和稀疏注意力机制，在保持Transformer表达能力的同时显著降低计算和内存成本，在长序列任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer的二次注意力复杂度限制了长序列的可扩展性，而线性模型如Mamba和滑动窗口注意力虽然高效，但在长序列上可能因无法保留远距离token的详细信息而导致性能下降。

Method: 提出SCOUT架构：1）使用线性局部混合器（Mamba或SWA）丰富token嵌入；2）对压缩的检查点token应用稀疏注意力而非所有先前token；3）通过局部段压缩和稀疏注意力实现计算效率。

Result: 在相同计算预算下，SCOUT在长上下文语言建模和推理任务中优于强基线，在4亿和13亿参数规模的语言建模和常识推理任务上匹配全注意力Transformer，同时实现更高的端到端吞吐量。

Conclusion: SCOUT成功平衡了计算效率和模型性能，通过混合设计实现了接近全注意力的表达能力，同时保持亚二次的内存增长，为长序列处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出自适应重采样训练方法ART，基于类别性能动态调整训练数据分布，在类别不平衡分类任务中显著优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重采样方法使用固定分布，忽略了类别学习难度的变化，限制了模型性能。需要一种能根据模型表现动态调整采样策略的方法

Method: ART方法定期基于类别级macro F1分数更新训练数据分布，在类别层面进行自适应调整，避免实例级难度建模的噪声和异常值敏感性

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ART始终优于重采样和算法级方法，平均提升macro F1分数2.64个百分点，改进具有统计显著性

Conclusion: ART提供了一种可靠的自适应重采样方法，能够持续提供最强的macro F1性能，是处理类别不平衡分类任务的优选方案

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a
Byzantine-free setting.

Conclusion: MEPT提供了一个有效且高效的流形映射框架，通过理论分析和神经激活通路可视化验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is

TL;DR: FlexMDM是一种灵活的掩码扩散模型，能够处理可变长度序列生成，解决了传统MDM只能生成固定长度序列的限制，同时在数学推理和代码填充任务上表现出显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型(MDMs)虽然具有并行推理和任意顺序生成的优点，但无法支持token插入操作，只能生成固定长度的序列，这限制了其在需要可变长度生成任务中的应用。

Method: 基于随机插值框架扩展，FlexMDM通过在序列中插入掩码token并逐步去掩码的方式来生成可变长度序列，同时保持了MDMs的任意顺序推理能力。

Result: FlexMDM在困惑度上与MDM相当，但在长度统计建模上表现更好；在迷宫规划任务中成功率提高约60%；通过微调LLaDA-8B模型，在数学推理(GSM8K从58%提升到67%)和代码填充(从52%提升到65%)任务上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: FlexMDM成功解决了MDM固定长度生成的限制，提供了灵活的可变长度序列生成能力，同时保持了高效的并行推理特性，在多个任务上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

TL;DR: 提出基于大腦模型LaBraM的相關性注意力映射方法，利用IMU數據的空間通道關係來識別EEG信號中的運動偽影，相比傳統單模態方法顯著提升運動場景下的魯棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信號易受運動偽影污染，傳統單模態方法如ASR和ICA未充分利用IMU等同時記錄的運動信息，限制了腦機接口在真實場景中的部署。

Method: 使用精調的大型腦模型LaBraM，通過相關性注意力映射分析IMU數據的空間通道關係來檢測EEG中的運動相關偽影。模型僅需5.9小時EEG-IMU數據訓練，參數量約920萬。

Result: 與ASR-ICA基準相比，在不同時間尺度和運動活動下，引入IMU參考信號顯著提高了多種運動場景下的魯棒性。

Conclusion: 整合IMU運動信息的多模態方法能有效改善EEG運動偽影去除，為腦機接口的實際應用提供更可靠的解決方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

TL;DR: RefineStat是一个语言模型驱动的框架，通过强制执行语义约束和诊断感知的细化，解决小型语言模型生成概率程序时的语法和语义错误问题。


<details>

Motivation: 概率编程在建模不确定性方面很强大，但小型语言模型生成概率程序时经常产生语法和语义错误，如错误的推理结构。受概率程序员领域专业知识和调试策略的启发。

Method: 引入RefineStat框架：1) 强制执行语义约束确保程序包含有效分布和格式正确的参数；2) 当可靠性检查失败时，应用诊断感知的细化，重新采样先验或似然组件。

Result: 在多个概率编程代码生成任务上评估，使用小型语言模型时，RefineStat生成的程序既语法正确又统计可靠，通常匹配或超越闭源大型语言模型(如OpenAI o3)的表现。

Conclusion: RefineStat框架有效解决了小型语言模型生成概率程序时的错误问题，通过约束和细化机制实现了与大型语言模型相当甚至更好的性能。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

Conclusion: CCE指标充分充分解决了现有评估指标的缺陷，具有优秀的稳健性、敏感性和高效性，RankEval平台为评估指标的对比提供了标准化方法。

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

Conclusion: SC-GIR框架能够学习到紧凑且信息丰富的潜在表示，有效支持面向目标的语义通信，在机器对机器任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将表演性预测扩展到非线性场景，建立了完整的理论框架和实用算法，为处理现实世界中的表演性预测问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node

Conclusion: StoxLSTM通过将随机建模与xLSTM结合，显著提升了时间序列建模的性能，为处理复杂时间动态提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and
stronger generalization ability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL)损失函数，通过最小化高维数据和低维嵌入之间的关系矩阵差异来保持向量空间的正交性和线性独立性等关键属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降维过程会扭曲向量空间的关键属性（如正交性和线性独立性），这些属性对于跨模态检索、聚类和分类等任务至关重要。需要一种方法来保持这些几何关系。

Method: 使用关系保持损失(RPL)，通过比较高维数据和低维嵌入的Gram矩阵或余弦相似度矩阵的差异来训练神经网络进行非线性投影。该方法基于矩阵扰动理论推导出误差边界。

Result: 初步实验表明，RPL能够在减少嵌入维度的同时，在很大程度上保持下游任务的性能，这得益于其对关键向量空间属性的保持。

Conclusion: RPL不仅适用于降维任务，还可广泛应用于跨域对齐、迁移学习、知识蒸馏、公平性和不变性、去中心化、图和流形学习以及联邦学习等领域，确保分布式嵌入保持几何一致性。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

Motivation: 传统GNN表达能力理论存在两个主要问题：1）大多数实际任务不需要超越WL测试的表达能力；2）二元分类和理想化假设无法反映GNN的实际能力。需要一个新的理论框架来弥合理论与实践之间的差距

Method: 提出Message Passing Complexity (MPC)这一连续度量方法，量化GNN架构通过消息传递解决特定任务的难度。MPC能够捕捉实际限制（如过度压缩），同时保留表达能力理论的理论不可能性结果

Conclusion: MPC超越了传统的表达能力理论，提供了一个更强大和细致入微的框架来理解和改进GNN架构，有效缩小了理论与实践之间的差距

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

Conclusion: 通过轻量级的约束向量协调机制，可以在限制通信和观测条件下实现高效的多组件协作，为边缘计算系统提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

Motivation: 解决在计算昂贵的仿真环境中样本效率低的问题，特别是在宽状态空间环境中当前采样策略效果有限

Method: 使用强化学习训练的策略来采样确定性仿真环境，包括随机智能体、专家智能体和最大熵区域探索智能体的混合数据集采样

Result: 混合数据集在所有采样数据集上获得最佳评分，对状态空间表示至关重要，显著提升了采样效率

Conclusion: 该方法改进了现有技术水平，为在复杂仿真器上应用代理辅助强化学习策略优化开辟了道路

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

TL;DR: 提出了一种等变U型神经算子(E-UNO)，用于学习Cahn-Hilliard方程控制的相分离过程，通过结合全局谱卷积和多分辨率架构，实现了对相场变量演化的准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高且缺乏灵活性，现有神经算子架构难以捕捉多尺度行为并忽略物理对称性，需要开发更高效的替代方法。

Method: 采用等变U型神经算子架构，结合全局谱卷积和多分辨率U型结构，通过调节平移等变性来符合底层物理规律，从短期历史动态中学习相场演化。

Result: E-UNO在精细尺度和高频结构上优于标准傅里叶神经算子和U型神经算子基线，具有更好的泛化能力、更少的训练数据需求和物理一致的动力学行为。

Conclusion: E-UNO作为一种高效替代方案，能够有效处理复杂相场系统，通过编码对称性和尺度层次结构实现了物理一致的预测性能。

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种基于重构不确定性估计(RUE)的预测区间计算方法，用于生命体征预测中的不确定性量化，以提高临床决策的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在生命体征预测中表现出潜力，但由于缺乏可靠的不确定性量化（特别是校准的预测区间），临床医生难以信任和解释模型输出，这限制了其在医疗领域的部署。

Method: 提出了两种RUE衍生预测区间方法：1）参数化方法-假设预测误差和不确定性估计遵循高斯copula分布，实现闭式预测区间计算；2）非参数化方法-基于K近邻算法，使用相似验证实例经验估计条件误差分布。

Result: 在包含分钟级和小时级采样的两个大型公共数据集上评估，高斯copula方法在低频数据上持续优于conformal prediction基线，而KNN方法在高频数据上表现最佳。

Conclusion: RUE衍生的预测区间方法在提供可解释、不确定性感知的生命体征预测方面具有临床前景，能够为临床决策提供更可靠的支持。

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

Motivation: 现有基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法需要大量计算和数据集，导致训练成本高、数据效率低

Method: 结合离线阶段基于多样性、影响力和适当难度的数据筛选，以及在线阶段基于探索性指标的动态样本过滤和重放机制

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中表现优于现有方法，仅使用20%训练数据就能在AIME24和AIME25上分别实现1.85倍和1.66倍的加速

Conclusion: DEPO通过高效的数据选择策略有效解决了RLVR方法的高成本和低效率问题，为大规模推理模型的训练提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Motivation: 工业级电池管理涉及多种任务，每种任务使用不同的数据，构建特定任务的方法需要大量数据和工程努力，限制了智能电池管理的可扩展性。

Method: 提出灵活掩码自编码器（FMAE）框架，能够从异构数据中学习统一的电池表示，处理缺失数据通道，并捕捉跨数据片段的相互关联。

Result: FMAE在5个电池管理任务和11个电池数据集上始终优于所有特定任务方法，在剩余寿命预测任务中使用50倍少的推理数据仍保持最先进结果，在缺失系统电压等关键信息时仍能应用且性能影响很小。

Conclusion: FMAE展示了一条实现灵活、数据高效模型的实用路径，简化了动态系统的现实世界多任务管理。

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为优化提供了基于数学理论的全局指导，克服了传统启发式自适应方法的局限性，建立了优化景观几何与算法性能的理论联系

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

Conclusion: DPF-CM框架有效解决了中文医疗LLM训练中的数据质量和隐私保护问题，为医疗领域大语言模型的安全高效训练提供了完整解决方案

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

Conclusion: VQ-VAE可以通过简单的蒸馏策略转化为可处理模型，特别是在VQ-VAE未充分利用其潜在空间的情况下效果显著

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了实例依赖成本敏感分类器在信用评分中成本效率与解释稳定性之间的权衡，发现虽然IDCS模型提高了成本效率，但其产生的SHAP和LIME解释稳定性显著低于传统模型，特别是在类别不平衡加剧时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管实例依赖成本敏感分类器在提高信用评分成本效率方面具有潜力，但其对模型解释稳定性的影响尚未被研究，而监管机构对透明度的要求日益增加，因此需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用四个公开信用评分数据集，首先评估IDCS分类器的判别能力和成本效率，引入新指标增强跨数据集可比性；然后通过控制重采样研究SHAP和LIME特征重要性排名在不同类别不平衡程度下的稳定性。

Result: IDCS分类器虽然提高了成本效率，但产生的解释稳定性显著低于传统模型，特别是随着类别不平衡增加，解释稳定性进一步下降。

Conclusion: 在监管对可解释性要求日益严格的背景下，该研究强调了解决IDCS分类器稳定性问题的紧迫性，以确保其成本优势不会被不稳定或不可信的解释所削弱。

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous

in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: Reward maximization, safe exploration, and intrinsic motivation are often
studied as separate objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). We present a
unified geometric framework, that views these goals as instances of a single
optimization problem on the space of achievable long-term behavior in an
environment. Within this framework, classical methods such as policy mirror
descent, natural policy gradient, and trust-region algorithms naturally
generalize to nonlinear utilities and convex constraints. We illustrate how
this perspective captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity
objectives, and outline open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep
RL.

### [399] [Hierarchical Motion Captioning Utilizing External Text Data Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01471)
*Clayton Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种分层次的运动描述方法，通过大语言模型生成详细的低级描述，并结合检索机制从外部文本源获取知识，显著提高了运动描述的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动描述方法需要高级描述注释的运动数据，但现有数据集缺乏这种注释和低级详细描述，限制了模型的性能。

Method: 两步分层方法：1）使用大语言模型为高级描述生成详细的低级描述注释，并用于重新训练运动-文本模型；2）引入检索机制，将详细描述与外部文本源的候选高级描述对齐，结合运动特征生成准确的高级描述。

Result: 在三个运动-文本数据集（HumanML3D、KIT、BOTH57M）上进行实验，在BLEU-1、BLEU-4、CIDEr和ROUGE-L指标上平均性能提升6%-50%，超越了最新的M2T-Interpretable方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够利用外部文本源的知识，显著提高运动描述的准确性，尤其在现有数据集未覆盖的运动上表现优异，为运动理解和描述领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

Motivation: 现有的基于结构药物设计生成模型存在概率动态不稳定、生成分子大小与蛋白质口袋几何不匹配的问题，导致质量不一致和脱靶效应。

Method: 采用高效的流匹配框架建模生成过程，构建离散原子类型的条件流匹配形式，整合蛋白质-配体交互预测器指导向量场向高亲和力区域生成，并设计基于蛋白质口袋信息的原子数预测器来对齐分子大小。

Result: 在CrossDocked2020基准测试中，PAFlow在结合亲和力方面达到新的最先进水平（最高-8.31平均Vina分数），同时保持有利的分子性质。

Conclusion: PAFlow通过创新的先验交互指导和原子数预测机制，有效解决了SBDD中的关键挑战，为基于结构的药物设计提供了更可靠和高效的生成解决方案。

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

Method: 提出伪重放半监督持续学习框架，包含无监督识别和重放检测两个组件。使用无监督GAN检测新异常模式，通过生成器学习每个任务的数据分布，当新任务出现时生成代表先前类别的伪数据

Result: 在四个公开ECG数据集上验证了框架有效性，实验结果表明该方法在识别新异常的同时，对现有ECG信号的检测保持了良好性能

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决ECG异常检测中的类别不平衡和存储限制问题，通过伪重放策略实现了持续学习，在检测新异常的同时维持了对已有模式的识别能力

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

Motivation: 解决预训练模型在持续学习中灾难性遗忘的问题，现有方法依赖反向传播和梯度优化，计算密集且不适合资源受限环境。

Method: 使用CMA-ES优化输入层提示嵌入，通过非线性随机投影和递归最小二乘法将任务特定知识编码到知识编码矩阵中，实现分类器的增量更新。

Result: 显著降低平均遗忘率并提高准确性，减少内存使用和运行时间，在长任务序列中保持高知识保留率。

Conclusion: FoRo为预训练模型的持续学习提供了有前景的方向，特别适用于效率和效果都至关重要的实际多媒体应用场景。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现图对比学习(GCL)在标准数据集上的优势有限，未训练的图神经网络、简单多层感知机甚至手工统计特征都能达到或超越GCL性能。GCL的优势主要取决于数据集规模和任务难度，在大规模分子数据集上才显现优势但存在性能平台期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑当前图对比学习方法的实际效果，探究GCL是否真的优于未经训练的基线方法，以及数据集规模和任务复杂度对GCL性能的影响。

Method: 通过在标准图数据集、大规模分子数据集(ogbg-molhiv)和合成数据集上进行系统性实验，比较GCL与未训练GNN、简单MLP和手工统计特征的性能差异，分析性能随数据集规模和任务复杂度的变化规律。

Result: 在标准数据集上，未训练基线方法能与GCL媲美甚至更优；在ogbg-molhiv数据集上，GCL在数千个图规模后才开始超越基线但很快达到性能平台；在合成数据集上，GCL准确率随图数量对数增长，性能差距随任务复杂度变化。

Conclusion: 需要重新评估GCL基准测试中数据集规模的作用，并设计能够避免性能平台的新型GCL算法，数据集规模是影响GCL有效性的关键因素。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然梯度引导、序列蒙特卡洛引导和Feynman-Kac引导等方法在扩散模型中已成熟应用，但这些引导方法尚未扩展到流匹配方法中，而CFM在生成建模中具有快速高质量的优点，需要开发相应的引导技术。

Result: 成功解决了化学反应过渡态生成中手性正确性的挑战性问题，当反应物或产物具有不同手性时，能够生成符合几何约束的可行反应路径。

Conclusion: Feynman-Kac引导的CFM方法为精确控制生成样本提供了有效解决方案，特别是在具有严格几何约束的复杂科学问题中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable

TL;DR: MergeLock是一种主动保护机制，通过扰乱模型参数使其无法被合并，从而防止未经授权的模型合并。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越来越多的微调模型公开可用，模型合并的安全性受到关注。未经授权的合并可能侵犯开发者权益并泄露敏感个人信息。现有方法主要检测合并模型是否源自特定源模型，但无法有效防止非法合并。

Method: 利用Transformer模型中注意力机制的固有对称性，随机采样两对可逆矩阵并应用于Query-Key和Value-Output分支，保持模型输出不变的同时使其远离其他微调模型的共享参数空间。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的大量实验表明，MergeLock在大多数情况下可以将涉及受保护模型的合并模型性能降低95%以上。

Conclusion: MergeLock能有效防止未经授权的模型合并，且受保护的合并模型无法通过低成本恢复方法有效恢复，增强了对抗非法合并的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is
available at https://github.com/hetailang/Merge-Lock.

Conclusion: 该框架为利润导向的激励个性化提供了实用路径，通过干扰感知的提升策略可获得更优性能

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

Method: 引入新颖的Ema2Vec时间嵌入方法，专门设计用于有效处理不规则间隔的自报告数据，捕捉时间序列中的时间依赖性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在建模不规则采样的纵向数据时，纳入时间嵌入的重要性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

Conclusion: OCFL算法能够在不需调整超参数的情况下自动化进行聚类联邦学习，并通过GradCAM本地解释提供了个性化与本地预测可解释性关系的更多洞察。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

Conclusion: 该统一训练框架通过课程学习和多任务学习的结合，有效解决了人类移动预测中的训练效率和预测精度问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

Conclusion: 梯度因果发现方法需要关注数据分布偏差问题，通过适当的模型设计可以控制这些偏差的影响，提高因果结构学习的可靠性。

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

*Tristan Deleu,Padideh Nouri,Yoshua Bengio,Doina Precup*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文建立了Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) 与Trust-PCL之间的等价关系，将RTB置于KL正则化强化学习的理论框架中，并表明KL正则化RL方法可以达到与RTB相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模的最新进展凸显了强化学习在微调中的重要性，特别是KL正则化方法在自回归和扩散模型中表现出色。RTB作为GFlowNets中的目标函数，旨在改进序列生成模型的微调，但其与现有方法的关系尚不明确。

Method: 基于先前将GFlowNets与最大熵强化学习联系起来的工作，本文建立了RTB与具有KL正则化的off-policy RL方法Trust-PCL之间的等价关系。

Result: 通过理论分析证明了RTB与Trust-PCL的等价性，将RTB置于KL正则化强化学习的更广泛理论框架中。在RTB论文的示例中重新评估，发现KL正则化RL方法能够达到相当的性能。

Conclusion: RTB本质上是一种KL正则化强化学习方法，与现有方法具有理论等价性，这为理解和使用RTB提供了新的视角，并表明KL正则化RL方法可以作为RTB的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的多模态认知负荷检测数据集，通过结合n-back测试和真实游戏应用来评估模型在不同领域的泛化能力。研究发现多模态方法优于单模态，但跨域迁移性能仍存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前认知负荷检测模型在真实场景中缺乏泛化性，现有研究多局限于单一任务和有限模态，需要评估模型在现实场景中的鲁棒性和迁移能力。

Method: 构建包含客观性能、主观NASA-TLX评分和任务设计的多模态数据集，使用xLSTM、ConvNeXt和Transformer等先进端到端模型在多模态和应用领域进行系统训练和评估。

Result: 多模态方法 consistently优于单模态基线，不同模态和模型架构对应用子集的影响各异。模型在一个领域训练后迁移到新应用时性能下降，表明通用认知负荷估计仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更具泛化性的认知负荷检测系统提供了可靠基线和实用见解，推动了人机交互和自适应系统领域的研究和实践应用。

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

*Sachin Goyal,David Lopez-Paz,Kartik Ahuja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 蒸馏训练在LLM预训练中重新兴起，研究发现蒸馏能显著改善测试时缩放性能，但会损害上下文学习能力，特别是在归纳头方面。通过二元模型沙盒分析揭示了这些现象背后的共同机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Llama-3.2和Gemma等模型家族的出现，蒸馏在大型语言模型预训练中重新受到关注。虽然蒸馏已被证明能改善统计建模，但其对现代LLM关键范式（如测试时缩放和上下文学习）的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究通过实证分析展示蒸馏预训练对测试时缩放的影响，观察其对上下文学习能力的损害，并使用二元模型沙盒来隔离和分析这些现象背后的共同因素。

Result: 研究发现：1）蒸馏预训练显著改善测试时缩放性能；2）但会损害上下文学习能力，特别是通过归纳头建模的能力；3）通过二元模型沙盒分析揭示了这些观察结果背后的共同机制。

Conclusion: 研究为预训练设计选择提供了重要见解，帮助实践者在蒸馏预训练中做出更明智的决策，平衡测试时缩放和上下文学习能力之间的权衡。

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

TL;DR: 基于Transformer的DeepONet变体，通过分支与干网络结构的双向交叉条件化，在保持简单性和效率的同时提高了气流方程求解的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DeepONet中经典版本与修改版本的准确性-训练效率之间的争执，运算符学习在加速偏微分方程求解中具有广阔应用前景。

Method: 受Transformer启发，设计了一系列具有双向交叉条件化机制的DeepONet变体，在分支网络中注入查询点信息，在干网络中注入输入函数信息，以支持动态依赖关系。

Result: 在四个PDE标准测试中（平流、正应扩散、Burgers、KdV方程），每个情况都有变体能够达到或超越修改DeepONet的准确性，同时提升训练效率。最佳变体与方程本身特性自然匹配。

Conclusion: 交叉条件化的有效性取决于方程的特性和物理机制，通过统计分析验证了方案的稳健性。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的智能体无法通过经验改进性能，需要探索通过强化学习让较弱模型持续提升能力的方法。

Method: 提出分布式异步RL框架，包含持续时间感知梯度更新解决可变时长动作问题，以及环境插装技术通过插入打印语句提供部分奖励信号。

Result: 在MLEBench的12个Kaggle任务上，RL训练的小模型比静态大模型平均性能提升22%。

Conclusion: 强化学习训练的小模型可以超越静态大模型，证明了通过经验学习改进智能体性能的可行性。

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于异常检测的多模态结构，用于车辆空间和共享车系统中的磨损检测，解决了传统手动检测和图像方法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手动检测方法劳动密集且容易出错，而图像基于方法在实时性能和底盘损坏检测方面表现不佳，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用IMU和麦克风等传感器集成到空间前风玻璃的细小设备中，开发了多个多模态自动编码器结构变体，包括集成池化多模态模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能够实时检测车辆磨损，还可扩展到汽车安全和自动驾驶领域，为碳磨损检测提供了一种简洁而高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

Conclusion: SoLS通过区分正负样本的差异化更新策略，有效解决了基础模型在强化学习中的性能退化问题，实现了高效的移动应用控制

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的CMMN扩展方法，通过两种替代方法计算源参考频谱，显著改善了脑电信号中脑源与非脑源独立成分的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑电记录存在伪影、噪声和传感器差异等问题，虽然独立成分分析和自动标记能够去除伪影，但不同设备和环境差异会影响机器学习模型的性能，需要通过适当的频谱归一化来最小化这些差异。

Method: 提出了CMMN方法的扩展版本，采用两种计算源参考频谱的方法：(1)通道平均和L1归一化重心，(2)寻找与目标受试者频谱最接近的源受试者的受试者间映射方法。该方法产生时空可分离滤波器，可用于不同通道数的数据集映射。

Result: 在独立成分分类任务中应用这些滤波器，结果显示在识别脑源与非脑源独立成分方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 所提出的CMMN扩展方法通过改进的频谱归一化技术，有效提高了脑电信号处理中独立成分分类的准确性，对癫痫和精神疾病等神经病理学的诊断和监测具有临床意义。

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

Result: 在合成和真实图像数据集上的实验表明，该框架能有效缓解偏差，同时最小化原始知识的损失

Conclusion: 该研究连接了公平性和持续学习领域，为开发既公平又有效的机器学习系统提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了联邦大语言模型蒸馏中的通信效率问题，为隐私保护的协作学习提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

Result: 创建了一个能够严格评估RL方法在不同形式不确定性下表现的基准测试平台

Conclusion: STORI基准和随机性分类体系为系统评估和比较RL方法提供了统一框架，有助于提升RL在真实随机环境中的鲁棒性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

Motivation: COVID-19大流行对心血管疾病患者的护理造成严重干扰，需要准确建模生物标志物变化来预测疾病进展和指导预防护理。现有工作未能同时处理多目标预测、生物标志物相互依赖关系、时间模式和预测不确定性。

Method: 使用多目标贝叶斯Transformer（MBT）框架，结合预训练的BERT-based transformer，通过贝叶斯变分推断估计不确定性，嵌入机制捕获时间关系，DeepMTR模型捕获生物标志物相互关系。

Result: 在3,390条CVD患者记录上评估，MBT-CB优于其他BERT-based模型，MAE为0.00887，RMSE为0.0135，MSE为0.00027，有效捕获了数据不确定性、模型不确定性和时间动态。

Conclusion: MBT-CB的优异性能表明其在改善CVD生物标志物预测和支持疫情期间临床决策方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

*Weicao Deng,Sangwoo Park,Min Li,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出E-ICL+FCP框架，通过基于Transformer的上下文学习模型模拟全量共形预测的多重重新训练，在保持覆盖率的同时显著提高数据效率和计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决共形预测中分裂CP数据效率低和全量CP计算复杂度高的问题，现有基于元学习或上下文学习的方法未针对CP专门优化，导致预测集过大

Method: 使用排列不变的Transformer-based ICL模型，采用CP感知的损失函数进行训练，模拟FCP所需的多重重新训练过程而无需实际重新训练

Result: 在合成和真实任务上实验表明，E-ICL+FCP相比现有SCP和FCP基线方法，获得了更优的效率-覆盖率权衡

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP框架有效解决了共形预测中的数据效率和计算复杂度问题，为可靠的不确定性量化提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

*Qifu Wen,Xi Zeng,Zihan Zhou,Shuaijun Liu,Mehdi Hosseinzadeh,Reza Rawassizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradES是一种基于梯度的早停方法，通过监控Transformer组件中投影矩阵的梯度大小，在梯度低于阈值时单独冻结该矩阵的参数更新，避免了昂贵的全局验证推理，实现了1.57-7.22倍的训练加速和1.2%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统早停方法需要监控全局验证损失并同时停止所有参数更新，对于大型Transformer模型来说验证推理时间成本很高。不同组件在微调过程中收敛速度不同，需要更精细的早停策略。

Method: 在Transformer的注意力投影和Feed-Forward层矩阵中跟踪反向传播梯度大小。当某个投影矩阵的梯度低于收敛阈值τ时，单独排除该矩阵的更新，允许收敛慢的矩阵继续学习。

Result: 训练时间加速1.57-7.22倍，同时通过早期防止过拟合提高了泛化能力，平均准确率提升1.2%。

Conclusion: GradES通过组件级别的梯度监控实现了高效的参数冻结策略，在显著加速训练的同时还提升了模型性能，为大型Transformer模型的训练提供了有效的早停解决方案。

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

Result: SQS在性能上与最先进的激活函数相当，同时实现了基于权重的可解释性

Conclusion: SQS激活函数成功解决了现有权重分析方法的问题，在保持性能的同时提供了更好的可解释性保证

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks
such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce
Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated
Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks.
Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with
state-of-the-art activation functions whilst enabling weight-based
interpretability

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡计算效率和解质量，特别适用于时间关键的灾害响应应用，为快速决策拯救生命提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

TL;DR: 本研究使用机器学习分析NCAP数据，发现车辆基本特征（车重和车型年份）是预测5星安全评级的主要因素，ADAS功能也有重要贡献，随机森林模型达到89.18%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NCAP安全评级从被动安全扩展到包含ADAS主动安全技术，需要实证研究这些系统如何相互作用，以及它们与车辆基本属性共同预测最高安全评级的能力。

Method: 使用包含5,128个车辆变体的NCAP数据集，比较逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升和SVC四种机器学习模型，采用5折分层交叉验证，并对最佳模型进行超参数优化。

Result: 车重和车型年份占随机森林模型特征相关性的55%以上，ADAS特征也有显著预测贡献。优化后的随机森林模型在测试集上达到89.18%准确率和0.9586的ROC AUC。

Conclusion: 机器学习能有效分析大规模NCAP数据，传统车辆参数和现代ADAS特征共同对获得顶级安全评级具有重要预测价值，为安全评估提供了新见解。

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

### [430] [VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection for Adaptive Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01903)
*Tanvir Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VISP是一种基于梯度波动性的自适应正则化方法，通过动态计算梯度统计量来调整随机噪声注入，选择性地正则化高波动性节点，提升深度神经网络的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法如均匀噪声注入或固定dropout率无法适应网络不同节点的动态特性，需要一种能够根据梯度波动性自适应调整正则化强度的机制。

Method: VISP通过计算梯度统计量的波动性，动态生成并缩放随机投影矩阵，选择性地对高梯度波动性的输入和隐藏节点施加噪声，同时保持稳定表示。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，VISP相比基线模型和固定噪声方法能持续提升泛化性能，同时稳定网络内部动态并促进更鲁棒的特征表示。

Conclusion: VISP通过梯度波动性指导的自适应噪声注入机制，有效缓解过拟合问题，为深度神经网络提供了一种新颖且有效的正则化方法。

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果解缠研究主要针对独立同分布(i.i.d.)数据，但在实际应用中往往存在结构化上下文信息（如网络数据），需要开发能够利用这种结构化信息的非i.i.d.设置下的因果解缠方法。

Abstract: Causal disentanglement from soft interventions is identifiable under the
assumptions of linear interventional faithfulness and availability of both
observational and interventional data. Previous research has looked into this
problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of
network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational
autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

Motivation: 神经架构搜索(NAS)虽然能自动优化架构设计，但计算成本高昂，特别是在多目标优化场景下。需要一种更高效的方法来减少计算负担。

Method: 采用自适应协同克里金辅助的多保真度多目标NAS算法，结合聚类局部采样策略和新型连续编码方法，降低搜索维度并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了NAS的计算成本，独立发现了U-Net架构的优化原则，证明了其在复杂多目标优化问题中的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

Conclusion: 提出的BPS-PT算法通过无限逆温度交换率设置，有效解决了多模态分布采样问题，为贝叶斯推断提供了更高效的采样方法。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

Abstract: Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

Motivation: 目前语言模型预训练中AdamW优化器占主导地位，虽然有众多研究声称替代优化器能提供1.4-2倍速度提升。研究者认为两个方法论问题导致了不公平比较和实践采用困难：不平等的超参数调整和有限或误导性的评估设置。

Method: 进行了系统性研究，测试十种深度学习优化器，涵盖四个模型规模（0.1B-1.2B参数）和数据-模型比例（1-8倍Chinchilla最佳比例）。重点关注严格的超参数调整和在训练结束时进行评估。

Result: 1）不同优化器的最佳超参数差异显著，盲目转移超参数会导致不公平比较。2）许多提出的优化器对优化基准的实际速度提升低于声称，并随模型规模增大而减少，在1.2B参数模型上仅为1.1倍。3）在达到目标训练预算前比较中间检查点可能会误导，因为学习率衰减可能导致优化器排名发生翻转。

Conclusion: 所有最快的优化器（如Muon和Soap）都使用矩阵作为预处理器，将梯度与矩阵相乘而非按元素乘法。但矩阵基优化器的速度提升与模型规模成反比，从0.1B参数模型的1.4倍降到1.2B参数模型的仅1.1倍。

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

*Yi Yin,Guangquan Zhang,Hua Zuo,Jie Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的双层优化框架，通过几何曲率分析实现隐私保护与数据效用的平衡，在保持数据质量的同时有效防御成员推理攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐私保护方法（如数据扰动、泛化和合成数据生成）往往会降低数据准确性、特异性和多样性，影响下游任务性能。如何在隐私保护和数据效用之间找到最优平衡是关键挑战。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：上层任务关注数据效用，使用判别器指导生成过程确保高质量样本；下层任务关注数据隐私，利用数据流形上的局部外在曲率作为个体对MIA脆弱性的量化指标，通过向低曲率区域扰动样本来抑制易受攻击的特征组合。

Result: 广泛的实验评估表明，该方法不仅增强了下游任务对MIA的抵抗能力，而且在样本质量和多样性方面超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 该双层优化框架通过交替优化隐私和效用目标，实现了隐私保护与数据效用的协同平衡，为解决隐私保护数据发布的关键挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

TL;DR: LUCIE-3D是一个轻量级三维气候模拟器，基于SFNO架构，能够捕捉大气垂直结构，响应气候变化强迫，并保持计算效率和长期稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够捕捉大气三维垂直结构、响应气候变化强迫，同时保持计算效率和长期稳定性的轻量级气候模拟器，以支持快速实验和耦合气候动力学研究。

Method: 基于原始LUCIE-2D框架，采用球面傅里叶神经算子（SFNO）主干网络，使用30年ERA5再分析数据在8个垂直σ层上进行训练，将大气CO2作为强迫变量，可选整合海表温度来模拟海气耦合动力学。

Result: LUCIE-3D成功再现了气候平均值、变异性和长期气候变化信号，包括CO2浓度增加下的地表增温和平流层冷却。模型还捕捉了赤道开尔文波、马登-朱利安振荡和环状模等关键动力学过程，并在极端事件统计中表现出可信行为。

Conclusion: LUCIE-3D结合了稳定性、物理一致性和可访问性，是快速实验、消融研究和耦合气候动力学探索的宝贵工具，在古气候研究和未来地球系统模拟方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了蛋白质数据分布稀疏且不均匀的特性，数据稀疏性本身也是不均匀的，需要将局部数据几何融入去噪过程

Method: 使用核密度估计(KDE)作为预处理步骤估计每个数据点的噪声尺度σ，然后训练带有这些数据依赖σ值的分数模型

Result: 经验评估表明该方法在多个指标上取得一致改进

Conclusion: 数据感知的sigma预测对于稀疏高维设置中的生成建模具有重要意义

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 职业事故报告自动分类对提升工作场所安全至关重要，但真实数据集中严重的类别不平衡问题会影响模型性能，特别是对罕见但严重的事故类型。

Method: 采用两步抽象-扩展(ABEX)流程：首先用大语言模型提取核心事故语义，然后用生成模型为少数类创建高质量合成样本；随后使用随机对抗训练(RAT)协议训练轻量级分类器。

Result: 在OSHA数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，macro-F1达到90.32%，显著优于之前的SOTA和微调大模型基线。

Conclusion: 这种协同策略是专门化、不平衡分类任务中强力微调的高效替代方案，验证了生成式数据增强与对抗训练结合的有效性。

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

TL;DR: CIML是一个信息理论多视图学习框架，摒弃了多视图冗余假设，同时利用共同信息和独特信息进行预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图方法假设共同信息对下游任务足够，但忽略了每个视图独特信息的预测潜力。本文旨在开发一个更全面的框架，充分利用两种信息。

Method: 使用Gacs-Korner共同信息最大化提取共享特征，然后基于信息瓶颈压缩任务相关表示。对独特表示也应用信息瓶颈，同时最小化独特与共同表示之间的互信息。

Result: 理论证明学习到的联合表示对下游任务具有预测充分性，实验结果显示模型优于多个最先进方法。

Conclusion: CIML框架成功整合了共同和独特信息，提供了更全面的多视图学习解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

Motivation: 多任务学习中，随着任务数量增加，任务干扰问题日益严重，现有模型融合方法难以有效处理多任务场景下的性能保持问题。

Method: 利用Jensen-Shannon散度指导模型融合过程，自动平衡任务重要性，无需额外标注数据即可实现多任务模型的合并。

Result: 该方法在任务数量增加时保持鲁棒性，持续优于现有方法，能够在单一模型中维持所有任务的强性能表现。

Conclusion: 提出的基于Jensen-Shannon散度的模型融合方法为多任务学习提供了一种有效解决方案，特别适合处理大规模多任务场景下的模型合并需求。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

Motivation: 虽然EM算法在统计学和机器学习中广泛应用，但传统上被视为不可微分的黑盒，无法在现代学习流程中进行端到端梯度传播，这限制了其在深度学习中的应用。

Method: 提出并比较了多种EM算法的微分策略，包括完全自动微分和近似方法，评估了它们的准确性和计算效率。将可微分EM应用于高斯混合模型的Wasserstein距离计算，并提出了新的稳定性理论和不平衡变体。

Conclusion: 可微分EM算法成功解决了传统EM无法集成到现代学习流程的问题，为高斯混合模型的Wasserstein距离计算提供了实用的可微分损失函数，在多个应用场景中展现出良好性能。

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

Conclusion: HiGraph数据集填补了层次化图数据集的空白，为构建鲁棒的恶意软件检测器提供了重要资源，数据集和工具已公开可用

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical
structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single
level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between
high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset
for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs)
nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level
representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust
detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate
HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a
foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with

aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau

\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic

dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in
communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management,
recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our work extends classical bandit

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$
computational efficiency gains.

Conclusion: 主动因果学习为IT系统的自动化管理提供了一种有效的在线因果模型识别方法，解决了传统专家方法的局限性，适用于复杂动态的现代IT系统。

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

TL;DR: Conditional-$t^3$VAE通过为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验分布，解决了VAE在类别不平衡数据集上潜在空间分配不均的问题，显著提高了生成公平性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE及其变体$t^3$VAE在类别不平衡数据集上，潜在空间分配与训练集类别频率成正比，导致尾部类别代表性不足，生成公平性降低。

Method: 提出Conditional-$t^3$VAE模型，为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验分布，防止多数类别主导。使用γ-power散度推导的闭式目标进行优化，并推导等权重潜在混合Student's t分布用于类别平衡生成。

Result: 在SVHN-LT、CIFAR100-LT和CelebA数据集上，Conditional-$t^3$VAE始终获得比$t^3$VAE和高斯基VAE基线更低的FID分数，特别是在严重类别不平衡情况下。在每类F1评估中也优于条件高斯VAE。

Conclusion: 在轻度不平衡情况下（ρ≲3），高斯基模型仍有竞争力，但在更极端的不平衡情况下，Conditional-$t^3$VAE显著提高了生成公平性和多样性。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

TL;DR: DaCe AD是一个无需代码修改的高效自动微分引擎，使用基于ILP的算法优化存储与重计算权衡，在NPBench基准测试中平均比JAX快92倍以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动微分框架存在编程语言支持有限、需要代码修改、科学计算性能不足、存储策略简单等问题，迫使领域科学家手动计算大型问题的梯度

Method: 开发了DaCe AD自动微分引擎，采用基于整数线性规划(ILP)的新算法，在给定内存约束下优化存储与重计算的权衡以达到最佳性能

Result: 在NPBench高性能计算基准测试套件上，DaCe AD平均比当前最先进的通用AD框架JAX快92倍以上，且无需任何代码修改

Conclusion: DaCe AD提供了一个通用高效的自动微分解决方案，解决了现有框架的主要限制，特别适用于科学计算和机器学习集成应用

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing
patterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art
general AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any
code changes.

Motivation: 传统静态基准测试无法捕捉医疗咨询的动态交互特性，导致医疗大语言模型在静态基准和实际临床决策应用之间存在显著差距。

Method: 建立大规模高保真交互式强化学习系统，包含患者模拟器（使用去标识化医疗记录创建真实临床环境）和临床评估生成器（动态生成多维度评估指标），采用改进的Group Relative Policy Optimization算法进行多阶段强化学习训练。

Conclusion: 强大的动态验证系统对于将LLM能力与实际临床应用对齐至关重要，为医疗AI部署建立了性能-参数权衡的新帕累托前沿。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法在多元时间序列预测中可能无法有效建模跨多个时空尺度的依赖关系，需要一种能够联合考虑空间和时间范围的方法。

Method: 提出ST-Hyper模型，包含时空金字塔建模模块提取多尺度特征，自适应超图建模模块学习稀疏超图捕捉高阶依赖，并通过三相超图传播进行特征交互。

Result: 在6个真实世界多元时间序列数据集上的实验表明，ST-Hyper在长短期预测上分别实现了3.8%和6.8%的平均MAE降低，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ST-Hyper通过有效的多尺度时空依赖建模，显著提升了多元时间序列预测的性能，证明了超图建模在捕捉复杂时空动态方面的有效性。

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出UDI方法解决多模态学习中模态不平衡问题，通过顺序训练和动态交互调整，避免传统联合损失的竞争性限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态联合损失会导致模态不平衡，强模态压倒弱模态，限制了各模态个体信息和模态间交互信息的充分利用

Method: UDI方法：先训练锚定模态至收敛，然后用其学习表示通过无监督损失指导其他模态；动态调整模态交互，实现解耦优化和定向信息流

Result: 实验结果表明UDI在处理模态不平衡方面优于现有方法，在多模态学习任务中带来性能提升

Conclusion: UDI通过放弃传统联合损失，采用主动顺序训练方案，有效解决了模态不平衡问题，促进了跨模态特征学习

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架和元算法为学习增强的在线决策提供了灵活且广泛适用的解决方案，在预测质量和鲁棒性之间实现了良好权衡

Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理文本数据的不平衡分类问题，通过结合两类信息扩展特征空间，在严重不平衡场景下表现优异

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

Motivation: 准确评估数据集复杂度对于知识图谱链接预测模型的比较至关重要。CSG指标曾被提出作为数据集复杂度度量，但需要验证其在链接预测任务中的实际表现

Method: 在标准知识图谱链接预测基准上（如FB15k-237、WN18RR等），通过系统改变CSG计算的两个关键参数（M-蒙特卡洛采样点数，K-最近邻数），评估CSG的行为特性

Result: 发现CSG对K参数高度敏感，无法自然随类别数量扩展；CSG值与标准性能指标（如平均倒数排名MRR）相关性弱或无相关性；CSG在链接预测场景中的稳定性和预测能力均失效

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要开发更鲁棒的、分类器无关的复杂度度量方法来进行知识图谱链接预测评估，CSG指标在当前形式下不适合此任务

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Motivation: 随着人工神经网络逐渐成为测量系统的重要组成部分，需要理解它们如何处理和传输参数相关信息，特别是Fisher信息在网络内部的传播过程。

Method: 提出了一种方法来监控Fisher信息在ANN中的流动，从输入层到输出层跟踪信息传输，建立了最优估计性能与Fisher信息最大传输之间的关系。

Result: 研究表明最优估计性能对应于Fisher信息的最大传输，训练超过此点会导致信息损失和过拟合，这提供了一个无需单独验证数据集的模型训练停止准则。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络训练提供了基于Fisher信息的模型自由停止准则，并在实际成像实验数据上验证了其有效性，在现实物理场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM中的专家缓存管理提供了有效的算法解决方案，层感知LRU扩展算法在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

Conclusion: 所提出的非线性镜像映射方法能够有效处理复杂损失几何，在保持理论收敛性的同时，大幅提升了元学习模型的适应效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

Motivation: SAM方法虽然通过寻找平坦最小值来提升泛化能力，但在实践中存在对抗扰动过于友好的问题，限制了泛化性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出VASSO（方差抑制）方法来稳定对抗扰动，通过抑制方差来避免过度友好的对抗样本，可以与SAM及其计算高效变体结合使用。

Result: 在广泛的视觉和语言任务上验证了VASSO+SAM组合的改进泛化能力，同时提供了更好的泛化-计算权衡。

Conclusion: VASSO提供了一种通用的方法来稳定对抗扰动，显著提升了SAM的泛化性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as
disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for
more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models
and analysis as open source to support benchmarking and accelerate progress in
ML-driven power system research.

*Zhenghai Xue,Longtao Zheng,Qian Liu,Yingru Li,Xiaosen Zheng,Zejun Ma,Bo An*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SimpleTIR算法通过过滤无效轮次轨迹来稳定多轮工具集成推理的强化学习训练，解决了分布漂移导致的梯度爆炸问题，在数学推理基准上取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮工具集成推理(TIR)的强化学习训练存在不稳定性和性能崩溃问题，主要原因是外部工具反馈导致的分布漂移和低概率token生成，这些问题在连续轮次中累积导致梯度爆炸。

Method: 提出SimpleTIR算法，核心策略是识别并过滤掉包含无效轮次（既不产生代码块也不产生最终答案的轮次）的轨迹，从策略更新中移除这些有问题的轨迹，从而阻断有害的高幅度梯度。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，将AIME24分数从纯文本基线的22.1提升到50.5（基于Qwen2.5-7B基础模型），并促进了自我修正和交叉验证等多样化推理模式的发现。

Conclusion: SimpleTIR是一种即插即用的算法，通过过滤无效轨迹有效稳定多轮TIR训练，避免了监督微调的限制，使模型能够发现更丰富和复杂的推理模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HydroGAT是一个基于异构图神经网络的时空洪水预测模型，通过高分辨率像素级图结构和自适应注意力机制，在保持水文拓扑信息的同时实现高效训练和准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水预测方法忽略区域拓扑信息，现有GNN方法因计算成本高而采用粗粒度聚合，且时空依赖关系分离处理，无法同时捕捉对准确洪水预测至关重要的时空交互作用。

Method: 构建异质流域图，每个陆地和河流像素作为节点，通过物理水文流向和流域间关系连接；提出HydroGAT时空网络，自适应学习局部时间重要性和最有影响力的上游位置；开发分布式数据并行流水线支持高分辨率训练。

Result: 在美国中西部两个流域和五个基线架构评估中，模型在小时流量预测中达到更高NSE（最高0.97）、改进KGE（最高0.96）和低偏差（PBIAS在±5%内），同时提供可解释的注意力图。分布式训练在64个A100 GPU上实现15倍加速。

Conclusion: HydroGAT通过高分辨率像素级图结构和时空集成建模，在保持水文物理约束的同时实现了准确高效的洪水预测，为水资源管理提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该研究首次探讨循环神经网络(RNN)能否泛化到从LTL公式派生的ω-正则语言，通过在周期性ω词序列上训练RNN来复制目标Büchi自动机行为，并在分布外序列上评估泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Büchi自动机在处理复杂系统行为时面临可扩展性挑战，而神经网络在模型检查等领域被越来越多地用于解决这些挑战，因此需要研究其泛化能力。

Method: 在周期性ω词序列上训练RNN来复制目标Büchi自动机行为，评估其在分布外序列上的泛化性能，实验涵盖从3到100多个状态的确定性自动机。

Result: RNN在比训练示例长8倍的序列上实现了高精度，92.6%的任务实现了完美或接近完美的泛化，表明神经网络能够学习复杂的ω-正则语言。

Conclusion: 这些结果确立了神经网络方法学习复杂ω-正则语言的可行性，表明其作为神经符号验证方法组件的潜力。

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构的大语言视觉模型在部署时面临计算和内存挑战，需要一种能够在准确性和模型大小之间取得平衡的量化方法

Method: 提出MoPEQ混合精度量化算法，使用Hessian迹近似来分析每个专家的敏感性，而不是依赖专家的激活频率，并将相似专家聚类以维持模型性能

Result: 在VLMEvalKit测试集上，使用Deepseek-VL2和MolmoE模型进行实验，混合精度量化的MoE模型在保持竞争力准确性的同时，实现了内存占用的显著改善

Conclusion: MoPEQ算法通过专家级别的精细化控制，为VLM-MoE模型提供了有效的混合精度量化方案，在准确性和内存效率之间取得良好平衡

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

Conclusion: 相比通用强化学习方法，通过监督回归可以实现扩散过程微调，并获得更快的统计速率保证。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a
given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop
a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates
for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity
and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监护模型如LlamaGuard只能检测预定义的静态害害类别，无法满足不同应用域的用户自定义政策需求

Method: 开发动态监护模型，支持用户自定义政策评估，提供快速检测和链式思维推理两种模式，后者能够说明和证明模型输出

Result: 动态监护模型在静态害害类别检测上与静态模型准确性相当，在自由形式政策违规检测上达到前沿推理模型的准确性水平，但耗时更短

Conclusion: 动态监护模型提供了更灵活的内容安全监管方案，能够满足多样化的应用场景需求，在保持高准确性的同时提高效率

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解稀疏自编码器中特征流形（多维特征）如何影响缩放行为，特别是探索是否存在病态的缩放机制。

Method: 采用神经网络缩放文献中的容量分配模型(Brill, 2024)来建模SAE缩放，分析特征流形对缩放规律的影响。

Result: 模型重现了不同的缩放机制，发现在一个特定机制中，特征流形会导致SAE学习的特征数量远少于潜在变量数量，存在病态效应。

Conclusion: 研究提供了关于SAE在现实应用中是否处于这种病态机制的初步讨论，对理解SAE的缩放行为有重要意义。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR), encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality
(AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), is emerging as a transformative platform for
medical education. Traditional methods such as textbooks, physical models, and
cadaveric dissections often lack interactivity and fail to convey complex
spatial relationships effectively. The emerging MR technology addresses these
limitations by providing immersive environments that blend virtual elements
with real-world contexts. This study presents an MR application for head
anatomy education, enabling learners to intuitively interact with see-through
3D anatomical structures via hand gestures and controllers. Our hierarchical
information design supports progressive learning, guiding users from basic
anatomical labels to detailed structural insights. Additionally, the system
incorporates an automatic calibration module that aligns virtual anatomical
models with a real human head, thereby facilitating realistic human-model
interactions. Experiments show that the system can effectively match the
anatomical model with real-time scenes, thus enhancing the interactivity and
immersion of medical education, providing an innovative tool for teaching
anatomy.

Abstract: Data Humanism is a human-centered design approach that emphasizes the
personal, contextual, and imperfect nature of data. Despite its growing
influence among practitioners, the 13 principles outlined in Giorgia Lupi's
visual manifesto remain loosely defined in research contexts, creating a gap
between design practice and systematic application. Through a mixed-methods
approach, including a systematic literature review, multimedia analysis, and
expert interviews, we present a characterization of Data Humanism principles
for visualization researchers. Our characterization provides concrete
definitions that maintain interpretive flexibility in operationalizing design
choices. We validate our work through direct consultation with Lupi. Moreover,
we leverage the characterization to decode a visualization work, mapping Data
Humanism principles to specific visual design choices. Our work creates a
common language for human-centered visualization, bridging the gap between
practice and research for future applications and evaluations.

remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we present Artistic Chatbot, a
voice-to-voice RAG-powered chat system to support informal learning and enhance
visitor engagement during a live art exhibition celebrating the 15th

Poland. The question answering (QA) chatbot responded to free-form spoken
questions in Polish using the context retrieved from a curated, domain-specific

including faculty information, art magazines, books, and journals. We describe
the key aspects of the system architecture and user interaction design, as well
as discuss the practical challenges associated with deploying chatbots at
public cultural sites. Our findings, based on interaction analysis, demonstrate
that chatbots such as Artistic Chatbot effectively maintain responses grounded
in exhibition content (60\% of responses directly relevant), even when faced
with unpredictable queries outside the target domain, showing their potential
for increasing interactivity in public cultural sites.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注事后审核，忽视了在线对话的实时情绪动态以及用户情绪对他人的影响，需要开发实时情绪调节方法来改善在线环境

Method: 1. 基于图的框架识别在线对话中的情绪调节需求；2. 评论排队机制对故意挑衅的评论引入发布延迟，给用户自我调节时间

Result: Twitter和Reddit数据分析显示：图框架减少毒性12%；评论排队机制降低愤怒传播15%，平均仅4%评论被暂时保留

Conclusion: 实时情绪调节与延迟审核相结合能显著改善在线环境福祉，为在线对话管理提供了有效的技术解决方案

Abstract: The pervasiveness of online toxicity, including hate speech and trolling,
disrupts digital interactions and online well-being. Previous research has
mainly focused on post-hoc moderation, overlooking the real-time emotional
dynamics of online conversations and the impact of users' emotions on others.
This paper presents a graph-based framework to identify the need for emotion
regulation within online conversations. This framework promotes self-reflection
to manage emotional responses and encourage responsible behaviour in real time.
Additionally, a comment queuing mechanism is proposed to address intentional
trolls who exploit emotions to inflame conversations. This mechanism introduces
a delay in publishing comments, giving users time to self-regulate before
further engaging in the conversation and helping maintain emotional balance.
Analysis of social media data from Twitter and Reddit demonstrates that the
graph-based framework reduced toxicity by 12%, while the comment queuing
mechanism decreased the spread of anger by 15%, with only 4% of comments being
temporarily held on average. These findings indicate that combining real-time
emotion regulation with delayed moderation can significantly improve well-being
in online environments.

Motivation: 学生过度依赖生成式AI完成作业，虽然节省时间但影响写作和思维能力的发展，需要找到平衡点。

Method: 提出设计需要更多努力的AI工具，如结合生成式AI与传统学习方法（如阅读时记笔），以及增强元认知和反思能力的工具。

Result: 论文初步提出了一些解决方案的构想，但需要进一步研究和验证。

Conclusion: 通过设计需要更多努力的AI工具，可以在保持生成式AI优势的同时，促进学生写作、思维能力和元认知能力的发展，解决努力偏论问题。

Abstract: Students routinely use ChatGPT and the like now to help them with their
homework, such as writing an essay. It takes less effort to complete and is
easier to do than by hand. It can even produce as good if not better output
than the student's own work. However, there is a growing concern that
over-reliance on using GenAI in this way will stifle the development of
learning writing and critical thinking skills. How might this trend be
reversed? What if students were required to make more effort when using GenAI
to do their homework? It might be more challenging, but the additional effort
involved could result in them learning more and having a greater sense of
achievement. This tension can be viewed as a form of effort paradox; where
effort is both viewed as something to be avoided but at the same time is
valued. Is it possible to let students learn sometimes with less and other
times more effort? Students are already adept at the former but what about the
latter? Could we design new kinds of AI tools that deliberately require more
effort to use to deepen the learning experience? In this paper, I begin to
outline what form these might take, for example, asking students to use a
combination of GenAI tools with traditional learning approaches (e.g.
note-taking while reading). I also discuss how else to design tools to think
with that augments human cognition; where students learn more the skills of
metacognition and reflection.

Abstract: Transferring knowledge across generations is fundamental to human
civilization, yet the challenge of passing on complex practical skills
persists. Methods without a physically present instructor, such as videos,
often fail to explain complex manual tasks, where spatial and social factors
are critical. Technologies such as eXtended Reality and Artificial Intelligence
hold the potential to retain expert knowledge and facilitate the creation of
tailored, contextualized, and asynchronous explanations regardless of time and
place. In contrast to videos, the learner's perspective can be different from
the recorded perspective in XR. This paper investigates the impact of
asynchronous first- and third-person perspectives and gaze visualizations on
efficiency, feeling of embodiment, and connectedness during manual tasks. The
empirical results of our study (N=36) show that the first-person perspective is
better in quantitative measures and preferred by users. We identify best
practices for presenting preserved knowledge and provide guidelines for
designing future systems.

surrounding the term ``visualization literacy'', we provide a framework for
operationalizing visualization literacy based on application contexts
(including domain, scenario, and audience) and relevant competencies, which are
categorized under consumption, construction, critique, and connection. Research
contributions are organized into five categories: ontology, assessment,
mechanisms, populiteracy, and intervention. For each category, we identify key
trends, discuss which competencies are addressed, highlight open challenges,
and examine how advancements within these areas inform and reinforce each
other, driving progress in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降维方法难以捕捉真实世界数据（如艺术家作品集、社交媒体历史）随时间变化的语义演变

Method: 结合力导向投影和流式聚类方法，构建嵌入向量的时空地图，实现实时交互式探索

Result: 开发了Chronotome工具，在文本和图像数据上展示了其有效性，为理解时间数据集的美学和语义提供了新视角

Conclusion: 该方法为探索时间数据中的主题演变提供了有效的可视化工具，在多种数据类型上表现出实用价值

Abstract: Many real-world datasets -- from an artist's body of work to a person's
social media history -- exhibit meaningful semantic changes over time that are
difficult to capture with existing dimensionality reduction methods. To address
this gap, we introduce a visualization technique that combines force-based
projection and streaming clustering methods to build a spatial-temporal map of
embeddings. Applying this technique, we create Chronotome, a tool for
interactively exploring evolving themes in time-based data -- in real time. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach through use cases on text and image
data, showing how it offers a new lens for understanding the aesthetics and
semantics of temporal datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可穿戴设备数据工具存在碎片化、专有化和难以访问的问题，阻碍了将大量个人健康信息转化为关于衰老的可操作见解。

Method: 开发了一个Python包，提供从原始数据摄入、预处理到特征计算和生物年龄估计的端到端工作流，支持多种可穿戴设备输入源，并提供基于UK Biobank等大规模数据集训练的模型参数。

Result: 创建了一个开源框架，包括Python包和基于Web的计算器，实现了可重复、透明和可推广的生物年龄估计方法。

Conclusion: CosinorAge通过结合透明可重复的分析和广泛的可访问性，推进了可扩展的个性化健康监测，并连接了数字健康技术与生物衰老研究。

Abstract: Every day, millions of people worldwide track their steps, sleep, and
activity rhythms with smartwatches and fitness trackers. These continuously
collected data streams present a remarkable opportunity to transform routine
self-tracking into meaningful health insights that enable individuals to
understand -- and potentially influence -- their biological aging. Yet most
tools for analyzing wearable data remain fragmented, proprietary, and
inaccessible, creating a major barrier between this vast reservoir of personal
health information and its translation into actionable insights on aging.
CosinorAge is an open-source framework that estimates biological age from
wearable-derived circadian, physical activity, and sleep metrics. It addresses
the lack of unified, reproducible pipelines for jointly analyzing
rest--activity rhythmicity, physical activity, and sleep, and linking them to
health outcomes. The Python package provides an end-to-end workflow from raw
data ingestion and preprocessing to feature computation and biological age
estimation, supporting multiple input sources across wearables and smartwatch.
It also makes available trained model parameters (open weights) derived from
large-scale population datasets such as UK Biobank, enabling reproducibility,
transparency, and generalizability across studies. Its companion web-based
CosinorAge Calculator enables non-technical users to access identical
analytical capabilities through an intuitive interface. By combining
transparent, reproducible analysis with broad accessibility, CosinorAge
advances scalable, personalized health monitoring and bridges digital health
technologies with biological aging research.

Motivation: 个人健康信息系统(PHI)在印度上的采用障碍待解，需要探索印度用户和利益相关者的采用情况和挑战。

Method: 采用多方法研究设计，包括意识调查(n=87)、半结构化访谈(n=22)、利益相关者访谈和共同设计工坊，开发并评估Figma原型。

Result: 研究发现PHI在健康监测和共享养护方面受到重视，但采用受到低健康素养、使用性挑战和数字健康平台不信任等因素的限制。

Conclusion: 研究强调了印度PHI采用的社会技术挑战，并持诉需要可靠、以用户为中心的解决方案来支持主动健康管理。

Abstract: Personal Health Informatics (PHI), which leverages digital tools and
information systems to support health assessment and self-care, holds promise
for empowering individuals and transforming healthcare delivery. However,
barriers to its adoption remain underexplored in the Indian context. This study
investigates PHI adoption among Indian users and stakeholders using a
multi-method approach. An awareness survey (n = 87) examined the usage of
wearables and general PHI engagement, followed by semi-structured interviews (n
= 22) that explored motivations, usage patterns, and health information
sources. Qualitative analysis revealed that while PHI is valued for health
monitoring and shared/collective care, its adoption is hindered by factors such
as low health literacy, usability challenges, and mistrust in digital health
platforms. Further stakeholder interviews and co-design workshops informed the
development of a Figma-based prototype, which was evaluated for usability.
Based on these findings, we offer design recommendations for an integrated,
user-controlled PHI platform featuring accessible analytics and verifiable
health information. Our insights highlight the socio-technical challenges of
PHI adoption in India and underscore the need for reliable, user-centric
solutions to support proactive healthcare.

Abstract: Promoting public health is challenging owing to its abstract nature, and
individuals may be apprehensive about confronting it. Recently, there has been
an increasing interest in using the metaverse and gamification as novel
educational techniques to improve learning experiences related to the immune
system. Thus, we present MetaRoundWorm, an immersive virtual reality (VR)
escape room game designed to enhance the understanding of parasitic infections
and host immune responses through interactive, gamified learning. The
application simulates the lifecycle of Ascaris lumbricoides and corresponding
immunological mechanisms across anatomically accurate environments within the
human body. Integrating serious game mechanics with embodied learning
principles, MetaRoundWorm offers players a task-driven experience combining
exploration, puzzle-solving, and immune system simulation. To evaluate the
educational efficacy and user engagement, we conducted a controlled study
comparing MetaRoundWorm against a traditional approach, i.e., interactive
slides. Results indicate that MetaRoundWorm significantly improves immediate
learning outcomes, cognitive engagement, and emotional experience, while
maintaining knowledge retention over time. Our findings suggest that immersive
VR gamification holds promise as an effective pedagogical tool for
communicating complex biomedical concepts and advancing digital health
education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动互联网时代信息过载，现有注意力感知系统依赖可穿戴设备或个性化数据，限制了可扩展性和跨场景适应性。需要开发不依赖复杂主观输入的注意力感知模型。

Method: 设计结合主观和客观数据的现场研究框架，构建细粒度可解释数据集，分析用户响应行为、响应动机、上下文信息和注意力状态的关系，提出基于非隐私敏感客观数据的轻量级AttenTrack模型。

Result: 构建了以当前上下文-外部干扰-主观注意力关系为中心的数据集，开发了具有强冷启动能力的隐私友好型注意力感知模型，可应用于多种注意力管理任务。

Conclusion: AttenTrack模型通过自然发生的移动通知作为外部干扰源，仅使用移动设备上的非隐私敏感数据就能有效推断用户注意力状态，为移动注意力感知领域提供了新的解决方案和数据集支持。

Abstract: In the mobile internet era, managing limited attention amid information
overload is crucial for enhancing collaboration and information delivery.
However, current attention-aware systems often depend on wearables or
personalized data, limiting their scalability and cross-context adaptability.
Inspired by psychological theories, we attempt to treat mobile notifications as
naturally occurring external distractions and infer users' attention states
based on their response behaviors and contextual information. Our goal is to
build an attention-aware model that does not rely on personalized historical
data or complex subjective input, while ensuring strong cold-start capability
and cross-context adaptability. To this end, We design a field study framework
integrating subjective and objective data, closely aligned with real-world
external distractions (i.e., mobile notifications). Through field studies, we
construct a fine-grained and interpretable dataset centered on the relationship
among current context - external distractions - subjective attention. Through
our field studies, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the relationships among
users' response behaviors, response motivations, contextual information, and
attention states. Building on our findings, we propose AttenTrack, a
lightweight, privacy-friendly attention awareness model with strong cold-start
capability. The model relies solely on non-privacy-sensitive objective data
available on mobile devices, and can be applied to a variety of attention
management tasks. In addition, we will publicly release the constructed dataset
to support future research and advance the field of mobile attention awareness.

TL;DR: 使用脑电图（EEG）和事件相关电位（ERPs）测量虚拟现实中的临场感，通过设计沉浸式射击游戏和操控临场感中断来验证N2、P3b和N400成分对临场感测量的敏感性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统问卷测量VR临场感会中断体验且依赖回顾性报告，EEG可能提供无干扰的实时测量方法，但先前研究在操控临场感、验证测量、区分注意力和临场感等方面存在不足

Method: 预注册ERP实验，参与者在VR中玩目标射击游戏，通过冻结弹弓释放球来诱导临场感中断，操控具身条件（真实化身体验vs控制器操作），分析N2、P3b和N400等ERP成分

Result: 研究发现N2、P3b和N400成分对这些操控表现出选择性敏感，支持这些ERP成分作为临场感测量的有效指标

Conclusion: 该研究为临场感理论提供了重要的神经生理学证据，解决了先前ERP研究中很少涉及的理论问题，证明了EEG作为无干扰临场感测量工具的潜力

Abstract: Presence in virtual reality (VR), the subjective sense of "being there" in a
virtual environment, is notoriously difficult to measure.
Electroencephalography (EEG) may offer a promising, unobtrusive means of
assessing a user's momentary state of presence. Unlike traditional
questionnaires, EEG does not interrupt the experience or rely on users'
retrospective self-reports, thereby avoiding interference with the very state
it aims to capture. Previous research has attempted to quantify presence in
virtual environments using event-related potentials (ERPs). We contend,
however, that previous efforts have fallen short of fully realizing this goal,
failing to either A) independently manipulate presence, B) validate their
measure of presence against traditional techniques, C) adequately separate the
constructs of presence and attention, and/or D) implement a realistic and
immersive environment and task. We address these shortcomings in a
preregistered ERP experiment in which participants play an engaging target
shooting game in VR. ERPs are time-locked to the release of a ball from a
sling. We induce breaks in presence (BIPs) by freezing the ball's release on a
minority of trials. Embodiment is manipulated by allowing manual manipulation
of the sling with a realistic avatar in one condition (embodied condition) and
passive manipulation with only controllers in another (non-embodied condition).
We support our predictions that the N2, the P3b, and the N400, are selectively
sensitive towards specific components of these manipulations. The pattern of
findings carries significant implications for theories of presence, which have
been seldom addressed in previous ERP investigations on this topic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实原子性定义不够明确，导致人工和模型标注者之间存在高度分歧，影响了LLM输出事实性评估的可靠性。

Method: 采用可视化分析概念，通过可视化语义对齐、粒度和引用依赖关系来暴露标注不一致性，并通过引导式修订循环促进标注收敛。

Result: 该方法能够系统性地检查提取的事实，为事实性评估基准建立更稳定的基础。

Conclusion: 该可视化分析方法有助于改善LLM评估，通过解决事实分解中的模糊性问题来提高事实性评估的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Factuality evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs requires
decomposing text into discrete "atomic" facts. However, existing definitions of
atomicity are underspecified, with empirical results showing high disagreement
among annotators, both human and model-based, due to unresolved ambiguity in
fact decomposition. We present a visual analytics concept to expose and analyze
annotation inconsistencies in fact extraction. By visualizing semantic
alignment, granularity and referential dependencies, our approach aims to
enable systematic inspection of extracted facts and facilitate convergence
through guided revision loops, establishing a more stable foundation for
factuality evaluation benchmarks and improving LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文研究了热感知错觉在虚拟现实中的应用，通过心理物理学实验发现视听线索能产生主观温度感知变化，但实际温度偏移效果较小（±0.5°C），且与主观评分不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚拟现实系统缺乏有效的热感知模拟，硬件方案笨重且耗电。热感知错觉通过跨模态交互提供温度体验，但其对实际感知温度的影响程度尚未被量化研究。

Method: 采用两个用户研究：首先对20种视听线索进行排序和量化，然后在24名参与者中测试这些线索单独和组合使用时对物理温度变化的抵消效果。

Result: 热感知错觉能显著改变主观判断，听觉线索可作为视觉技术的替代或补充。但实际诱导的温度变化较小（±0.5°C），且与抽象评分不一致。

Conclusion: 未来热感知错觉的设计和评估需要重新考虑，因为实际效果有限且与主观感受存在差异。

Abstract: Thermal sensations are central to how we experience the world, yet most
virtual and extended reality systems fail to simulate them effectively. While
hardware-based thermal displays can provide accurate temperature changes, they
are often bulky, power-intensive, and restrict user mobility. Consequently,
recent works have explored thermal illusions, perceptual effects that rely on
cross-modal interactions, to achieve thermal experiences without physical
heating or cooling. While thermal illusions have been shown to consistently
alter subjective ratings, the actual extent of their effect on the perceived
temperature of interacted objects remains unexplored. To address this, we
contribute the findings of two user studies following psychophysical
procedures. We first ordered and scaled the effects of a variety of visual and
auditory cues (N=20) and subsequently quantified their isolated and combined
efficacy in offsetting physical temperature changes (N=24). We found that
thermal illusions elicited robust changes in subjective judgments, and auditory
cues showed potential as an alternative or complementary approach to
established visual techniques. However, the actual effects induced by thermal
illusions were relatively small (+-0.5{\deg}C) and did not consistently align
with abstract ratings, suggesting a need to reconsider how future thermal
illusions or experiences are designed and evaluated.

Abstract: Monitoring vegetation dynamics is crucial for addressing global environmental
challenges like degradation and deforestation, but traditional remote sensing
methods are often complex and resource-intensive. To overcome these barriers,
we developed an interactive, cloud-based application on the Google Earth Engine
(GEE) platform for few clicks on-demand global vegetation analysis without
complex technical knowledge. The application automates the calculation of
vegetated areas using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived
from Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. It utilizes a median composite of images
over a selected period to create a single, robust, cloud-free image, minimizing
atmospheric noise and other artifacts. It offers a flexible, global multi-scale
analytical platform, allowing users to define regions of interest based on
administrative boundaries, protected areas, or custom-drawn polygons. The
user-friendly interface enables the selection of specific time periods and NDVI
thresholds to quantify vegetation cover in real time, eliminating the need for
manual and time intensive data handling and processing. A validation of the
platform was conducted for two protected areas in Bangladesh which demonstrated
high accuracy, with area estimates showing over 97% agreement with published
reference data. By simplifying access to powerful geospatial analytics to
general people, this tool provides a scalable and practical solution for
researchers, land managers, policymakers, and any interested person to monitor
vegetation trends, support conservation efforts, to inform decision making in
spatial context where policy maker need to use insights in few clicks and
inform environmental policy.

Motivation: AR/VR体验中，用户的手臂和手部提供了便捷的触觉输入表面。相比目前常见的空中界面，身体输入具有速度、准确性和人体工程学方面的显著优势，但缺乏稳健实用的方法。

Method: 仅使用XR头显中已集成的RGB摄像头，开发了裸手皮肤输入技术，无需对用户进行特殊仪器化。

Result: 该方法在不同光照条件、肤色和身体运动（如行走时输入）下都能保持高准确性和鲁棒性，同时提供丰富的输入元数据包括触摸力度、手指识别、攻击角度和旋转信息。

Conclusion: 这项技术为HCI文献中已有充分理论支持但缺乏实用方法的皮肤界面提供了必要的技术基础，有望完全解锁皮肤输入界面的潜力。

Abstract: In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands
can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has
shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits
over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate
high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin
input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern
XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across
diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while
walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including
touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe
these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin
interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked
robust and practical methods.

Method: 创建基于人本主义疗法的多模态数据集，包含多维标注的言语-视觉不一致性检测，以及参与度评分的行为标注

Result: 使用该数据集训练的视觉语言模型在共情和治疗对话质量方面显著提升，在维持治疗参与度、减少人工化语言模式等方面优于通用模型

Conclusion: E-THER数据集为训练真正具有共情能力的AI系统提供了重要基础，基于不一致性训练的模型在治疗性对话中表现更优

Abstract: A prevalent shortfall among current empathic AI systems is their inability to
recognize when verbal expressions may not fully reflect underlying emotional
states. This is because the existing datasets, used for the training of these
systems, focus on surface-level emotion recognition without addressing the
complex verbal-visual incongruence (mismatch) patterns useful for empathic
understanding. In this paper, we present E-THER, the first Person-Centered
Therapy-grounded multimodal dataset with multidimensional annotations for
verbal-visual incongruence detection, enabling training of AI systems that
develop genuine rather than performative empathic capabilities. The annotations
included in the dataset are drawn from humanistic approach, i.e., identifying
verbal-visual emotional misalignment in client-counsellor interactions -
forming a framework for training and evaluating AI on empathy tasks. Additional
engagement scores provide behavioral annotations for research applications.
Notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities are observed
in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as IDEFICS and
VideoLLAVA, using evaluation metrics grounded in empathic and therapeutic
principles. Empirical findings indicate that our incongruence-trained models
outperform general-purpose models in critical traits, such as sustaining
therapeutic engagement, minimizing artificial or exaggerated linguistic
patterns, and maintaining fidelity to PCT theoretical framework.

Abstract: Shared control is a form of video gaming accessibility support that allows
players with disabilities to delegate inaccessible controls to another person.
Through interviews involving 14 individuals with lived experience of accessible
gaming in shared control, we explore the ways in which shared control
technologies are adopted in practice, the accessibility challenges they
address, and how the support currently provided in shared control can be
automated to remove the need for a human assistant. Findings indicate that
shared control is essential for enabling access to otherwise inaccessible
games, but its reliance on human support is a key limitation. Participants
welcomed the idea of automating the support with software agents, while also
identifying limitations and design requirements. Accordingly, this work
contributes insights into current practices and proposes guidelines for
developing automated support systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个关于人工智能代理（如聊天机器人和社交机器人）提供心理治疗时变化过程的理论框架，分析了人类治疗师与AI代理在治疗过程中的关键差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的推出，人工智能代理能否替代人类治疗师的问题备受关注，但目前对AI代理提供心理治疗的变化过程了解甚少，需要理论框架来促进假设发展和科学讨论。

Method: 通过概念分析，研究人类治疗师存在的关键活性成分，提出人类治疗师的存在论地位（作为人类）和社会文化地位（作为社会认可的医疗专业人员）在促进治疗效果中的重要作用。

Result: 提出了"真实性差距"和"可信度差距"的概念，指出在缺乏人类治疗师的存在论和社会文化地位时，这些差距会削弱心理治疗的关键变化过程。

Conclusion: 需要科学研究和实际应用来分别利用人工智能代理和人类治疗师的优势，同时认识到人工智能代理复杂的代理性质使得建立普遍适用的变化过程命题变得复杂。

Abstract: The question of whether artificial agents (e.g., chatbots and social robots)
can replace human therapists has received notable attention following the
recent launch of large language models. However, little is known about the
processes of change in psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. To
facilitate hypothesis development and stimulate scientific debate, the present
article offers the first theoretical framework of the processes of change in
psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. The theoretical framework rests
upon a conceptual analysis of what active ingredients may be inherently linked
to the presence of human therapists. We propose that human therapists'
ontological status as human beings and sociocultural status as socially
sanctioned healthcare professionals play crucial roles in promoting treatment
outcomes. In the absence of the ontological and sociocultural status of human
therapists, we propose what we coin the genuineness gap and credibility gap can
emerge and undermine key processes of change in psychotherapy. Based on these
propositions, we propose avenues for scientific investigations and practical
applications aimed at leveraging the strengths of artificial agents and human
therapists respectively. We also highlight the intricate agentic nature of
artificial agents and discuss how this complicates endeavors to establish
universally applicable propositions regarding the processes of change in these
interventions.

Result: 提出了AI应用开发的技术建议（如高质量数据需求、人类专业知识整合）和心理研究问题（如接受度、开放性和信任）

Conclusion: 工作场所AI应用需要同时考虑技术因素和心理因素，高质量数据和人类专业知识整合对学习型系统至关重要，用户心理接受度是未来研究重点

Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of technological and psychological
factors of applying artificial intelligence (AI) at the work place. We do so
for a number of twelve application cases in the context of a project where AI
is integrated at work places and in work systems of the future. From a
technological point of view we mainly look at the areas of AI that the
applications are concerned with. This allows to formulate recommendations in
terms of what to look at in developing an AI application and what to pay
attention to with regards to building AI literacy with different stakeholders
using the system. This includes the importance of high-quality data for
training learning-based systems as well as the integration of human expertise,
especially with knowledge-based systems. In terms of the psychological factors
we derive research questions to investigate in the development of AI supported
work systems and to consider in future work, mainly concerned with topics such
as acceptance, openness, and trust in an AI system.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Talking Spell是一个可穿戴系统，允许用户通过辐射网络为日常物品赋予语音和拟人化角色，解决了现有AI伴侣需要用户与陌生物品建立情感连接的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟助手通常嵌入特定设备中，要求用户与陌生物品建立情感连接，这会导致参与度降低和疏离感。需要一种方法让用户能够与自己熟悉的日常物品建立情感连接。

Method: 开发了Talking Spell系统，结合计算机视觉(YOLOv11)、大型视觉语言模型(QWEN-VL)、语音转文本和文本转语音技术，通过三个阶段(相识、熟悉、绑定)引导用户建立情感连接。

Result: 通过12名参与者的用户研究验证了系统在娱乐、陪伴、实用和创意四种交互意图中的有效性，证明其能够促进与日常物品的有意义互动和情感意义。

Conclusion: Talking Spell成功创建了引人入胜的个性化体验，让用户能够与自己选择的日常物品建立深厚的情感连接，从配饰到必需穿戴设备都适用。

Abstract: Virtual assistants (VAs) have become ubiquitous in daily life, integrated
into smartphones and smart devices, sparking interest in AI companions that
enhance user experiences and foster emotional connections. However, existing
companions are often embedded in specific objects-such as glasses, home
assistants, or dolls-requiring users to form emotional bonds with unfamiliar
items, which can lead to reduced engagement and feelings of detachment. To
address this, we introduce Talking Spell, a wearable system that empowers users
to imbue any everyday object with speech and anthropomorphic personas through a
user-centric radiative network. Leveraging advanced computer vision (e.g.,
YOLOv11 for object detection), large vision-language models (e.g., QWEN-VL for
persona generation), speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies, Talking
Spell guides users through three stages of emotional connection: acquaintance,
familiarization, and bonding. We validated our system through a user study
involving 12 participants, utilizing Talking Spell to explore four interaction
intentions: entertainment, companionship, utility, and creativity. The results
demonstrate its effectiveness in fostering meaningful interactions and
emotional significance with everyday objects. Our findings indicate that
Talking Spell creates engaging and personalized experiences, as demonstrated
through various devices, ranging from accessories to essential wearables.

Motivation: 先天性心脏病儿童需要从早期理解复杂医疗信息以支持终身护理，但现有研究很少让年幼儿童参与数字健康工具的设计评估。

Method: 采用多阶段研究，包括参与式设计、用户测试和迭代开发，通过隐喻游戏介绍心脏解剖和健康习惯，对30名儿童进行用户测试。

Result: 研究发现了可用性、参与度和理解度的积极结果，揭示了通过严肃游戏原则支持健康素养的设计机会。

Conclusion: 研究结果为下一阶段在家庭和临床环境中的进一步测试、优化和部署提供了指导。

Abstract: Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) often face challenges that
require them to understand complex medical information from an early age in
order to support lifelong care and improve health outcomes. However, prior
research has rarely included young children in designing and evaluating digital
tools to support health education using developmentally appropriate strategies.
This study is part of a multi-phase research involving participatory design
(PD), user testing, and iterative development. We present the design and
refinement of a digital application that introduces basic information about
CHD, including heart anatomy and healthy habits, through metaphor-based
gameplay. User testing sessions with 30 children informed the redesign of
interactive activities aligned with specific health conditions. Findings
highlight usability, engagement, and comprehension outcomes and reveal design
opportunities for supporting health literacy through serious game (SG)
principles. These results inform the next phase, including further testing,
refinement, and deployment in home and clinical settings.

TL;DR: 本文对四种口吃检测模型(YOLO-Stutter、FluentNet、UDM、SSDM)进行了系统性比较分析，从性能、可控性和可解释性三个维度评估，发现UDM在准确性和临床可解释性方面达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然口吃检测模型在基准数据集上的性能不断提升，但临床采用不仅需要准确性，还需要模型具有可控性和可解释性。

Method: 通过在多数据集上的综合评估和临床专家评估，系统比较四种代表性方法。

Result: YOLO-Stutter和FluentNet提供效率和简单性但透明度有限；UDM实现准确性和临床可解释性的最佳平衡；SSDM在实验中无法完全复现。

Conclusion: 分析揭示了不同方法之间的权衡关系，为临床可行的口吃建模指明了未来方向，并提供了详细的实施见解和实际部署考虑。

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

TL;DR: 本研究通过从arXiv论文合成研究级QA问题来评估大语言模型的数据污染问题，发现模型在知识截止日期前后性能没有显著衰减，表明多步推理合成方法能有效缓解基准污染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力评估日益受到数据污染问题的困扰，需要开发新方法来区分真正的推理能力和单纯的记忆能力。

Method: 利用arXiv论文的自然时间结构，从20,277篇论文中合成1,643个多步推理问题，覆盖知识截止日期前后26个月的时间跨度，评估4个前沿模型。

Result: 结果显示不同规模、开发者和发布日期的模型在知识截止日期附近均未出现显著性能衰减，与之前基于公开数据的研究结果形成对比。

Conclusion: 多步推理合成方法提供了超越浅层记忆的复杂性，是构建抗污染基准的有效策略，建议优先采用推理驱动的合成方法而非简单收集新问题。

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

Motivation: 研究人类如何整合他人语言指导和直接经验进行安全快速学习，并探索AI系统如何实现类似的社会学习能力，以促进人机协作学习。

Method: 开发计算框架，将预训练语言模型转化为概率模型，模拟人类基于信念分享建议的过程，通过贝叶斯推理整合感觉运动数据和语言输入，在10款视频游戏中进行行为实验和模拟。

Result: 语言指导能够塑造探索行为、加速学习过程，减少风险交互并加快关键发现，实现了跨代知识积累和成功的人机知识传递。

Conclusion: 结构化、与语言兼容的表征能够实现人机协作学习，为社会学习和AI系统开发提供了新的计算框架和实证基础。

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

Motivation: 比较LLM假设搜索与直接程序生成在归纳推理任务中的性能差异，探索如何更好地模拟人类从有限示例中推断抽象规则的能力

Method: 使用LLM假设搜索框架和直接程序生成方法在少样本规则归纳任务上进行对比实验，并进行错误分析

Result: 假设搜索方法达到与人类相当的性能水平，直接程序生成方法表现明显落后，错误分析揭示了假设生成的关键瓶颈

Conclusion: LLM假设搜索在建模归纳推理方面具有潜力，但需要解决假设生成效率问题以构建更有效的系统

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited
examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an
LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches
on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search
achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation
falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis
generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods.
Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search
for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient
systems.

TL;DR: 一种基于低代价低延迟的不确定性指导精细化循环方法，通过分析token级别不确定性来触发针对性修改，在保持质量的同时大幅降低成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决理由模型成本高、延迟大的问题，寻找一种在质量和成本之间的平衡方案

Method: 使用token级别上的不确定性指标（混淆度、最大token熵、低信心度token计数）触发针对性精细化，将系统不确定性报告传回模型指导修改

Result: 小模型配备此循环可达到理由模型95%的质量，仅需三分之一成本，准确率提半16%个百分点，只需对31%的响应进行精细化

Conclusion: 该方法提供了单次推理和豆子理由链之间的有效平衡方案，适合对质量和成本都有要求的生产环境部署

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过赋予AI代理不同准确度的情绪分类器，探讨情绪感知准确性对群体情感行为和空间组织的影响，发现低准确度分类器会导致信任降低、情感分裂和社会混乱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类检测和响应他人情绪的能力对社会行为至关重要，研究旨在探索情绪感知准确性如何影响群体层面的情感和空间行为。

Method: 在2D环形网格上创建代理，使用KDEF人脸照片，赋予三种不同准确度的情绪分类器（基于JAFFE、CK+、KDEF数据集训练）。代理基于感知到的邻居情绪状态进行移动（趋近积极情绪，远离消极情绪），并在同质/异质群体和情绪冲击场景下进行实验。

Result: 低准确度分类器导致信任降低、情感分裂为悲伤、社会组织混乱；高准确度分类器形成坚韧的情感集群和对情绪干扰的韧性；即使在情绪中性场景中，误感知也足以产生隔离和凝聚力瓦解。

Conclusion: 情绪识别中的偏见或不精确可能显著扭曲社会过程并破坏情感整合，强调了准确情绪感知对社会凝聚力的重要性。

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在重要决策中扮演更大角色，需要确保其与人类价值观对齐。依赖专有API限制了研究的可复现性和广泛参与，因此研究本地开源模型的集成辩论方法

Method: 使用本地开源模型进行集成辩论，在15个不同场景下进行了150场辩论实验，比较了五种集成配置与单模型基线的表现

Result: 集成方法在7点评分标准上整体表现更优（3.48 vs 3.13），推理深度提升19.4%，论证质量提升34.1%，在真实性和人类增强方面改善最明显（分别+1.25和+0.80分）

outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human

### [507] [MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00100)
*Rahul Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MODE是一种轻量级的检索增强生成方法，用聚类路由检索替代精细的最近邻搜索，适用于小型领域特定语料库，在保持低延迟的同时匹配或超越密集检索基线的答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索增强生成方法依赖大型向量数据库和针对大规模语料库优化的交叉编码器，这对于小型、领域特定的文档集合来说过于复杂和资源密集。

Method: 将文档嵌入后分组到语义连贯的聚类中，用缓存质心表示。查询时路由到顶部质心，仅在这些聚类内检索上下文，无需外部向量数据库基础设施和重排序。

Result: 在100-500个文本块的HotpotQA和SQuAD语料库上，MODE在答案质量上匹配或超越密集检索基线，同时减少了端到端检索时间。聚类粒度和多聚类路由控制召回/精确度权衡。

Conclusion: MODE为中小型语料库提供了一个实用的解决方案，特别适用于注重简单性、速度和主题聚焦的场景。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自适应多维监控(AMDM)算法，用于改进多智能体AI系统的评估，通过标准化异构指标和应用动态阈值来减少异常检测延迟和误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体AI系统评估过于依赖技术指标，缺乏对人类中心和经济维度的考量，需要更全面的监控框架来确保系统在真实世界部署中的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 开发了AMDM算法，包括：1)标准化异构指标；2)应用每轴指数加权移动平均阈值；3)通过马哈拉诺比斯距离进行联合异常检测。

Result: AMDM将异常检测延迟从12.3秒减少到5.6秒，误报率从4.5%降低到0.9%，相比静态阈值有显著改进。

Conclusion: AMDM算法为多智能体AI系统提供了更有效和全面的监控方案，有助于在实际部署中更好地检测和预防系统异常行为。

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是扩展个体层面的证据基础信念和易错知识到群体层面，建立形式化的群体知识和群体信念理论框架。

Method: 采用拓扑语义方法，将个体证据模型扩展到多智能体系统，构建群体证据逻辑，并引入动态证据共享算子进行扩展。

Result: 完全公理化了群体证据逻辑（包括硬证据和软证据），证明了其可判定性，特别对群体知识和群体信念片段进行了完整处理，并证明动态扩展与静态基础具有相同的表达能力。

Conclusion: 成功建立了群体证据逻辑的完整理论框架，证明了群体知识和群体信念的形式化处理可行性，动态证据共享操作不会增加逻辑的表达能力。

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

Conclusion: DACE的自适应方法能够在不牺牲精度的前提下促进有效探索，验证了基于自信心调节的RL算法的有效性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

TL;DR: HiVA是一个分层变量代理框架，通过语义-拓扑进化算法将代理工作流建模为自组织图，解决了现有方法在环境适应性方面的权衡问题，在多个基准测试中实现了5-10%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主代理系统面临关键权衡：固定工作流需要手动重新配置以适应环境变化，而灵活的反应循环无法将推理进展转化为可转移的结构。需要一种既能适应环境变化又能保持结构可重用性的方法。

Method: 提出HiVA框架，使用语义-拓扑进化(STEV)算法将代理工作流建模为自组织图。该算法通过文本梯度作为离散域的反向传播替代品，在混合语义-拓扑空间中进行优化。包含多臂老虎机前向路由、环境反馈生成诊断梯度、以及协调更新等迭代过程。

Conclusion: HiVA框架通过自组织图建模和语义-拓扑协同进化，在未知环境中有效实现了自主任务执行，解决了现有方法的适应性与可重用性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

Motivation: 埃塞俄比亚卫生部需要优化有限的医疗预算分配，以扩大基本医疗服务覆盖范围，但面临年度预算限制和竞争优先事项的挑战

Method: 开发HARP工具，采用原则性决策支持优化框架，提出两种算法：学习增强方法改进专家建议，贪婪算法用于多步规划，均具有强最坏情况近似估计

Result: 与埃塞俄比亚公共卫生研究所和卫生部合作，在三个地区的多种规划场景中验证了方法的实证效果

Conclusion: HARP工具为医疗资源规划提供了有效的优化框架，能够在预算不确定的情况下最大化人口覆盖并满足区域公平性要求

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

Motivation: MCCFR与深度神经网络结合时面临规模依赖的挑战，如非平稳目标分布偏移、方差爆炸等问题在不同规模博弈中表现不同，需要针对性的缓解策略。

Method: 提出Robust Deep MCCFR框架，包含延迟更新的目标网络、均匀探索混合、方差感知训练目标和全面诊断监控，通过系统消融研究验证组件有效性。

Result: 在Kuhn扑克上达到0.0628的最终利用度（比经典框架提升60%），在Leduc扑克上达到0.2386利用度（提升23.5%），证明了选择性组件使用的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经MCCFR组件的规模依赖性交互作用，提供了理论风险分析、有收敛保证的缓解框架，并为更大规模博弈部署提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILWS通过指令级权重塑形技术，让LLM能够通过会话反馈和反思动态更新指令空间，然后将成熟的改进蒸馏到权重空间，实现知识持续进化而无需停机


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM静态知识更新问题，避免RAG的高延迟和工程开销、提示工程的脆弱性以及微调的高成本和灾难性遗忘

Method: 使用反思引擎分析会话轨迹，提出指令、用户偏好和工具的增量更新，通过版本控制和评分评估，在编辑预算达到阈值时将指令空间改进蒸馏到参数空间

Result: 在企业支持中吞吐量提升2.4-5.0倍，幻觉减少约80%；在Adobe Commerce Cloud中每小时处理工单数提升4-5倍，单工单时间降低约80%

Conclusion: ILWS在指令层操作直到受控蒸馏，适用于需要自适应推理、工具创建和低延迟部署的动态领域，如法律、医疗和工程

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

Method: 将BRaP形式定义为图搜索问题，提出4种搜索基于的算法：联合配置空间搜索、经典规划、多代理路径规划和专家启发式算法

Result: 算法尽管面对搜索空间与块数指数关系，但在80x80网格中仍能高效为深藏块生成重新排列计划

Conclusion: 提出的搜索算法能够有效解决大规模库存管理中的块重新排列问题，显示了良好的规划质量和可扩展性

Abstract: We introduce the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP), a challenging component
of large warehouse management which involves rearranging storage blocks within
dense grids to achieve a target state. We formally define the BRaP as a graph
search problem. Building on intuitions from sliding puzzle problems, we propose
five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply
buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.

TL;DR: SHERPA是一个模型驱动框架，通过将领域特定最佳实践融入分层状态机来提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现，实现更细粒度的行为控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型(LLM)能力强大，但缺乏结构化推理能力，特别是在需要领域特定最佳实践的复杂任务中。现有的多步提示方法缺乏通用机制来控制LLM行为。

Method: 提出SHERPA框架，使用分层状态机结构化LLM执行过程，通过基于规则或机器学习(包括LLM)的决策来实现细粒度行为控制。

Result: 在代码生成、类名生成和问答等多种任务中，SHERPA不仅复现了先前方法，还进一步提升了性能。系统评估显示，精心设计的状态机显著提高了LLM输出质量。

Conclusion: SHERPA特别适用于具有完善人类最佳实践但缺乏训练数据的复杂任务，通过状态机集成有效提升了LLM的表现。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商平台中产品列表缺乏明确标识符且名称差异大，传统基于规则和关键词相似度的方法容易忽略品牌、规格等细微差异而导致误分类，需要更可靠的SKU映射解决方案。

Method: 提出Q2K多智能体框架：1）推理代理生成针对性消歧问题；2）知识代理通过聚焦网络搜索解决问题；3）去重代理重用已验证推理痕迹减少冗余；4）人工介入机制精炼不确定案例。

Result: 在真实消费品数据集上的实验表明，Q2K超越了强基线方法，在捆绑识别和品牌来源消歧等困难场景中实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过重用检索推理而非重复搜索，Q2K在准确性和效率之间取得平衡，为产品集成提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代城市拥有大量多模态传感器数据，但这些数据分散且难以整合，需要人工推理来识别事件与多模态数据之间的关系。传统方法依赖人工编码规则，效率低下且难以扩展。

Method: 使用大语言模型生成必要的世界知识，识别城市空间事件与多模态数据之间的关系，将组织化的知识表示为知识图谱，整合事件、观察结果等信息。

Result: 系统能够合理连接5种不同数据源（新闻文本、监控图像、空气质量、天气和交通测量）与同时同地发生的相关事件。

Conclusion: SIGMUS系统成功实现了多模态城市数据的自动语义集成，证明了LLMs在识别复杂城市事件与多源数据关系方面的有效性，为城市事件分析和预测提供了新方法。

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 操作系统调度器存在语义鸿沟问题，内核策略无法理解应用特定需求，导致性能不佳

Method: 采用MCP服务器架构，提供工作负载分析引擎、调度策略库和执行验证器，通过多代理系统分析工作负载并合成eBPF调度策略

Result: 实现最高1.79倍性能改进，相比简单代理方法成本降低13倍，同时保持高成功率

Conclusion: SchedCP通过弥合语义鸿沟，实现了专家级系统优化的民主化，是迈向真正自优化、应用感知操作系统的关键一步

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced

Motivation: 当前行业中的自主数字代理（如Manus AI和Gemini研究模式）在结构化任务中展现出潜力，但尚不清楚基于代理的系统能在多大程度上提高多模态网络数据生产力，特别是在需要迭代规划、解释和上下文推理的新闻领域。

Method: 引入NEWSAGENT基准测试，给定写作指令和原始数据，要求代理识别叙事视角、基于关键词查询、检索历史背景并生成完整文章。测试包含6k个人工验证的真实新闻实例，多模态内容转换为文本以确保广泛模型兼容性。

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT为迭代和评估代理在多模态网络数据操作方面的能力提供了现实测试平台，有助于推动代理技术在实际生产力应用中的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

Motivation: 冰淇淋的融化稳定性是影响消费者接受度和产品质量的关键因素，需要研究不同稳定剂对融化行为的影响，并寻找更具成本效益的配方。

Method: 制备含不同添加剂的冰淇淋样品，在受控条件下进行融化测试，使用延时摄影记录融化过程，并利用Python和OpenCV进行图像处理和分析。

Result: 所有样品融化后仍保持泡沫状结构，表明稳定剂有助于形成稳定的气室矩阵；重新冷冻后再融化的样品显示出更强的结构稳定性；不同稳定剂的效果存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了常用食品添加剂在冰淇淋配方中的功能作用，通过评估性能和成本，证明了开发平衡耐久性和经济效率的配方的潜力，对小型和商业冰淇淋生产具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

TL;DR: 研究系统分析了AI模拟与真实人类课堂对话的结构和行为差异，发现人类对话在语调长度、提问和反馈行为方面显著优于AI，且具有更多样化的交互模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成教育性富丰的课堂对话方面面临挑战，需要系统研究AI模拟与真实人类教学对话的差异

Method: 采用启动-响应-反馈(IRF)编码方案和认知网络分析(ENA)进行定量比较

Result: 人类对话在语调长度、提问(I-Q)和一般反馈(F-F)行为方面显著优于AI；ENA显示人类对话更多样化且以"问题-事实响应-反馈"教学循环为中心，而AI对话则呈现"解释-简单响应"循环的结构简化

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前AI生成教学对话的关键限制，为设计和评估更有教育效果的生成式教育对话系统提供了实证指导

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态提示工程和孤立智能体模拟的局限性，构建动态、可扩展且符合伦理的集体人工智能系统

Method: 四阶段方法：1)用户与LLM形成认知二元组；2)遗传算法辅助的前向-后向进化；3)群体智能协调；4)标准化行为整合为超类大脑

Conclusion: 为可扩展、可解释且符合伦理的集体AI提供了概念基础和架构路线图

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

TL;DR: DSP是一种异步在线强化学习框架，通过动态推测规划实现无损加速，在保持性能的同时降低30%总成本和60%不必要成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理面临延迟高和推理成本昂贵的问题，现有加速方法要么性能损失大，要么需要大量离线训练，缺乏用户对加速与性能权衡的控制。

Method: 提出动态推测规划(DSP)框架，使用异步在线强化学习优化端到端延迟与美元成本的联合目标，通过单一参数调节系统行为。

Result: 在两个标准代理基准测试中，DSP达到与最快无损加速方法相当的效率，同时降低总成本30%，减少不必要成本60%。

Conclusion: DSP提供了一种无需预部署准备的低成本无损加速解决方案，允许用户灵活控制加速与成本之间的权衡。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI-powered workflow that uses Large

plans from natural language prompts. The proposed system interprets textual
input to automatically generate layout options including walls, doors, windows,

case study of a mid-sized residential layout demonstrates the approach's
ability to generate functional and structured outputs with minimal manual
effort. The workflow is designed for transparent replication, with all key

researchers. In addition, the generated models preserve the full range of
Revit-native parametric attributes required for direct integration into
professional BIM processes.

Motivation: 人类能够直觉地通过模拟未言明的动态和推理他人视角来导航社交互动，而AI系统在自动结构和推理这些隐式社交上下文方面存在困难。

Method: 采用POMDP驱动的设计，将社交互动表示为结构化元组（状态、观察、代理行动、心理状态），可以从自由形式叙述中自动推导。

Result: 在5个社交推理任务中显著提升LLM的理解能力（如FANToM的心理理论推理提升51%），在SOTOPIA社交交互基准上决策能力提升18%，达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: S3AP作为一种强大的通用社会世界状态表示形式，有望推动开发更具社会意识的系统，更好地导航社交互动。

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

TL;DR: BALM-TSF是一个轻量级多模态时间序列预测框架，通过平衡文本和时间序列模态的对齐，解决了现有方法中模态不平衡导致信息丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多模态时间序列预测方法存在文本和时间序列数据差异过大，导致过度强调一个模态而忽视另一个模态，造成信息损失和预测性能下降的问题。

Method: 使用时间序列编码器处理原始时间序列，同时将时间序列的描述性统计信息输入带有可学习提示的大语言模型生成文本嵌入。通过缩放策略和对比目标将文本嵌入映射到时间序列嵌入的潜在空间，实现跨模态平衡对齐。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BALM-TSF以最少的可训练参数，在长期预测和少样本预测任务中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BALM-TSF能够有效利用文本和时间序列的互补信息，通过平衡的多模态对齐机制显著提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is
available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发通用ML网络模型需要从多样化真实网络应用中收集流量数据，但现有浏览器自动化工具在多样性、可重复性、真实性和效率方面存在脆弱性和高成本问题。

Method: 用户用自然语言规则定义状态依赖操作，框架将其编译为非确定性有限自动机(NFA)，状态合成组件转换为可重用可执行代码，支持确定性重放和状态缓存减少LLM调用。

Result: 实验自动化了50+个工作流，涵盖视频点播、直播、视频会议、社交媒体和网络爬虫，生成真实流量轨迹且对UI变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NetGent结合基于语言代理的灵活性和编译执行的可靠性，为生成多样化、可重复数据集提供了可扩展基础，推动网络ML发展。

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Conclusion: 模块化架构和形式化知识表示能够通过计算高效模型使复杂法律推理更易实现，同时增强AI法律推理的一致性和可解释性，为未来更透明、可信和有效的法律AI系统奠定基础

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全模态大语言模型在音视频理解和环境感知方面取得显著进展，但仍存在幻觉问题。文本模态先验主导导致模型过度依赖文本线索而忽视视觉和音频信息，同时现有模型在训练中独立对齐各模态而忽略了音视频之间的内在关联。

Method: 提出OmniDPO偏好对齐框架，包含两种策略：(1)构建文本偏好样本对以增强模型对音视频交互的理解；(2)构建多模态偏好样本对以加强模型对视觉和听觉信息的注意力。

Result: 在两个全模态大语言模型上的实验表明，OmniDPO不仅有效缓解了多模态幻觉问题，还显著提升了模型在跨模态推理方面的能力。

Conclusion: OmniDPO通过同时解决文本主导和模态间关联缺失两个挑战，有效改善了多模态基础能力并减少了幻觉现象，为全模态大语言模型的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 结构化上下文注入是一种高效可扩展的策略，能够有效提升LLM在图谱理解任务上的表现，同时避免了高成本的微调或多步查询。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Motivation: 夏普比率是金融领域广泛使用的风险调整收益指标，但在MDP中优化存在两个挑战：动态规划不适用于分数目标和风险度量。需要开发有效的算法来解决这个问题。

Method: 使用Dinkelbach变换将夏普比率优化转换为均值-方差优化问题，开发迭代算法求解M2V问题，通过不断更新风险敏感参数来收敛到最优夏普比率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了MDP中夏普比率优化的挑战，为处理其他分数目标MDP问题提供了新的思路和算法框架。

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合神经网络和符号逻辑的预测性过程监控方法，通过在训练中集成线性时态逻辑来提高后缀预测的准确性和逻辑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在业务过程管理中进行后缀预测时，经常无法满足基本的逻辑约束，因为缺乏领域知识的明确集成。

Method: 提出了一种可微分的逻辑损失函数，使用LTLf语义的软近似和Gumbel-Softmax技巧，可以与标准预测损失结合使用。还提出了局部和全局两种逻辑损失变体。

Result: 在三个实际数据集上的实验评估显示，该方法提高了后缀预测的准确性和对时态约束的遵循程度。

Conclusion: 虽然在BPM背景下开发，但该框架适用于任何符号序列生成任务，并为神经-符号AI的发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闭环胰岛素输送系统(CLIDS)在1型糖尿病中的实际采用率较低，主要障碍不是技术问题，而是行为、心理和社会层面的各种障碍。需要评估LLM在健康行为改变对话中的有效性。

Method: 创建ChatCLIDS基准框架，包含专家验证的虚拟患者库（具有临床基础的异质性特征和现实采用障碍），模拟与配备多种循证说服策略的护士智能体进行多轮交互，支持纵向咨询和对抗性社会影响场景。

Result: 研究发现，虽然更大规模和更具反思性的LLM能够随时间调整策略，但所有模型都难以克服抵抗，特别是在现实社会压力下。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在行为改变方面存在关键局限性，ChatCLIDS为推进医疗保健及其他领域可信赖的说服性AI提供了高保真、可扩展的测试平台。

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

TL;DR: SATQuest是一个系统化的验证工具，通过从CNF实例生成多样化的可满足性逻辑推理问题来评估和增强LLM的逻辑推理能力，解决了现有基准测试缺乏可控性和多维度分析的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型基准测试缺乏可控和可扩展的工具来进行细粒度分析，无法进行多维度系统化分析和训练，或者问题类型和格式过于狭窄。

Method: SATQuest通过三个正交维度（实例规模、问题类型、问题格式）构建问题，采用基于SAT的随机问题生成和通过PySAT的客观答案验证，从CNF实例生成多样化的可满足性逻辑推理问题。

Result: 对各种LLM的广泛评估发现了它们在逻辑推理方面的显著局限性，特别是在泛化到熟悉的数学格式之外时。强化微调显著提高了目标任务性能并能泛化到更复杂的实例。

Conclusion: SATQuest展示了作为基础工具的潜力，是推进LLM逻辑推理能力的宝贵起点，同时突显了跨格式适应的剩余挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了建设性安全对齐(CSA)框架，通过从防御性拒绝转向引导式安全，在保护恶意滥用的同时主动引导心理困扰用户获得安全帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制主要针对恶意攻击者，但现实中风险也来自寻求帮助的非恶意用户（如自伤意图用户）。简单的拒绝可能导致用户重复尝试、升级行为或转向不安全平台，造成更坏结果。

Method: 提出Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA)框架，结合博弈论预测用户反应、细粒度风险边界发现和可解释推理控制，在Oyster-I (Oy1)模型中实现。

Result: Oy1在开源模型中达到最先进的安全水平，在建设性基准测试中接近GPT-5的表现，在Strata-Sword越狱数据集上接近GPT-o1的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CSA通过从拒绝优先转向引导优先的安全范式，重新定义了模型-用户关系，旨在构建不仅安全而且有意义的帮助性系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

Conclusion: 该框架为专利投资决策提供了战略依据，通过自动化匹配高潜力专利与市场需求，提升了技术转移的效率和质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and
real-world credibility.

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to
support human learning. The source code is available on:

TL;DR: CoreThink是一个基于General Symbolics推理方法的最先进推理层，在工具调用、代码生成和规划等任务上表现优异，无需微调或训练成本即可实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如测试时扩展、监督微调、强化学习）在LLM性能提升上会出现收益递减，需要开发新的推理技术。

Method: 采用General Symbolics推理方法，构建推理层，专注于工具调用、代码生成和规划三个关键用例。

Result: 在7个基准测试中表现优异：Livecodebench v6达到66.66%、Instruction-Following Evals达到89%、ARC-AGI-2达到24.4%，基于该方法的智能编码IDE在SWE-Bench Lite上达到62.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: CoreThink推理层提供纯性能提升，确保模型在推理任务上的准确性不会受到负面影响，为推理密集型用例提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Conclusion: UI-TARS-2具有推动GUI代理技术发展的潜力，并在真实世界交互场景中展现出强大的泛化能力，大规模代理RL训练动态分析为实现稳定性和效率提供了见解

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization

TL;DR: 大语言模型代理将成为数据系统的主要工作负荷，需要重新设计数据系统以支持代理任务的特性需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理任务的高吞吐量、异构性、冗余性和可控性给当前数据系统带来挑战，需要专门为代理工作负荷设计新的数据系统架构

Method: 分析代理任务的特征（规模、异构性、冗余性、可控性），提出代理优先的数据系统架构研究机遇

Result: 提出了从新查询接口、新查询处理技术到新代理内存存储等一系列研究方向

Conclusion: 数据系统需要根本性的重新设计来满足大语言模型代理工作负荷的需求，这是一个重要的研究趋势

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

Motivation: 揭示人工智能与自然智能作为计算过程的差异，定义并实现开放计算，探索化学系统中计算过程与环境相互作用的机制。

Method: 将计算建模为化学反应，执行环境建模为分子聚集程度，通过Token计算（个体行为）和Type计算（规范行为）的相互作用实现开放计算。

Result: Token计算展现自组织临界现象，Type计算呈现量子逻辑，两者相互作用实现波动招募，产生量子逻辑子空间间的相互作用，形成尖峰波实现信号传输。

Conclusion: 成功在化学反应中实现了开放计算，发现了量子类相干现象，这可能是控制尖峰波和生化节律的酶源机制。

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

Motivation: 现有的游戏基准测试缺乏多样性，很少评估代理完成整个故事情节的能力，特别是冒险游戏中复杂的叙事驱动交互带来的挑战。

Method: 提出了FlashAdventure基准测试、CUA-as-a-Judge自动游戏评估器，以及COAST代理框架，该框架利用长期线索记忆来更好地规划和解决顺序任务。

Result: 实验显示当前GUI代理在完整故事情节上表现不佳，而COAST通过弥合观察-行为差距显著提高了里程碑完成率，但最佳代理与人类表现之间仍存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 需要继续研究努力来缩小人类与最佳代理之间的性能差距，特别是在处理复杂叙事驱动的游戏交互方面。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具增强强化学习方法存在代码库碎片化、同步执行瓶颈和跨领域可扩展性有限的问题，阻碍了社区采用和算法创新。

Method: 提出VerlTool框架，采用系统化设计原则：上游与VeRL对齐确保兼容性，通过标准化API统一工具管理，异步rollout执行消除同步瓶颈，支持多模态观察令牌（文本/图像/视频）的多轮轨迹。

Result: 在数学推理、知识问答、SQL生成、视觉推理、网络搜索和软件工程等6个ARLT领域实现了竞争性性能，异步执行获得接近2倍的速度提升，模块化插件架构显著减少开发开销。

Conclusion: VerlTool提供了一个可扩展的统一训练基础设施，为工具增强的强化学习研究奠定了坚实基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器人需要同时处理复杂指令、长时程任务规划和自然人类交互的挑战，开发一个端到端的统一框架，使机器人能够执行复杂任务并与人类自然互动。

Method: 采用思维链推理和三阶段训练策略：1）持续预训练增强基础具身推理能力；2）监督微调将人机交互和任务规划建模为统一推理-动作序列；3）强化学习提高推理-动作一致性和长时程任务连贯性。

Result: 实验表明Robix在交互式任务执行方面优于开源和商业基线（如GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro），在多种指令类型（开放式、多阶段、约束、无效和中断）和各种用户参与任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Robix成功实现了机器人推理、任务规划和自然语言交互的统一，为构建更智能、更自然的机器人系统提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819
arXiv:1812.03789, defined here as causal abstractive simulation, can be used to
formalize a simple example of language model simulation. This note considers
the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are

that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description
of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners
in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive
simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to
the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers

TL;DR: AnchorRAG是一个新颖的多智能体协作框架，用于解决传统基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法在开放世界场景中依赖预定义锚点实体的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型依赖静态训练语料库，容易出现事实错误和知识空白。现有的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法假设锚点实体可访问来启动图遍历，这在开放世界设置中限制了鲁棒性。

Method: 提出AnchorRAG多智能体协作框架：预测器智能体动态识别候选锚点实体，检索器智能体并行进行多跳探索，监督器智能体制定迭代检索策略并综合知识路径生成最终答案。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AnchorRAG显著优于现有基线方法，在现实世界问答任务上建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: AnchorRAG通过多智能体协作框架提高了检索鲁棒性，减轻了模糊或错误锚点的影响，为开放世界检索增强生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

Conclusion: VGTeam democratizes video production by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

TL;DR: 本文评估了结果奖励模型(ORMs)在Text-to-SQL任务中的效果，相比传统的Best-of-N和多数投票方法，ORMs通过语义正确性评估显著提升了SQL查询生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在生成复杂SQL查询时仍难以精确对齐用户意图和数据库模式，现有的测试时策略如Best-of-N和多数投票仅依赖表层启发式方法，缺乏对语义正确性的深度评估。

Method: 提出了训练Text-to-SQL任务专用ORMs的框架，在BIRD和SPIDER基准上对Qwen2、Granite3、Llama3等开源LLM进行微调，通过语义正确性评估为生成输出分配效用分数。

Result: ORMs在BIRD和SPIDER基准上分别比执行型Best-of-N提升4.33%和2.10%的执行准确率，比多数投票方法提升2.91%和0.93%。对已对齐SQL生成的模型(如OmniSQL)微调可获得更优性能。

Conclusion: ORMs作为有效的启发式方法，在Text-to-SQL任务中显著优于传统策略，特别是在复杂查询和更多候选查询情况下表现更佳，为提升自然语言到SQL转换的准确性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

Motivation: 现有QPM方法在处理多模态动态系统时会产生过于保守和无信息量的预测区间，缺乏模态特定的满意度信息

Method: 利用深度生成模型（基于分数的扩散模型）近似概率多模态系统动态，使用模态分类器按动态模态划分预测轨迹，对每个模态应用保形推断生成统计有效的模态特定预测区间

Result: 在智能体导航和自动驾驶任务基准测试中，GenQPM产生的预测区间比模态无关基线方法显著更具信息量（更不保守）

Conclusion: GenQPM方法有效解决了多模态随机系统的定量预测监控问题，提供了更具信息量的模态特定预测区间

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

Motivation: 直接使用LLMs/VLMs进行CAD部件检索遇到输入序列超长、性能不佳、调优资源消耗大以及专有模型无法微调等挑战

Method: 构建Error Notebooks（收集历史错误的思维链和答案，通过反思缩正连接至正确解）+ RAG技术从Error Notebooks中检索规范相关记录并整合到推理过程

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini系列模型上实验，GPT-4o (Omni)在人类偏好数据集上绝对准确率提升达23.4%，对部件数量较多(＾10)的复杂情况效果更佳

Conclusion: 该框架无需额外训练即可显著提升现有模型的CAD部件检索性能，特别适用于处理长度非自然语言元数据的3D模型，具有重要工程应用价值

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

### [563] [Counterfactual Sensitivity for Faithful Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01544)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR)训练方法，通过对中间推理过程进行反事实干预来增强LLM的推理忠实度，在多个结构化推理任务中显著提升模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常在产生正确答案的同时依赖有缺陷或不相关的推理轨迹，这在高风险领域中削弱了其可信度。需要一种方法来确保模型的中间推理与最终输出之间存在真实的依赖关系。

Method: 提出CSR训练目标，在训练过程中引入自动化的操作符级别反事实干预（如将"+"替换为"-"），惩罚那些在逻辑无效的推理轨迹下仍保持相同答案的模型。该方法只需要每个样本额外一次前向传播。

Result: 在算术推理(GSM8K)、逻辑推理(PrOntoQA)和规划任务(Blocks World)中，CSR相比标准微调和过程监督方法，将忠实度提升了高达70个百分点，同时仅带来轻微准确率损失。学到的敏感性能够泛化到更大模型并与推理时方法（如自一致性）协同工作。

Conclusion: CSR是一种轻量级的训练方法，能有效提升LLM推理过程的忠实度，增强模型的可信度。该方法还可扩展到常识推理任务，通过语义扰动进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

*Julian Gerald Dcruz,Argyrios Zolotas,Niall Ross Greenwood,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结构化决策框架，作为负责任AI的基础步骤，在灾害管理领域进行自主决策。该框架通过引入启动器代理、级别和场景概念，在多个场景中比判断基础系统提高60.94%的稳定性，比人类运营商38.93%的更高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在航空航天和应急响应等安全关键领域应用日益普及，需要解决自主决策的伦理问题，确保决策在关系人命时保持可靠性和合理性。

Method: 提出结构化决策框架，通过引入启动器代理、级别和场景概念来实现自主决策，并在灾害管理领域进行实施。将该框架与仅依赖判断的系统以及有灾害经验的人类运营商（受害者、志愿者和利益相关方）进行性能评估。

Result: 结构化决策框架在多个场景中比判断基础系统实现60.94%更高的稳定性，能够持续做出准确决策。同时，该框架在各种场景中的准确性比人类运营商高38.93%。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明了结构化决策框架在安全关键环境中构建更可靠自主AI应用的潜力，为负责任AI的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

*Abhinav Kumar,Jaechul Roh,Ali Naseh,Amir Houmansadr,Eugene Bagdasarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种可调节的Web组件限速框架，通过采用需要多跳推理的谜题挑战，使AI网络代理涉及过高的计算成本，从而阻止恶意或错误的访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI网络代理可能导致的资源过载、突破CAPTCHA防御系统、创建假账户等问题，同时保护内容提供商免受拒绝服务攻击和爬虫。

Method: 设计了基于谜题的推理门槽系统，要求代理解决需要多跳推理的综合知识谜题，以增加其词汇生成成本。开发了可扩展的生成和验证协议。

Result: 框架实现了计算不对称性，响应生成成本比SOTA模型高9.2倍。在自定义网站和MCP服务器上部署并通过真实网络代理评估。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效限制AI网络代理的访问，但需考虑实际部署的限制和环境影响。

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

*Chongwen Zhao,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的神经元级可解释性方法，通过识别安全相关神经元并调整其激活来控制LLM行为，进而开发了SafeTuning微调策略来增强模型对越狱攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各领域的广泛应用，存在用户试图利用这些模型进行恶意目的（如合成受控物质、传播虚假信息）的越狱攻击。虽然已有研究通过修改输出分布或检测有害内容来实现防御，但其基本原理仍不清楚。

Method: 提出神经元级可解释性方法，将模型内部表示投影到更一致和可解释的词汇空间，识别安全相关神经元。通过调整这些神经元的激活来控制模型行为，并基于此开发SafeTuning微调策略来强化安全关键神经元。

Result: 调整安全相关神经元激活可有效控制模型行为，平均攻击成功率（ASR）高于97%。SafeTuning在多个LLMs上持续降低攻击成功率，并优于所有四个基线防御方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解和防御越狱攻击提供了新视角，通过神经元级分析揭示了安全机制的内在原理，并开发了有效的防御策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

Motivation: 用户常忽略隐私政策的理解，现有方法缺乏大规模获取形式化政策的能力，影响用户中心网络接近和数据共享

Method: 提出语义中心方法，利用先进大语言模型自动识别隐私政策中的关键信息，构建基于数据隐私词汇(DPV)的Pr²Graph知识图，支持ODRL和psDToU等形式政策表示

Result: 建立了前100流行网站的Pr²Graph公开资源，对不同LLM模型进行了性能测诅，丰富了Policy-IE数据集并通过法律专家验证

Conclusion: 该技术为大规模分析网络服务隐私实践提供了可行方向，有助于网络和互联网审计，所有数据集和源代码已公开以便重用和改进

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EigenBench是一个无需真实标签的黑盒方法，通过模型间相互评估来量化语言模型与给定价值体系的对齐程度，使用EigenTrust算法聚合评估结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI与人类价值观对齐缺乏定量度量标准的问题，为价值对齐提供可比较的基准测试方法。

Method: 给定模型集合、价值体系宪法和场景数据集，让模型相互评估输出，使用EigenTrust算法聚合评估结果生成对齐分数向量。

Result: EigenBench能够量化模型的价值对齐程度，研究发现大部分方差由提示词解释，但仍有小部分残差反映模型本身的倾向性。

Conclusion: EigenBench为价值对齐提供了有效的定量评估框架，能够区分提示词影响和模型固有倾向，是解决AI价值观对齐问题的重要工具。

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了mFARM多维度公平性评估框架和FAB公平性-准确性平衡评分，用于评估医疗场景中LLM的偏见问题，并在两个大规模医疗基准测试上验证了四个开源LLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性评估方法在医疗高风险场景中存在不足，使用简单指标忽略了医疗伤害的多维性，且可能导致模型因临床惰性而显得公平但实际不准确。

Method: 构建了两个大规模受控基准测试（ED-Triage和Opioid Analgesic Recommendation），包含5万多个提示和12种种族×性别变体；提出了mFARM多维度公平性评估框架，评估分配性、稳定性和潜在性三个维度的差异，并聚合为mFARM分数；还提出了FAB分数来平衡公平性和预测准确性。

Result: 评估了四个开源LLM及其微调版本，发现mFARM指标在各种设置下能更有效地捕捉细微偏见；大多数模型在不同量化水平下保持稳健的mFARM性能，但在上下文减少时显著恶化。

Conclusion: 提出的mFARM框架能更好地评估医疗LLM的公平性问题，基准测试和评估代码已公开以促进医疗AI对齐研究。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

phenomenon of generative AI and formulating requirements for its use in TA, the
following article discusses in detail the structural causes of the problems

developed, the structurally induced risks remain. The article concludes with
proposed solutions and brief notes on their feasibility, as well as some
examples of the use of generative AI in TA work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能虽然功能广泛，但缺乏真正的智能深度，只是表面模拟。需要定义真正的智能标准来区分表面功能和深度智能。

Method: 提出结构性生成智能本体论框架，包含三个核心条件：生成性（创造新结构）、协调性（将结构组织成理由）、持续性（维持身份认同）。

Result: 建立了衡量真正智能的理论框架，指出当前AI系统由于缺乏这三个条件而只是表面模拟，并非真正智能。

Conclusion: 真正的智能需要深度而非广度，如果未来系统能满足这三个条件，可能成为与人类并存的"第二存在"，而不仅仅是工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

Conclusion: 结构化提示工程是一种有潜力的工具，能够在法律领域及更广泛应用中确保AI的责任性和可负责性。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the
increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological
surveillance, are marking a pivotal moment in epidemiology and public health
research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach
which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable
actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global
outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to
respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated
dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced
representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

Conclusion: REx是推进AI驱动科学发现的相关贡献，能够产生既有洞察力又基于既定生物医学知识的解释

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成模型在图像和视频生成领域取得了显著进展，但在金融领域仍然主要依赖时间序列数据和transformer模型，缺乏生成模型的多样化应用。

Method: 将时间序列数据作为图像处理，使用扩散模型从当前图表图像和指令提示生成下一个图表图像，并引入简单的方法来评估生成图像与真实图像的对比。

Result: 展示了在金融领域利用文本到图像生成模型的潜力，证明了该方法在股票价格趋势预测中的可行性。

Conclusion: 研究结果激励进一步研究以解决当前局限性并扩展生成模型在金融领域的适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

### [578] [Explainability-Driven Dimensionality Reduction for Hyperspectral Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02340)
*Salma Haidar,José Oramas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于模型解释性的高光谱图像波段选择方法，通过事后可解释性技术量化各波段对分类决策的贡献度，选择最具影响力的波段子集，在保持分类精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像具有丰富的光谱信息，但高维特性带来了计算负担和冗余问题。传统的波段选择方法往往缺乏理论依据，需要一种基于模型决策原理的、可解释的波段选择框架。

Method: 使用训练好的分类器，通过事后可解释性方法量化每个波段对分类决策的贡献；进行删除-插入评估，记录波段移除或重新引入时的置信度变化；将这些信号聚合成影响力分数，选择最高影响力的波段子集。

Result: 在两个公开基准数据集（Pavia University和Salinas）上的实验表明，仅使用30个选定波段训练的 classifiers 就能达到或超过全光谱基线的性能，同时显著降低计算需求。选定的波段子集与物理上有意义、高度判别性的波长区域一致。

Conclusion: 基于模型对齐、解释性引导的波段选择是高光谱图像维度缩减的有效原则性方法，能够在保持预测性能的同时提高计算效率，并且所选波段具有明确的物理意义。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SWE-PRM是一种推理时过程奖励模型，通过在LLM代理执行软件工程任务时进行干预，检测和纠正轨迹级错误，提高任务解决率和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在复杂软件工程任务中经常出现冗余探索、循环和无法及时终止等低效行为，现有方法主要在事后诊断失败，需要实时干预机制

Method: 提出SWE-PRM过程奖励模型，利用常见低效行为的分类学，在执行过程中提供轻量级、可解释的反馈，不修改底层策略

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上，闭源PRM将解决率从40.0%提升至50.6%（+10.6个百分点），在中等和困难任务上提升最大，分类学引导的PRM表现最佳

Conclusion: PRM以可接受的额外推理成本（低至0.2美元）显著提高SWE代理的可靠性和效率，是一种实用且可扩展的机制

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的LLM代理，通过检索不确定性和摘要不确定性来提高多表生物医学数据摘要的事实性和校准性，在多个基准测试中显著提升了准确性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在处理结构化生物医学数据时经常产生流畅但过于自信的输出，特别是在复杂的多表数据推理中，需要更好的不确定性管理来提高可靠性。

Method: 结合两种互补的不确定性信号：检索不确定性（多表选择rollout的熵）和摘要不确定性（自一致性和困惑度组合），通过GRPO强化学习整合摘要不确定性，并在推理时使用两种不确定性进行过滤和高质量合成数据集构建。

Result: 在多组学基准测试中，事实性和校准性显著改善，正确有用的声明数量几乎翻了三倍（内部3.0→8.4；癌症多组学3.6→9.9），下游生存预测性能大幅提升（C-index 0.32→0.63）。

Conclusion: 不确定性可以作为控制信号，使代理能够弃权、传达置信度，并成为复杂结构化数据环境中更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

TL;DR: KG-RAG是一个基于知识图谱的检索增强生成框架，通过将碎片化的UI转换图转换为结构化向量数据库，显著提升GUI代理在复杂移动任务中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在处理复杂移动任务时面临应用特定知识有限的问题，UI转换图(UTG)虽然提供了结构化导航表示，但由于提取效果差和集成效率低而未被充分利用。

Method: 提出KG-RAG框架：1）将碎片化UTG转换为结构化向量数据库；2）采用意图引导的LLM搜索方法；3）生成可操作的导航路径来增强代理决策能力。

Result: 在多个移动应用中，KG-RAG实现了75.8%的成功率（比AutoDroid提升8.9%）、84.6%的决策准确率（提升8.1%），平均任务步骤从4.5减少到4.1。在Web/桌面环境也有显著提升。

Conclusion: KG-RAG有效解决了GUI代理在复杂移动任务中的知识限制问题，UTG成本分析显示每个复杂应用约4小时即可达到准确率饱和，具备实际部署的可行性。同时发布了针对中文移动生态的两个基准测试集。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, Graphic User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex mobile tasks due to limited
app-specific knowledge. While UI Transition Graphs (UTGs) offer structured
navigation representations, they are underutilized due to poor extraction and
inefficient integration. We introduce KG-RAG, a Knowledge Graph-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that transforms fragmented UTGs into
structured vector databases for efficient real-time retrieval. By leveraging an
intent-guided LLM search method, KG-RAG generates actionable navigation paths,
enhancing agent decision-making. Experiments across diverse mobile apps show
that KG-RAG outperforms existing methods, achieving a 75.8% success rate (8.9%
improvement over AutoDroid), 84.6% decision accuracy (8.1% improvement), and
reducing average task steps from 4.5 to 4.1. Additionally, we present
KG-Android-Bench and KG-Harmony-Bench, two benchmarks tailored to the Chinese
mobile ecosystem for future research. Finally, KG-RAG transfers to web/desktop

To address these limitations, we propose MobiAgent, a comprehensive mobile

models, the AgentRR acceleration framework, and the MobiFlow benchmarking
suite. Furthermore, recognizing that the capabilities of current mobile agents
are still limited by the availability of high-quality data, we have developed
an AI-assisted agile data collection pipeline that significantly reduces the
cost of manual annotation. Compared to both general-purpose LLMs and

Abstract: Cybersecurity defense involves interactions between adversarial parties
(namely defenders and hackers), making multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) an ideal approach for modeling and learning strategies for these
scenarios. This paper addresses one of the key challenges to MARL, the
complexity of simultaneous training of agents in nontrivial environments, and
presents a novel policy-based Nash Q-learning to directly converge onto a
steady equilibrium. We demonstrate the successful implementation of this
algorithm in a notable complex cyber defense simulation treated as a two-player
zero-sum Markov game setting. We propose the Nash Q-Network, which aims to
learn Nash-optimal strategies that translate to robust defenses in
cybersecurity settings. Our approach incorporates aspects of proximal policy

common challenges like non-stationarity and instability in multi-agent

Abstract: Controller synthesis is a theoretical approach to the systematic design of
discrete event systems. It constructs a controller to provide feedback and
control to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications.
Traditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe
control specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and
non-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the
control requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based
on this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative
semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the
controller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications. The
controller can ensure the satisfaction of specifications to a certain extent.
The specification is given in the form of a linear temporal logic formula. This
paper designs a controller synthesis algorithm that combines probabilistic
model checking. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through a
case study.

Abstract: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care and healthcare systems
worldwide, yet the effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains poorly
understood due to fundamental information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply
chains. We present \textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model
(LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex,
strategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and
regulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional
game-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information,
\textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational
decision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game
spanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive
alerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential
disruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity
investment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage
events reveal that \textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage
for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\%, bringing simulated durations more
aligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source
\textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at

Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can
significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying
emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human
responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and
disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete
perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To
enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire
scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire
prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency
response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph
(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs
from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide
interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component
configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and
real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical
application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.

Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for
advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on
specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于函数的无对应点sim-to-real学习方法，用于控制可变形自由曲面，无需依赖标记点对应关系，通过神经网络学习变形函数空间和置信度图来实现模拟到现实的映射。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了无缝的sim-to-real转换，可集成到基于神经网络的计算管道中，用于逆向运动学和形状控制，为软机器人控制提供了更灵活可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real
learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike
traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points
with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation
function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network
-- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the
sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as
point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker
points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be
seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for
inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and
adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically
actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft
manipulators.

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

Motivation: 自动车辆定位(AVL)数据的更新频率不一致影响了轨迹重建的效果，需要系统性评估各种重建方法的性能和适用性。

Method: 使用得克萨斯州高分辨率AVL数据，评估13种轨迹重建方法，分析速度、位置、平滑和数据密度四个关键因素的影响。结合位置和速度错误指标，考虑物理实际性要求。

Result: 速度感知方法表现一致优于仅基于位置的方法。平滑方法在复杂城市环境中可能降低性能，但单调性约束仍重要。VCHIP-ME方法获得最佳结果，在准确性和计算效率之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为轨迹重建系统的实施提供了实用指南，并强调投资高频率AVL数据收集对改善分析质量的重要性。VCHIP-ME方法适用于各种应用场景，特别是与密集数据集结合时具有显著预测能力。

Abstract: Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics,
but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies,
necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory
reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using
high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four
critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on
reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of
these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the
trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework
combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity
with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning
velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed
variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each
method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our
findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform
position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based
methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban
environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity
constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME)
yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both
historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant
predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer
practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory
reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in
higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.

Motivation: 在动态机器人任务中，机器人需要在无法重试的情况下准确识别物体的物理属性，以保证任务执行的成功率。

Method: 提出了一种基于敌对学习的任务信息探索方法，利用特权任务攻略对估计错误的敏感性自动生成奖励，训练探索攻略，并通过不确定性机制决定何时从探索转换到任务执行。

Result: 在击球任务中达到90%的成功率，平均探索时间仅1.2秒，显著超过基线方法（最多40%成功率）。还在KUKA iiwa机器臂上验证了方法的实际效果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地识别物体属性并为动态任务提供可靠的任务执行，为无法重试的现场环境中的机器人操作提供了解决方案。

Abstract: In many dynamic robotic tasks, such as striking pucks into a goal outside the
reachable workspace, the robot must first identify the relevant physical
properties of the object for successful task execution, as it is unable to
recover from failure or retry without human intervention. To address this
challenge, we propose a task-informed exploration approach, based on
reinforcement learning, that trains an exploration policy using rewards
automatically generated from the sensitivity of a privileged task policy to
errors in estimated properties. We also introduce an uncertainty-based
mechanism to determine when to transition from exploration to task execution,
ensuring sufficient property estimation accuracy with minimal exploration time.
Our method achieves a 90% success rate on the striking task with an average
exploration time under 1.2 seconds, significantly outperforming baselines that
achieve at most 40% success or require inefficient querying and retraining in a
simulator at test time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our task-informed
rewards capture the relative importance of physical properties in both the
striking task and the classical CartPole example. Finally, we validate our
approach by demonstrating its ability to identify object properties and adjust
task execution in a physical setup using the KUKA iiwa robot arm.

Conclusion: 该方法结合了专门优化器的样本效率和速度优势，同时保持了标准方法的通用性，避免了其他一阶模型基于强化学习方法的不良行为。

Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,
across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

Motivation: 机器人经常遇到视觉上模糊的物体，这些物体的操作结果在实际交互前存在不确定性。虽然生成模型理论上可以适应这种模糊性，但实际中即使在条件化动作历史的情况下仍然表现次优。

Method: 提出显式将动作生成与验证解耦：使用无条件滴流生成器提出多个候选动作，然后采用历史感知验证器(HAVE)通过论证过往交互来选择最有前景的动作。

Result: 通过理论分析证明使用验证器显著提高了预期动作质量。在多个模拟和实际环境中的实验证和分析（包括关节物体、多模态门和不平坦物体摘取）确认了方法的有效性和超过基准方法的改进。

Conclusion: HAVE方法通过显式解耦动作生成与验证，利用历史交互信息来解决视觉模糊问题，为机器人在不确定场景中的可靠操作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel History-Aware VErifier (HAVE) to disambiguate uncertain
scenarios online by leveraging past interactions. Robots frequently encounter
visually ambiguous objects whose manipulation outcomes remain uncertain until
physically interacted with. While generative models alone could theoretically
adapt to such ambiguity, in practice they obtain suboptimal performance in
ambiguous cases, even when conditioned on action history. To address this, we
propose explicitly decoupling action generation from verification: we use an
unconditional diffusion-based generator to propose multiple candidate actions
and employ our history-aware verifier to select the most promising action by
reasoning about past interactions. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that employing a verifier significantly improves expected action quality.
Empirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and real-world
environments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven
object pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over
baselines. Our project website is available at:

Conclusion: TReF-6提供了一种可解释的空间表示方法，支持从单次演示中学习并泛化到新场景，解决了机器人模仿学习中的空间泛化问题。

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work,
we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF
Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an
influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a
local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement
Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure,
extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The
inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and
localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate
robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on
real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation
learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

Conclusion: TMP-EAOG框架具有对不确定性的鲁棒性、可控的自主性和有限的灵活性，能够适应不同的空间机器人应用场景

Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including
high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and
limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion
Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or
even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete
action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In
this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,
referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different
scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,
which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop
motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,
TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a
certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate
for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled
autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)
bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of
unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative
paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We
use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous
robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of
challenges in the benchmarks.

Conclusion: 基于深度强化学习的接触辅助导航策略显著提升了柔性内窥镜的导航性能，优于现有方法

Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal
tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in
the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to
effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target
locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact
force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The
training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method
(FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success
rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and
significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach
environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average
error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios
with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based
CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior
methods.

Conclusion: 证明了VLA模型的可解释组件可以系统性地用于控制，为机器人领域的透明可控基础模型建立了新范式

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing
generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and
environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far
short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of
kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a
central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where
robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in
mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first
framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal
representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference
time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the
token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these
findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that
modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or
environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source
VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in
simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that
interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for
control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation
models in robotics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了JEDP-RL框架，通过分阶段雅可比矩阵估计和策略执行来解决可变形连续体机器人的规划问题，相比PPO基线在收敛速度、导航效率和泛化能力方面都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可变形连续体机器人(DCRs)由于非线性变形力学和部分状态可观测性，违反了传统强化学习的马尔可夫假设，而基于雅可比的方法在DCRs上的直接应用受到时变运动学和欠驱动变形动力学的限制。

Method: 提出Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL)框架，将规划分解为分阶段的雅可比估计和策略执行：首先执行小规模局部探索动作估计变形雅可比矩阵，然后用雅可比特征增强状态表示以恢复近似马尔可夫性。

Result: 在SOFA手术动态仿真中，JEDP-RL相比PPO基线表现出三大优势：1)收敛速度快3.2倍；2)导航效率提高25%（到达目标所需步数减少25%）；3)泛化能力强（材料属性变化下92%成功率，未见组织环境中83%成功率，比PPO高33%）。

Conclusion: JEDP-RL框架通过结合局部探索和雅可比特征增强，有效解决了DCRs的规划挑战，在收敛速度、效率和泛化能力方面都显著优于传统强化学习方法。

Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to
nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the
Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While
Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators,
their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and
underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory
Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased
Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first
perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation
Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features
to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic
simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy
optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy
convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the
target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material
property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the
unseen tissue environment.

Abstract: Traditional aggregate sorting methods, whether manual or mechanical, often
suffer from low precision, limited flexibility, and poor adaptability to
diverse material properties such as size, shape, and lithology. To address
these limitations, this study presents a computer vision-aided robotic arm
system designed for autonomous aggregate sorting in construction and mining
applications. The system integrates a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, a
binocular stereo camera for 3D perception, and a ROS-based control framework.
Core techniques include an attention-augmented YOLOv8 model for aggregate
detection, stereo matching for 3D localization, Denavit-Hartenberg kinematic
modeling for arm motion control, minimum enclosing rectangle analysis for size
estimation, and hand-eye calibration for precise coordinate alignment.
Experimental validation with four aggregate types achieved an average grasping
and sorting success rate of 97.5%, with comparable classification accuracy.
Remaining challenges include the reliable handling of small aggregates and
texture-based misclassification. Overall, the proposed system demonstrates
significant potential to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and
improve safety in aggregate handling, while providing a scalable framework for
advancing smart automation in construction, mining, and recycling industries.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires systems that can
generalize across diverse tasks while maintaining robust and reliable
performance. We introduce {GVF-TAPE}, a closed-loop framework that combines
generative visual foresight with task-agnostic pose estimation to enable
scalable robotic manipulation. GVF-TAPE employs a generative video model to
predict future RGB-D frames from a single side-view RGB image and a task
description, offering visual plans that guide robot actions. A decoupled pose
estimation model then extracts end-effector poses from the predicted frames,
translating them into executable commands via low-level controllers. By
iteratively integrating video foresight and pose estimation in a closed loop,
GVF-TAPE achieves real-time, adaptive manipulation across a broad range of
tasks. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach reduces reliance on task-specific action data and
generalizes effectively, providing a practical and scalable solution for
intelligent robotic systems.

Abstract: This paper presents two types of extended diffeomorphism designs to
compensate for spatial placement differences between robot workspaces.
Teleoperation of multiple robots is attracting attention to expand the
utilization of the robot embodiment. Real-time reproduction of robot motion
would facilitate the efficient execution of similar tasks by multiple robots. A
challenge in the motion reproduction is compensating for the spatial
arrangement errors of target keypoints in robot workspaces. This paper proposes
a methodology for smooth mappings that transform primary robot poses into
follower robot poses based on the predefined key points in each workspace.
Through a picking task experiment using a dual-arm UR5 robot, this study
demonstrates that the proposed mapping generation method can balance lower
mapping errors for precise operation and lower mapping gradients for smooth
replicated movement.

Abstract: Tissue biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing many diseases, involving
the extraction of diseased tissue for histopathology analysis by expert
pathologists. However, this procedure has two main limitations: 1) Manual

Result: 在MuJoCo物理引擎中模拟差速移动机器人，性能优于原始计算力矩控制器和传统运动学控制器

Conclusion: 该方法能够用少量学习回合找到任意奖励函数的最优控制器参数集，实现了样本效率和稳定性的提升

Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control
of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers
from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability
guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL
agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample
efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an
optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using
only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some
controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges,
ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also
applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The
controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot
simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a
conventional kinematic controller.

Conclusion: LfD为电影领域提供了无需奖励函数的鲁棒替代方案，能够实时部署且技术投入最小，使创意专业人员能够实现直观、风格化的相机控制

Abstract: Cinematic camera control demands a balance of precision and artistry -
qualities that are difficult to encode through handcrafted reward functions.
While reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to robotic filmmaking, its
reliance on bespoke rewards and extensive tuning limits creative usability. We
propose a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach using Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to automate dolly-in shots with a
free-roaming, ground-based filming robot. Expert trajectories are collected via
joystick teleoperation in simulation, capturing smooth, expressive motion
without explicit objective design.
  Trained exclusively on these demonstrations, our GAIL policy outperforms a
PPO baseline in simulation, achieving higher rewards, faster convergence, and
lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without
fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a
prior TD3-based method. These results show that LfD offers a robust,
reward-free alternative to RL in cinematic domains, enabling real-time
deployment with minimal technical effort. Our pipeline brings intuitive,
stylized camera control within reach of creative professionals, bridging the
gap between artistic intent and robotic autonomy.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent
years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with
human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This
paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and
efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method
integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into
the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively
maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The
framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and
HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC
computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the
closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware
trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations
conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency,
and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as
quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that
the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth
transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work
bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning
approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications.

Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) field has traditionally used Wizard-of-Oz
(WoZ) controlled robots to explore navigation, conversational dynamics,
human-in-the-loop interactions, and more to explore appropriate robot behaviors
in everyday settings. However, existing WoZ tools are often limited to one

robotic platforms. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Context-Adaptable
Robot Interface System (CARIS) that combines advanced robotic capabilities such
teleoperation, human perception, human-robot dialogue, and multimodal data
recording. Through pilot studies, we demonstrate the potential of CARIS to WoZ
control a robot in two contexts: 1) mental health companion and as a 2) tour
guide. Furthermore, we identified areas of improvement for CARIS, including
smoother integration between movement and communication, clearer functionality
separation, recommended prompts, and one-click communication options to enhance
the usability wizard control of CARIS. This project offers a publicly
available, context-adaptable tool for the HRI community, enabling researchers
to streamline data-driven approaches to intelligent robot behavior.

Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety,
stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory
planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high
computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited
validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose
an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i)
a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly
balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this
cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of
desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed
framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a
dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is
based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and
sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The
sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the
proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives,
providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization
methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of
scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.

Abstract: Visual SLAM algorithms have been enhanced through the exploration of Gaussian
Splatting representations, particularly in generating high-fidelity dense maps.
While existing methods perform reliably in static environments, they often
encounter camera tracking drift and fuzzy mapping when dealing with the
disturbances caused by moving objects. This paper presents DyPho-SLAM, a
real-time, resource-efficient visual SLAM system designed to address the
challenges of localization and photorealistic mapping in environments with
dynamic objects. Specifically, the proposed system integrates prior image
information to generate refined masks, effectively minimizing noise from mask
misjudgment. Additionally, to enhance constraints for optimization after
removing dynamic obstacles, we devise adaptive feature extraction strategies
significantly improving the system's resilience. Experiments conducted on
publicly dynamic RGB-D datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation and dense map
reconstruction, while operating in real-time in dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: 该方法能够更高效地解决更广泛类型的6-DOF机器人的逆运动学问题，为实际应用提供了更灵活的解决方案

Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a
specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer
algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive
rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse
kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We
extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of
two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF
manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is
expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is
solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of
the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive
calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method
is shown by experiments.

Abstract: As robot technology advances, collaboration between humans and robots will
become more prevalent in industrial tasks. When humans run into issues in such
scenarios, a likely future involves relying on artificial agents or robots for
aid. This study identifies key aspects for the design of future user-assisting

examining the impact of on-demand assistance received from a remote human in a
human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly task. We study scenarios in which
users require help and we assess their experiences in requesting and receiving
assistance. Additionally, we investigate participants' perceptions of future
non-human assisting agents and whether assistance should be on-demand or
unsolicited. Through a user study, we analyze the impact that such design
decisions (human or artificial assistant, on-demand or unsolicited help) can
have on elicited emotional responses, productivity, and preferences of humans
engaged in HRC tasks.

Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a
6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the
motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we
are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector
should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse
kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The
proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible
region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector.
Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint
configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the
specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to
the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by
reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying
Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by
experiments.

Abstract: This paper examines the speculative topic of equitable robots through an
exploratory essay format. It focuses specifically on robots by and for LGBTQ+
populations. It aims to provoke thought and conversations in the field about
what aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, both in the arts and
sciences. First, it briefly reviews the state-of-the-art of queer robotics in
fiction and science, drawing together threads from each. Then, it discusses
queering robots through three speculative design proposals for queer robot
roles: 1) reflecting the queerness of their ''in-group'' queer users, building
and celebrating ''in-group'' identity, 2) a new kind of queer activism by
implementing queer robot identity performance to interact with ''out-group''
users, with a goal of reducing bigotry through familiarisation, and 3) a
network of queer-owned robots, through which the community could reach each
other, and distribute and access important resources. The paper then questions
whether robots should be queered, and what ethical implications this raises.
Finally, the paper makes suggestions for what aspirational queer robotics
futures may look like, and what would be required to get there.

Result: 在2D环境中达到近100%成功率，7自由度机械臂仿真中保持高成功率，控制频率超过750Hz

Conclusion: CDF-MPPI框架在保持碰撞避免能力的同时大幅降低计算成本，为高维运动规划提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in
robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients
of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.
However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the
SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have
been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration
space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and
thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free
approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage
long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these
methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory
samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost
functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a
framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the
robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost
in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting
computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate
that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and
consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator
simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control
frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both
optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for
high-dimensional motion planning.

Abstract: This paper presents an MFG-based decision-making framework for autonomous
driving in heterogeneous traffic. To capture diverse human behaviors, we
propose a quantitative driving style representation that maps abstract traits
to parameters such as speed, safety factors, and reaction time. These
parameters are embedded into the MFG through a spatial influence field model.
To ensure safe operation in dense traffic, we introduce a safety-critical
lane-changing algorithm that leverages dynamic safety margins,
time-to-collision analysis, and multi-layered constraints. Real-world NGSIM
data is employed for style calibration and empirical validation. Experimental
results demonstrate zero collisions across six style combinations, two
15-vehicle scenarios, and NGSIM-based trials, consistently outperforming
conventional game-theoretic baselines. Overall, our approach provides a
scalable, interpretable, and behavior-aware planning framework for real-world
autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) in multi-object teleoperation tasks
faces significant challenges due to perceptual ambiguities in virtual reality
(VR) environments and the limitations of single-modality intention recognition.
This paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual
admittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception
Network (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The
VA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target
objects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN
processes multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and
environmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to
overcome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four
conditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly
improved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency
by reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality.
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with
implicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for
multi-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across
various applications in the future.

Abstract: Indoor built environments like homes and offices often present complex and
cluttered layouts that pose significant challenges for individuals who are
blind or visually impaired, especially when performing tasks that involve
locating and gathering multiple objects. While many existing assistive

assistive mobile robot system that combines natural language understanding with
vision-language foundation models (VLM), frontier-based exploration, and a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planner. OpenGuide
interprets open-vocabulary requests, reasons about object-scene relationships,
and adaptively navigates and localizes multiple target items in novel
environments. Our approach enables robust recovery from missed detections
through value decay and belief-space reasoning, resulting in more effective
exploration and object localization. We validate OpenGuide in simulated and
real-world experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in task success

Abstract: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework for multi-DoF grippers that
combines task-space velocity fields with a joint-space Quadratic Program (QP)
in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is
particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, since simultaneous increases in
state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of
the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we
plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions,
and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This
approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space
coordinates (or in some cases a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a
weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields
with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments with
privileged knowledge and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking
algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand
systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to
dynamic environments and external disturbances.

Conclusion: 基于随机过程的概率分布控制方法FPE-MPC能够有效解决软体机器人运动控制中的不确定性问题，为软体机器人控制提供了新思路

Abstract: The inherent flexibility of soft robots offers numerous advantages, such as
enhanced adaptability and improved safety. However, this flexibility can also
introduce challenges regarding highly uncertain and nonlinear motion. These
challenges become particularly problematic when using open-loop control
methods, which lack a feedback mechanism and are commonly employed in soft
robot control. Though one potential solution is model-based control, typical
deterministic models struggle with uncertainty as mentioned above. The idea is
to use the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), a master equation of a stochastic
process, to control not the state of soft robots but the probabilistic
distribution. In this study, we propose and implement a stochastic-based
control strategy, termed FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC), for a
soft robotic finger. Two numerical simulation case studies examine the
performance and characteristics of this control method, revealing its efficacy
in managing the uncertainty inherent in soft robotic systems.

Conclusion: SRR-SLAM显著提升了自主机器人传感系统的测量精度和可靠性，为动态环境下的视觉SLAM提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in
autonomous robotic systems, especially where accurate and reliable measurements
are essential for navigation and sensing. In feature-based SLAM, the
quantityand quality of extracted features significantly influence system
performance. Due to the variations in feature quantity and quality across
diverse environments, current approaches face two major challenges: (1) limited
adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2)
insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies.
To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based
framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware
processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment
mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to
guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive
dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii)
depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal
in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that
dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient.
Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a
weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving
estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world
scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods,
achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse
environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合伪刚体模型（PRBM）和对数减少法（LDM）的方法，用于软体机器人手的高效参数估计和控制，在位置和力控制上都取得了更优的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 软体机器人特别是软手抓取的控制革具挑战性，现有模型存在计算效率低和参数识别复杂的问题，限制了实时应用。

Result: 位置控制器锐失式PID控制器（平均最大锐差4.37度vs20.38度）；力控制在细小物体夹拿任务中优于常规压力控制（土豆片86vs82.5，螺丝刀74.42vs70，黄铜硬币64.75vs35）。

Conclusion: PRBM+LDM是一种计算高效且准确的软体执行器建模技术，能够实现稳定灵活的抓取和精确的力调节。

Abstract: The rapid advancement in physical human-robot interaction (HRI) has
accelerated the development of soft robot designs and controllers. Controlling
soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is challenging due to their
continuous deformation, motivating the use of reduced model-based controllers
for real-time dynamic performance. Most existing models, however, suffer from
computational inefficiency and complex parameter identification, limiting their
real-time applicability. To address this, we propose a paradigm coupling
Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter
estimation (PRBM plus LDM). Using a soft robotic hand test bed, we validate
PRBM plus LDM for predicting position and force output from pressure input and
benchmark its performance. We then implement PRBM plus LDM as the basis for
closed-loop position and force controllers. Compared to a simple PID
controller, the PRBM plus LDM position controller achieves lower error (average
maximum error across all fingers: 4.37 degrees versus 20.38 degrees). For force
control, PRBM plus LDM outperforms constant pressure grasping in pinching tasks
on delicate objects: potato chip 86 versus 82.5, screwdriver 74.42 versus 70,
brass coin 64.75 versus 35. These results demonstrate PRBM plus LDM as a
computationally efficient and accurate modeling technique for soft actuators,
enabling stable and flexible grasping with precise force regulation.

Abstract: Soft robots have been increasingly utilized as sophisticated tools in
physical rehabilitation, particularly for assisting patients with neuromotor
impairments. However, many soft robotics for rehabilitation applications are
characterized by limitations such as slow response times, restricted range of
motion, and low output force. There are also limited studies on the precise
position and force control of wearable soft actuators. Furthermore, not many
studies articulate how bellow-structured actuator designs quantitatively
contribute to the robots' capability. This study introduces a paradigm of upper
limb soft actuator design. This paradigm comprises two actuators: the
Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) for the elbow and the
Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER) for the shoulder. LISPER is
characterized by higher bandwidth, increased output force/torque, and high
linearity. SCASPER is characterized by high output force/torque and simplified
fabrication processes. Comprehensive analytical models that describe the
relationship between pressure, bending angles, and output force for both
actuators were presented so the geometric configuration of the actuators can be
set to modify the range of motion and output forces. The preliminary test on a
dummy arm is conducted to test the capability of the actuators.

Abstract: Multi-agent distributed collaborative mapping provides comprehensive and
efficient representations for robots. However, existing approaches lack
instance-level awareness and semantic understanding of environments, limiting
their effectiveness for downstream applications. To address this issue, we
propose OpenMulti, an open-vocabulary instance-level multi-agent distributed
implicit mapping framework. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Agent Instance
Alignment module, which constructs an Instance Collaborative Graph to ensure
consistent instance understanding across agents. To alleviate the degradation
of mapping accuracy due to the blind-zone optimization trap, we leverage Cross
Rendering Supervision to enhance distributed learning of the scene.
Experimental results show that OpenMulti outperforms related algorithms in both
fine-grained geometric accuracy and zero-shot semantic accuracy. In addition,
OpenMulti supports instance-level retrieval tasks, delivering semantic
annotations for downstream applications. The project website of OpenMulti is

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要同时考虑安全性、舒适性和效率等多个关键指标，但现有方法往往缺乏统一的评估框架。需要开发一个综合性的方法来优化车辆轨迹，确保在各种交通条件下都能达到最佳性能。

Method: 使用基于自适应椭圆的安全区域分析来量化碰撞风险，应用鞋带公式计算不对齐和时间变化配置下的交叉面积。舒适性通过纵向和横向加加速度指标建模，效率通过总行程时间评估。采用粒子群优化(PSO)算法来求解综合目标函数。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization
of autonomous vehicle trajectories, integrating formal safety, comfort, and
efficiency criteria. An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis
of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify
collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the
intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations.
Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk,
while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are
aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based
algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic
conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an
autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation
using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.

Conclusion: 解耦表示方法显著提升元学习的可解释性、泛化能力和实际应用效果

Abstract: In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods rely on implicit
adaptation to task variations, where multiple factors are mixed together in a
single entangled representation. This makes it difficult to interpret which
factors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we
introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly
assigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these
variations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding
and enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks
with shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a
sinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on
out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing
context vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a
quadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties
and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By
transferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into
reinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under
out-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single
unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables
successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with
out-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real
data from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) has made great progress with large language

long-horizon tasks and dynamic scenes. To address this, we propose TopoNav, a
new framework that leverages topological structures as spatial memory. By
building and updating a topological graph that captures scene connections,
adjacency, and semantic meaning, TopoNav helps agents accumulate spatial
knowledge over time, retrieve key information, and reason effectively toward
distant goals. Our experiments show that TopoNav achieves state-of-the-art
performance on benchmark ObjectNav datasets, with higher success rates and more
efficient paths. It particularly excels in diverse and complex environments, as
it connects temporary visual inputs with lasting spatial understanding.

Conclusion: FGO-SLAM系统有效解决了高斯SLAM的位姿优化和几何重建问题，为具身AI提供了高质量的感知能力和仿真测试数据。

Abstract: Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual
capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional
SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction,
and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality
mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face
challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce
FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the
scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial
pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse
point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we
maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and
introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene
representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify
level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across
various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.

Conclusion: 通过简单的网络扩展来推断测量不确定性，可以在低计算成本下显著改善状态估计精度，为机器人实时应用提供了可靠的不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

Conclusion: 所提出的混合输入深度强化学习方法能够有效提升自动驾驶车辆换道决策的合理性和安全性，为复杂交通环境下的自动驾驶提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Lane change decision-making for autonomous vehicles is a complex but
high-reward behavior. In this paper, we propose a hybrid input based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which realizes abstract lane change
decisions and lane change actions for autonomous vehicles within traffic flow.
Firstly, a surrounding vehicles trajectory prediction method is proposed to
reduce the risk of future behavior of surrounding vehicles to ego vehicle, and
the prediction results are input into the reinforcement learning model as
additional information. Secondly, to comprehensively leverage environmental
information, the model extracts feature from high-dimensional images and
low-dimensional sensor data simultaneously. The fusion of surrounding vehicle
trajectory prediction and multi-modal information are used as state space of
reinforcement learning to improve the rationality of lane change decision.
Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning macro decisions with end-to-end
vehicle control to achieve a holistic lane change process. Experiments were
conducted within the CARLA simulator, and the results demonstrated that the
utilization of a hybrid state space significantly enhances the safety of
vehicle lane change decisions.

Motivation: 当前基于检索的伪装学习方法在选择前期数据时存在两个问题：依赖高方差的最近邻估计容易受噪声影响，且没有考虑前期数据的分布特征

Method: 提出重要性权重检索(IWR)方法，使用高斯核密度估计来计算目标数据分布与前期数据分布的比值，通过考虑概率比值来减少偏差并平滑估计

Conclusion: IWR方法通过更好地利用前期数据分布信息，有效解决了传统检索方法的限制，为少数样本伪装学习提供了更有效的数据选择策略

Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for
deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot
imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts
relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a
limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior
datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data
point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.
While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data
selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two
shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on
high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,
it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To
address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which
estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data
distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the
probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,
and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates
using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world
evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently
improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only
requiring minor modifications.

Conclusion: MoTo成功实现了零样本移动操作，无需移动操作专家数据，为移动操作提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots
to assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments.
Conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across
different tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training.
However, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate
impressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation
tasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a
plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf
manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability.
Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate
robot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot
ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language
models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic
arm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can
be employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base
and robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and
maintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the
robot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be
successfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory
optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any
requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results
on OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68%
and 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods,
respectively, without requiring additional training data.

Motivation: 现有关节估计方法主要局限于受控环境，假设固定相机视角或直接观测不同物体状态，在真实无约束环境中容易失败。而人类通过观察他人操作物体就能轻松推断关节结构，这启发了本研究的思路。

Method: 结合深度点跟踪与因子图优化框架，直接从原始RGB-D视频中估计关节部件轨迹和关节轴。同时提出了首个以自我为中心的在野数据集Arti4D，包含场景级关节物体交互数据、关节标签和真实相机位姿。

Conclusion: ArtiPoint为解决动态相机运动和部分观测条件下的关节物体估计问题提供了有效解决方案，Arti4D数据集的发布将推动该领域的未来研究。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Motivation: 现有的机器人基础模型虽然具有端到端和通用能力，但缺乏明确的行为正确性和安全约束概念，需要解决这些数据驱动模型的安全限制

Conclusion: 该约束解码框架有效解决了机器人基础模型的安全性问题，为行为正确性和安全约束提供了可证明的保障

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to
promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These
models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-
modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then
executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the
perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are
still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral
correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing
a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces
logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method
ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the
underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our
approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show
that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe
actions but also for conditional action-generation. Videos available on our

Conclusion: Fail2Progress在不同物体数量的情况下都能有效从故障中学习，并且优于多个基线方法

Abstract: Skill effect models for long-horizon manipulation tasks are prone to failures
in conditions not covered by training data distributions. Therefore, enabling
robots to reason about and learn from failures is necessary. We investigate the
problem of efficiently generating a dataset targeted to observed failures.
After fine-tuning a skill effect model on this dataset, we evaluate the extent
to which the model can recover from failures and minimize future failures. We
propose Fail2Progress, an approach that leverages Stein variational inference
to generate multiple simulation environments in parallel, enabling efficient
data sample generation similar to observed failures. Our method is capable of
handling several challenging mobile manipulation tasks, including transporting
multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf, and tabletop organization.
Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach excels at learning from failures across different numbers of
objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法易于在标准RL流程中实现，适用于任何策略梯度方法，为能量高效控制策略提供了基于原理的替代方案

Abstract: Efficient robot control often requires balancing task performance with energy
expenditure. A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize
energy use directly as part of the reward function. This requires carefully
tuning weight terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization
harms task success. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient
optimization method to minimize energy expenditure without conflicting with
task performance. Inspired by recent works in multitask learning, our method
applies policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives to derive
policy updates that minimize energy expenditure in ways that do not impact task
performance. We evaluate this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of
DM-Control and HumanoidBench and demonstrate a reduction of 64% energy usage
while maintaining comparable task performance. Further, we conduct experiments
on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient
policies. Our method is easy to implement in standard RL pipelines with minimal
code changes, is applicable to any policy gradient method, and offers a
principled alternative to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.

general robot manipulation that generates precise, high-dimensional actions
conditioned on diverse visual, language and proprioceptive inputs. We leverage
flow matching with consistency training to enable high-quality dexterous action

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational
awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are
constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel
interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We
present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction
with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the
framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future
trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical
features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations
for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both
local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale
real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates
superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement
errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework
further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to
strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary
surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is
studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of
performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging
Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission
complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and
efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission
objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study
presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration,
integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a
scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical
scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key
capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework
which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo
simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its
robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system
feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior
execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is
middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and
extending beyond aerial robotics.

Motivation: 针对具有对称性的机械系统（包括无约束和约束系统），传统滑模控制在李群上设计时面临坐标表示复杂和设计难度大的问题，需要一种简化的控制设计方法

Conclusion: 该框架有效降低了滑模控制的设计复杂度，避免了特定李群坐标表示的困难选择，为对称机械系统提供了通用的控制设计方法

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for designing sliding mode controllers
for a class of mechanical systems with symmetry, both unconstrained and
constrained, that evolve on principal fiber bundles. Control laws are developed
based on the reduced motion equations by exploring symmetries, leading to a
sliding mode control strategy where the reaching stage is executed on the base
space, and the sliding stage is performed on the structure group. Thus, design
complexity is reduced, and difficult choices for coordinate representations
when working with a particular Lie group are avoided. For this purpose, a
sliding subgroup is constructed on the structure group based on a kinematic
controller, and the sliding variable will converge to the identity of the state
manifold upon reaching the sliding subgroup. A reaching law based on a general
sliding vector field is then designed on the base space using the local form of
the mechanical connection to drive the sliding variable to the sliding
subgroup, and its time evolution is given according to the appropriate
covariant derivative. Almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential
stability are demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis. We apply the results to a
fully actuated system (a rigid spacecraft actuated by reaction wheels) and a
subactuated nonholonomic system (unicycle mobile robot actuated by wheels),
which is also simulated for illustration.

Abstract: Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially
snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across
conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use.
In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap
between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective
denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose
estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time
applications.
  To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that
evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective
detection of sparse and discrete noise.
  We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive
point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local
regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity
threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and
then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight
prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is
trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various
scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear
and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and
paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across
a wider range of environmental conditions.

Conclusion: ATE提供了一个通用且轻量级的解决方案，大大增强了VLA模型部署到新机器人平台和任务的实用性

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets
show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a
primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks,
especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the
pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action
distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning.
To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer
(\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation
framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a
unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL
divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action
latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's
generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the
model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive
experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation
and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our
method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in
simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a
real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and
lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA
models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性、鲁棒性和高效性，为机器人系统基础参数识别提供了具有几何直观性的解析解决方案，理论复杂度达到O(1)。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel geometric method for analytically determining the
base inertial parameters of robotic systems. The rigid body dynamics is
reformulated using projective geometric algebra, leading to a new
identification model named ``tetrahedral-point (TP)" model. Based on the rigid
body TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model
are derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations.
Building directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for
base parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points
principle, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms
are developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core
algorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG),
achieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity
preprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed
method and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a
2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all
cases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base
parameters. Notably, the approach demonstrates high robustness and
computational efficiency, particularly in the cases of PKMs. Through the
comprehensive demonstrations, the method is shown to be general, robust, and
efficient.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人社交导航提供了新的学习框架，能够实现更好的社交接受度

Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in
recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent
along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and
predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really
be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms
that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated
learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value
(HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social
navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path
planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common
social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of
generalizing to further human activities.

Abstract: The performance of industrial robotic work cells depends on optimizing
various hyperparameters referring to the cell layout, such as robot base
placement, tool placement, and kinematic design. Achieving this requires a
bilevel optimization approach, where the high-level optimization adjusts these
hyperparameters, and the low-level optimization computes robot motions.
However, computing the optimal robot motion is computationally infeasible,
introducing trade-offs in motion planning to make the problem tractable. These
trade-offs significantly impact the overall performance of the bilevel
optimization, but their effects still need to be systematically evaluated. In
this paper, we introduce metrics to assess these trade-offs regarding
optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency. Through extensive
simulation studies, we investigate how simplifications in motion-level
optimization affect the high-level optimization outcomes, balancing
computational complexity with solution quality. The proposed algorithms are
applied to find the time-optimal kinematic design for a modular robot in two
palletization scenarios.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
revolutionised embodied artificial intelligence, enabling advanced
decision-making and adaptability. However, ensuring reliability, encompassing
both security against adversarial attacks and safety in complex environments,
remains a critical challenge. To address this, we propose a unified framework
that mitigates prompt injection attacks while enforcing operational safety
through robust validation mechanisms. Our approach combines prompt assembling,
state management, and safety validation, evaluated using both performance and
security metrics. Experiments show a 30.8% improvement under injection attacks
and up to a 325% improvement in complex environment settings under adversarial
conditions compared to baseline scenarios. This work bridges the gap between
safety and security in LLM-based robotic systems, offering actionable insights
for deploying reliable LLM-integrated mobile robots in real-world settings. The

Abstract: Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous
navigation. While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g.,
camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual
occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In
this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the
risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration
capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as
a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and
accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance
signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based
hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts
then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically
designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data.
We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a
self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic
prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously
reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively.
Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate
classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing
methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate
3D radar perception.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects presents
significant challenges due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and
the need for accurate vision-language grounding. In this work, we focus on
multi-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task
that requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual
perception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large
Language Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based
perception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based
planner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action
primitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with
action, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a
SigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion
mechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to
achieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In
simulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3
on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a
real robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language
instructions across diverse cloth materials and configurations, demonstrating
strong generalization in practical scenarios. Project page:

Abstract: Optical microrobots actuated by optical tweezers (OT) offer great potential
for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and microscale assembly.
These tasks demand accurate three-dimensional perception to ensure precise
control in complex and dynamic biological environments. However, the
transparent nature of microrobots and low-contrast microscopic imaging
challenge conventional deep learning methods, which also require large
annotated datasets that are costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we
propose a physics-informed, data-efficient framework for depth estimation of
optical microrobots. Our method augments convolutional feature extraction with
physics-based focus metrics, such as entropy, Laplacian of Gaussian, and
gradient sharpness, calculated using an adaptive grid strategy. This approach
allocates finer grids over microrobot regions and coarser grids over background
areas, enhancing depth sensitivity while reducing computational complexity. We
evaluate our framework on multiple microrobot types and demonstrate significant
improvements over baseline models. Specifically, our approach reduces mean
squared error (MSE) by over 60% and improves the coefficient of determination
(R^2) across all test cases. Notably, even when trained on only 20% of the
available data, our model outperforms ResNet50 trained on the full dataset,
highlighting its robustness under limited data conditions. Our code is

Motivation: 机器人软件集成耗时且困难，现有系统通常紧密耦合，即使小的改动也需要大量工程投入，阻碍了系统适应性和重用性。

Method: Coral作为抽象层，通过语义约束的集成过程来构建、部署和协调独立软件组件，补充而非替代现有工具。

Conclusion: Coral为广泛的机器人系统集成挑战提供了可扩展解决方案，通过实现实际可组合性改善了机器人软件开发。

Abstract: Despite the multitude of excellent software components and tools available in
the robotics and broader software engineering communities, successful
integration of software for robotic systems remains a time-consuming and
challenging task for users of all knowledge and skill levels. And with robotics
software often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor
alterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or
deploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help
solve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for
building, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that
maximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying
low-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by
introducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process
to semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without
limiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral
in detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of
increasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion
mitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software,
Coral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system
integration challenges, improving component reusability, system
reconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users. We
release Coral open source.

Conclusion: 该分类方法为视觉触觉传感器研究提供了系统框架，揭示了技术发展中的关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in
robotic hands, grippers and prosthetics due to their high spatial resolution,
low manufacturing costs, and ease of customization. While VBTSs have common
design features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity
of sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data
interpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that
categorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the
underlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based
Transduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle.
Marker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker
displacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based
Transduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values.
Depending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be
further divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological
Marker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction
Principle encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent
Layer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the
hardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various
combination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting
tactile information. This~comparison reveals some current challenges faced by
VBTS technology and directions for future research.

Motivation: 解决现代机器人操作主要依赖于2D视觉观测导致的精度和通用性问题，而人类依赖于3D物理属性进行交互，深度摄像头能提供类似的3D几何信息，但存在噪声和准确性问题

Method: 提出Camera Depth Models(CDMs)模型，作为深度摄像头的插件，输入RGB图像和原始深度信号，输出去噪后的准确深度值。通过模拟深度摄像头的噪声模式，构建高质量的模拟-771f实对照数据集

Result: CDMs在深度预测上达到了接近模拟级别的准确度，有效缩小了模拟-真实间距。仅使用模拟深度训练的策略，无需添加噪声或真实世界微调，就能在真实机器人上完成包含关节、反射、细长对象的长期望任务，性能减退微小

Conclusion: 这个方法为利用模拟数据和3D信息来提升机器人操作策略的通用性提供了新的视角，有望推动以深度信息为基础的机器人学习方法的发展

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

Abstract: Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to
renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with
low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages.
This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize
renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns
in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy
demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S.
cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions.
Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies
including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics.
Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9%
renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations
by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the
highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive
performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that
fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing
overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity
considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power

Abstract: Amid global interest in resilient energy systems, green hydrogen is
considered vital to the net-zero transition, yet its deployment remains limited
by high production cost. The cost is determined by the its production pathway,
system configuration, asset location, and interplay with electricity markets
and regulatory frameworks. To compare different deployment strategies in the
UK, we develop a comprehensive techno-economic framework based on the Levelised
Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) assessment. We apply this framework to 5 configurations
of wind-electrolyser systems, identify the most cost-effective business cases,
and conduct a sensitivity analysis of key economic parameters. Our results
reveal that electricity cost is the dominant contributor to LCOH, followed by
the electrolyser cost. Our work highlights the crucial role that location,
market arrangements and control strategies among RES and hydrogen investors
play in the economic feasibility of deploying green hydrogen systems. Policies
that subsidise low-cost electricity access and optimise deployment can lower
LCOH, enhancing the economic competitiveness of green hydrogen.

Abstract: The transition to sustainable energy is critical for addressing global
climate change. Hydrogen production, particularly via electrolysis, has emerged
as a key solution, offering the potential for low-carbon energy across various
sectors. This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing hydrogen production
by aligning it with periods of low-carbon intensity on the electricity grid.
Leveraging real-time data from the Electricity Mapping database and real-time
electricity cost data from the AEMO database, the model dynamically adjusts
hydrogen output to minimize both emissions and production costs. Furthermore,
the integration of hydrogen tax credits significantly enhances
cost-effectiveness, offering a viable pathway for widespread adoption. A
comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework is employed to assess the
environmental impacts, emphasizing the need for real-time data incorporation to
more accurately reflect hydrogen production's carbon footprint. The study
concludes that dynamic, real-time operation, coupled with financial incentives,
provides a promising method to enhance the sustainability and economic
viability of hydrogen production.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一个电动汽车充电预约的两阶段市场模型，讨论了不同机制的性能并提出了一种结合VCG招标和指定价格机制的方案，在估值高相关性时实现高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电动汽车在充电预约市场和实时市场中的机制设计问题，考虑到动机兼容性、效率、预约意识和预算平衡等多项规范性质。

Method: 构建两阶段市场模型，分析VCG机制的两种变体，提出使用指定价格机制来解决预算平衡问题，并在日前市场中使用VCG招标来指嫻实时市场的预约价格。

Result: 发现经典VCG机制变体无法同时满足所有性能要求，指定价格机制虽然缺乏效率保证但满足其他性能。当估值高相关时，提出的结合方案能够实现高效率结果。

Conclusion: 通过在日前市场使用VCG招标来指定实时市场的预约价格，可以在保持其他性能的同时提高系统效率，尤其是在估值高相关的情况下。

Abstract: We propose a general two-period model where electrical vehicles (EVs) can
reserve charging sessions in the day-ahead market and swap them in the
real-time market. Under the model, we explore several candidate mechanisms for
running the two markets, compared using several normative properties such as
incentive compatibility, efficiency, reservation awareness, and budget balance.
Specifically, reservation awareness is the only property coupling the two
markets and dictates that an EV will not get a lower utility by joining the
real-time market. Focusing on the real-time market, we show that two variants
of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism do not satisfy all the
proposed properties; specifically, one is not reservation-aware, while the
other is not budget-balanced. Moreover, we show that no mechanism satisfies
some combinations of the properties. Then, we propose to use a posted-price
mechanism to resolve the issue, which turns out to be the dynamic pricing
mechanism adopted in many real-world systems. The proposed mechanism has no
efficiency guarantee but satisfies all the other properties. To improve
efficiency, we propose to use a VCG auction in the day-ahead market that guides
the reserve prices in the real-time market. When EVs' valuations in the two
markets are highly correlated, the proposed approach results in highly
efficient outcomes.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种不对称多级电路方案，通过策略性分配不同模块电压来实现高分辨率脉冲形成，在减少模块数量的同时提高了输出质量。


<details>

Motivation: 非侵入性脑刺激需要充足高功率和宽带宽的电力电子设备。虽然模块化级联功率电子学解决了随意刺激形成问题，但需要大量模块才能达到高输出质量。

Method: 提出高功率宽带宽电压不对称方案，通过为每个模块策略性分配不同电压来实现近指数收益的分辨率提升。采用开关电容充电机制，允许模块通过单一直流供电充电到不同电压。还定制了不对称电压序列以适应输出。

Conclusion: 这是首个作为高精度高功率合成器的不对称多级电路，同时也是首次在模块化功率电子学中实现适应性优化不对称电压序列的研究。

Abstract: Noninvasive brain stimulation can write signals into neurons but requires
power electronics with exceptionally high power in the mega-volt-ampere range
and kilohertz usable bandwidth. Whereas oscillator circuits offered only one or
very few pulse shapes, modular cascaded power electronics solved a
long-standing problem for the first time and enabled arbitrary software-based
synthesis of the temporal shape of stimuli. However, synthesizing arbitrary
stimuli with a high output quality requires a large number of modules. We
propose an alternative solution that achieves high-resolution pulse shaping
with fewer modules by implementing high-power wide-bandwidth voltage asymmetry.
Rather than equal voltage steps, our system strategically assigns different
voltages to each module to achieve a near-exponential improvement in
resolution. The module voltage sequence does also not use just a simple binary
pattern other work might suggest but adapts it to the output. Additionally, we
introduce a switched-capacitor charging mechanism that allows the modules to
charge to different voltages through a single dc power supply. We validated our
design in a head-to-head comparison with the state of the art on experimental
prototypes. Our three-module prototype reduces total voltage distortion by
13.4% compared to prior art with three modules, and by 4.5% compared to prior
art with six -- twice as many -- modules. This paper is the first asymmetric
multilevel circuit as a high-precision high-power synthesizer, as well as the
first to adaptively optimize asymmetric voltage sequence in modular power
electronics.

TL;DR: 本文通过分层控制视角统一了简化模型(ROM)和全阶模型(FOM)在腿部机器人步态合成中的方法，建立了ROM产生稳定行走的充分条件，并证明了ROM中的稳定周期轨道可转化为FOM的输入-状态稳定周期轨道。

Motivation: 虽然简化模型(ROM)在腿部机器人动态步态合成中很有效，但缺乏使用全阶模型(FOM)方法(如混合零动态)所具有的形式化保证。本文旨在通过分层控制视角统一这两种方法。

Method: 给定ROM后，合成一个编码ROM行为的零动态流形，设计控制器将FOM驱动到这个表面，从而产生混合零动态。证明ROM中的稳定周期轨道意味着FOM混合零动态的输入-状态稳定周期轨道。

Result: 在仿真中验证了线性倒立摆ROM和5连杆平面行走FOM的结果，表明该方法能够成功地将ROM的稳定性保证扩展到FOM。

Conclusion: 本文建立了ROM产生稳定行走的正式条件，通过分层控制方法成功地将简化模型的优势与全阶模型的保证相结合，为腿部机器人的步态合成提供了理论框架和实践验证。

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide a powerful means of synthesizing dynamic
walking gaits on legged robots. Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees
enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis,
e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a
layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a
ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To
achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold
encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive
the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable
periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of
the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is
demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link
planar walking FOM.

Abstract: We deal with controlling the spread of an epidemic disease on a network by
isolating one or multiple locations by banning people from leaving them. To
this aim, we build on the susceptible-infected-susceptible and the
susceptible-infected-removed discrete-time network models, encapsulating a
control action that captures mobility bans via removing links from the network.
Then, we formulate the problem of optimally devising a control policy based on
mobility bans that trades-off the burden on the healthcare system and the
social and economic costs associated with interventions. The binary nature of
mobility bans hampers the possibility to solve the control problem with
standard optimization methods, yielding a NP-hard problem. Here, this is
tackled by deriving a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
formulation of the control problem, and leveraging the growing potentialities
of quantum computing to efficiently solve it.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于最优潮流问题，还具有更广泛的适用范围，包括锥规划、稀疏图问题以及约束量子机器学习模型的训练。

Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is
central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as
a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of
modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this
context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF.
We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit
(PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with
a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled
expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by
minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second
PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients
of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are
updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal
variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them
to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system
using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational
quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for
the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with
numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and
training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.

TL;DR: 本文分析了电网跟随型逆变器在低电压穿越控制下，由于锁相环误差导致的电压角度耦合问题，提出了功率角度解耦的低电压穿越控制方法来解决过电压、低电压和直流侧过电压问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于逆变器的资源快速普及，电网跟随型逆变器在低电压穿越控制下的电压支撑能力对电力系统暂态电压稳定性有重要影响。现有LVRT控制通过调节q轴电流来调整无功功率注入，但在大扰动下锁相环误差会导致实际无功功率注入偏差，影响暂态电压。

Conclusion: 提出的功率角度解耦LVRT控制方法有效消除了电压角度耦合的影响，提高了逆变器在低电压穿越期间的电压支撑能力，增强了电力系统的暂态电压稳定性。

Abstract: With the fast-increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs), the
voltage support capability of the grid following (GFL) IBRs under low voltage
ride through (LVRT) control significantly influences the transient voltage
stability of the power system. The existing LVRT adjusts the q-axis current to
regulate reactive power injection. However, under a large disturbance, the
phase-locked loop (PLL) error invalidates the proportional relationship between
the q-axis current and reactive power, consequently causing deviation in the
actual reactive power injection of the IBR. Besides, the variation of IBR
current, determined by the PLL phase and LVRT, also directly influences the
transient voltage. To address this issue, the specific influence of PLL error
on active and reactive power injection is first analyzed under LVRT control. In
addition, by combining the LVRT and PLL dynamics, the mechanisms of three
voltage problems caused by voltage angle coupling are revealed. overvoltage,
low voltage, and DC-side overvoltage. The specific scenarios in which these
voltage stability problems occur are also obtained by the
voltage-vector-triangle graphic. Furthermore, a power angle decoupled LVRT
control is proposed to eliminate the influence of voltage angle coupling.
Finally, the mechanism analysis and effectiveness of the decoupled LVRT are
verified in the case study.

Conclusion: 提出的改进PLL设计通过重置控制和李雅普诺夫触发机制，有效提升了网格随从变换器的过渡稳定性和同步能力

Abstract: Fluctuations in phase angle and frequency under large disturbances can lead
to loss of synchronism (LOS) in grid-following (GFL) converters. The power
angle and frequency of synchronous generators (SGs) correspond to rotor
position and speed, whereas those of converters lack a direct physical
counterpart in the real world and can thus be directly adjusted by control
methods to prevent loss of synchronization. In this paper, an improved
phase-locked loop (PLL) design with reset control for GFL converters is
proposed to enhance transient stability. The stability domain (SD) of a GFL
converter is first analyzed, and three forms of SD are identified under
different short circuit ratios. Secondly, based on the characteristics of the
three SD forms, two PLL-reset methods are proposed, including omega reset and
omega&delta reset. Thirdly, to provide the triggering conditions for the
PLL-reset control, the Lyapunov function of the GFL converter is constructed
based on three methods: the approximation-based Lyapunov method, the Zubov
method, and the analytical trajectory reversing method. All these methods are
immune to the negative damping problem of PLL dynamics, which makes traditional
energy-perspective Lyapunov functions invalid. Finally, the estimation accuracy
of the three Lyapunov-based methods is analyzed, and the effectiveness of the
PLL-reset control is verified in single-machine and multi-machine case studies.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种生物学或社会学上合理的自适应过程，通过重用现有耦合信号实现异构系统的参数对齐和精确同步

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptation mechanism for heterogeneous multi-agent
systems to align the agents' internal parameters, based on enforced consensus
through strong couplings. Unlike homogeneous systems, where exact consensus is
attainable, the heterogeneity in node dynamics precludes perfect
synchronization. Nonetheless, previous work has demonstrated that strong
coupling can induce approximate consensus, whereby the agents exhibit emergent
collective behavior governed by the so-called blended dynamics. Building on
this observation, we introduce an adaptation law that gradually aligns the
internal parameters of agents without requiring direct parameter communication.
The proposed method reuses the same coupling signal employed for state
synchronization, which may result in a biologically or sociologically plausible
adaptation process. Under a persistent excitation condition, we prove that the
linearly parametrized vector fields of the agents converge to each other,
thereby making the dynamics asymptotically homogeneous, and leading to exact
consensus of the state variables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着微电网中分布式能源和网络连接的增多，协同网络攻击对电力系统安全构成严重威胁，需要开发能够快速适应攻击策略并确保物理约束的弹性防御框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a physics-aware cyberphysical resilience framework for
radial microgrids under coordinated cyberattacks. The proposed approach models
the attacker through a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) enhanced with model
agnostic metalearning (MAML) to rapidly adapt to evolving defense strategies
and predict high-impact contingencies. The defender is modeled via a bi-level
Stackelberg game, where the upper level selects optimal tie-line switching and
distributed energy resource (DER) dispatch using an Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) coordinator embedded within the Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The framework simultaneously optimizes
load served, operational cost, and voltage stability, ensuring all post-defense
states satisfy network physics constraints. The methodology is first validated
on the IEEE 69-bus distribution test system with 12 DERs, 8 critical loads, and
5 tie-lines, and then extended to higher bus systems including the IEEE 123-bus
feeder and a synthetic 300-bus distribution system. Results show that the
proposed defense strategy restores nearly full service for 90% of top-ranked
attacks, mitigates voltage violations, and identifies Feeder 2 as the principal
vulnerability corridor. Actionable operating rules are derived, recommending
pre-arming of specific tie-lines to enhance resilience, while higher bus system
studies confirm scalability of the framework on the IEEE 123-bus and 300-bus
systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates a passivity-based approach to output consensus
analysis in heterogeneous networks composed of non-identical agents coupled via
nonlinear interactions, in the presence of measurement and/or communication
noise. Focusing on agents that are input-feedforward passive (IFP), we first
examine whether a shortage of passivity in some agents can be compensated by a
passivity surplus in others, in the sense of preserving the passivity of the
transformed open-loop system defined by the agent dynamics and network
topology. We show that such compensation is only feasible when at most one
agent lacks passivity, and we characterise how this deficit can be offset using
the excess passivity within the group of agents. For general networks, we then
investigate passivity compensation within the feedback interconnection by
leveraging the passivity surplus in the coupling links to locally compensate
for the lack of passivity in the adjacent agents. In particular, a distributed
condition, expressed in terms of passivity indices and coupling gains, is
derived to ensure output consensus of the interconnected network.

Motivation: 传统观点认为电力系统规模越大，频率控制性能越好，但这项研究想要验证这种观点在现代再生能源系统中是否仍然成立，并找出影响频率控制效果的关键因素。

Method: 采用实际测量数据，通过多种频率质量指标来评估四个同步岛屿电力系统（英国、爱尔兰全岛、澳大利亚大陆和塔斯马尼亚）的频率控制强度，分析正常和异常运行条件下的系统表现。

Result: 研究发现：正常运行条件下，澳大利亚大陆系统显示出最高的频率控制强度；而在异常条件下，爱尔兰全岛系统显示出最高的相对频率控制强度。系统规模并非唯一决定因素，监管要求和辅助服务安排才是关键影响因素。

Conclusion: 频率控制效果主要受制于各地的监管要求和系统服务安排，而非系统规模大小。通过优化网络规程和市场规则，可以有效提升各地电力系统的频率控制强度。

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of "frequency control strength" as a novel
approach to understand how different real-world power systems compare to each
other in terms of effectiveness and performance of system-wide frequency
control. It presents a comprehensive comparison, based on measurement data, of
the frequency control strength of four real-world, renewable-based, synchronous
islands power systems, namely Great Britain (GB), All-Island power system
(AIPS) of Ireland, and Australia (AUS) mainland and Tasmania (TAS). The
strength is evaluated by means of different frequency quality metrics. The
common understanding is that the bigger the capacity of a power system, the
bigger its robustness with respect to events and contingencies. Here we show
that this is not always the case in the context of frequency control. In fact,
our study shows that mainland AUS shows the highest frequency control strength
during normal operating conditions, whereas the AIPS shows the highest relative
frequency control strength for abnormal system conditions. The strength is, in
particular, greatly influenced by different regulatory requirements and
different system/ancillary services arrangements in each jurisdiction. The
paper also provides possible mitigations to improve frequency control strength
through grid codes and market rules.

Abstract: Accurate depth measurement is essential for optimizing oil and gas resource
development, as it directly impacts production efficiency. However, achieving
precise depth and perforating at the correct location remains a significant
challenge due to field operational constraints and equipment limitations. In
this work, we propose the Dynamic Threshold and Physical Plausibility Depth
Measurement and Perforation Control (DTPPMP) system, a solution integrated into
perforating guns that enables real-time, precise depth measurement and
perforation at designated perforating intervals. The system autonomously
samples, processes and identifies signals from a casing collar locator (CCL) in
situ within oil and gas wells. Casing collar identification is achieved using a
lightweight dynamic threshold and physical plausibility algorithm deployed on
an embedded platform, which serves as the system's processor. Field tests
conducted in an actual oil well in Sichuan, China, demonstrated the DTPPMP's
ability to accurately identify casing collar signals, measure depths, and
effectively perforate at designated perforating intervals in real-time. The
system achieved a perforation variation of less than the length of a single
perforating interval and a F1 score of 98.6% for casing collar identification.
These results provide valuable recommendations for advancing automation and
intelligence in future perforation operations.

Abstract: Recent work has proposed machine learning (ML) approaches as fast surrogates
for solving AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF), with claims of significant
speed-ups and high accuracy. In this paper, we revisit these claims through a
systematic evaluation of ML models against a set of simple yet carefully
designed linear baselines. We introduce OPFormer-V, a transformer-based model
for predicting bus voltages, and compare it to both the state-of-the-art
DeepOPF-V model and simple linear methods. Our findings reveal that, while
OPFormer-V improves over DeepOPF-V, the relative gains of the ML approaches
considered are less pronounced than expected. Simple linear baselines can
achieve comparable performance. These results highlight the importance of
including strong linear baselines in future evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LQG控制器在噪声分布偏离高斯假设时性能显著下降，需要一种对噪声分布不确定性具有鲁棒性的控制方法

Method: 使用熵正则化Wasserstein距离定义模糊集，建立新的Sinkhorn差异界限，证明线性策略的全局最优性

Result: 数值实验表明所提出的控制策略具有改进的分布鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了LQG控制框架，为处理非高斯噪声提供了有效的分布鲁棒解决方案

Abstract: The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator is a cornerstone of optimal
control theory, yet its performance can degrade significantly when the noise
distributions deviate from the assumed Gaussian model. To address this
limitation, this work proposes a distributionally robust generalization of the
finite-horizon LQG control problem. Specifically, we assume that the noise
distributions are unknown and belong to ambiguity sets defined in terms of an
entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance centered at a nominal Gaussian
distribution. By deriving novel bounds on this Sinkhorn discrepancy and proving
structural and topological properties of the resulting ambiguity sets, we
establish global optimality of linear policies. Numerical experiments showcase
improved distributional robustness of our control policy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交网络中多模态信念和观点不确定性的形成与演化机制，特别是在存在固执个体（社交影响者）的情况下，探索信息流动的干扰效应。

Method: 采用高斯混合模型，结合贝叶斯信念更新（处理外部信号如新闻文章）和非贝叶斯混合动态（处理社交媒体互动），建立多模态观点动态模型。

Result: 初步结果显示，固执个体作为社交影响者能够显著影响观点形成和不确定性，并提出了基于个体干扰信息流动难易程度的中枢性概念。

Conclusion: 该模型成功捕捉了多模态观点动态的复杂性，同时保持了模型的简洁性和可解释性，为理解社交网络中信息传播和观点演化提供了新的分析框架。

Abstract: We use Gaussian mixtures to model formation and evolution of multi-modal
beliefs and opinion uncertainty across social networks. In this model, opinions
evolve by Bayesian belief update when incorporating exogenous factors (signals
from outside sources, e.g., news articles) and by non-Bayesian mixing dynamics
when incorporating endogenous factors (interactions across social media). The
modeling enables capturing the richness of behavior observed in multi-modal
opinion dynamics while maintaining interpretability and simplicity of scalar
models. We present preliminary results on opinion formation and uncertainty to
investigate the effect of stubborn individuals (as social influencers). This
leads to a notion of centrality based on the ease with which an individual can
disrupt the flow of information across the social network.

Abstract: As Industry 4.0 progresses, flexible manufacturing has become a cornerstone
of modern industrial systems, with equipment automation playing a pivotal role.
However, existing control software for industrial equipment, typically reliant
on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that require human interactions such as
mouse clicks or screen touches, poses significant barriers to the adoption of
code-based equipment automation. Recently, Large Language Model-based General
Computer Control (LLM-GCC) has emerged as a promising approach to automate
GUI-based operations. However, industrial settings pose unique challenges,
including visually diverse, domain-specific interfaces and mission-critical
tasks demanding high precision. This paper introduces IndusGCC, the first
dataset and benchmark tailored to LLM-GCC in industrial environments,
encompassing 448 real-world tasks across seven domains, from robotic arm
control to production line configuration. IndusGCC features multimodal human
interaction data with the equipment software, providing robust supervision for
GUI-level code generation. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation
framework with functional and structural metrics to assess LLM-generated
control scripts. Experimental results on mainstream LLMs demonstrate both the
potential of LLM-GCC and the challenges it faces, establishing a strong
foundation for future research toward fully automated factories. Our data and

Abstract: In biology, homeostasis is the process of maintaining a stable internal
environment, which is crucial for optimal functioning of organisms. One of the
key homeostatic mechanisms is thermoregulation that allows the organism to
maintain its core temperature within tight bounds despite being exposed to a
wide range of varying external temperatures. Instrumental in thermoregulation
is the presence of thermosensitive neurons at multiple places throughout the
body, including muscles, the spinal cord, and the brain, which provide spiking
sensory signals for the core temperature. In response to these signals,
thermoeffectors are activated, creating a negative spiking feedback loop.
Additionally, a feedforward signal is provided by warmth and cold-sensitive
neurons in the skin, offering a measure for the external temperature. This
paper presents an electronic circuit-based architecture design to replicate the
biological process of thermoregulation, combined with a formal mathematical
analysis. The considered architecture consists of four temperature sensitive
neurons and a single actuator, configured in a negative feedback loop with
feedforward control. To model the overall system mathematically, hybrid
dynamical system descriptions are proposed that are used to analyze and
simulate the performance of the design. The analysis and numerical case study
illustrate the crucial role of feedforward control in reducing the dependency
on the external temperature.

Abstract: In this letter, we study the energy-optimal control of nonlinear
port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems in discrete time. For continuous-time pH systems,
energy-optimal control problems are strictly dissipative by design. This
property, stating that the system to be optimized is dissipative with the cost
functional as a supply rate, implies a stable long-term behavior of optimal
solutions and enables stability results in predictive control.
  In this work, we show that the crucial property of strict dissipativity is
not straightforwardly preserved by any energy-preserving integrator such as the
implicit midpoint rule. Then, we prove that discretizations via difference and
differential representations lead to strictly dissipative discrete-time optimal
control problems. Consequently, we rigorously show a stable long-term behavior
of optimal solutions in the form of a manifold (subspace) turnpike property.
Finally, we validate our findings using two numerical examples

Abstract: We study the problem of fault isolation in linear systems with actuator and
sensor faults within a data-driven framework. We propose a nullspace-based

framework, we achieve a direct fault isolation filter design that is
independent of any explicit system model. The underlying classification problem
is approached from a geometric perspective, enabling a characterization of
mutual fault discernibility in terms of fundamental system properties given a
noise-free setting. In addition, the provided conditions can be evaluated using
only the available data. Finally, a simulation study is conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper presents the ConamArray, a compact broadband ultrasound transducer
array composed of 32 MEMS loudspeakers. Unlike conventional broadband
transducers, which are typically large and require high driving voltages, the

Abstract: Magnetic levitation is poised to revolutionize industrial automation by
integrating flexible in-machine product transport and seamless manipulation. It
is expected to become the standard drive for automated manufacturing. However,
controlling such systems is inherently challenging due to their complex,
unstable dynamics. Traditional control approaches, which rely on hand-crafted
control engineering, typically yield robust but conservative solutions, with
their performance closely tied to the expertise of the engineering team. In
contrast, neural control learning presents a promising alternative. This paper
presents the first neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation. Trained
end-to-end on interaction data from a proprietary controller, it directly maps
raw sensor data and 6D reference poses to coil current commands. The neural
controller can effectively generalize to previously unseen situations while
maintaining accurate and robust control. These results underscore the practical
feasibility of learning-based neural control in complex physical systems and
suggest a future where such a paradigm could enhance or even substitute
traditional engineering approaches in demanding real-world applications. The

Abstract: The future grid will be highly complex and decentralized, requiring
sophisticated coordination across numerous human and software agents that
manage distributed resources such as Demand Response (DR). Realizing this
vision demands significant advances in semantic interoperability, which enables
scalable and cost-effective automation across heterogeneous systems. While
semantic technologies have progressed in commercial building and DR domains,
current ontologies have two critical limitations: they are often developed
without a formal framework that reflects real-world DR requirements, and
proposals for integrating general and application-specific ontologies remain
mostly conceptual, lacking formalization or empirical validation.
  In this paper, we address these gaps by applying a formal ontology
evaluation/development approach to define the informational requirements (IRs)
necessary for semantic interoperability in the area of incentive-based DR for
commercial buildings. We identify the IRs associated with each stage of the
wholesale incentive-based DR process, focusing on the perspective of building
owners. Using these IRs, we evaluate how well existing ontologies (Brick,
DELTA, and EFOnt) support the operational needs of DR participation. Our
findings reveal substantial misalignments between current ontologies and
practical DR requirements. Based on our assessments, we propose a roadmap of
necessary extensions and integrations for these ontologies. This work
ultimately aims to enhance the interoperability of today's and future smart
grid, thereby facilitating scalable integration of DR systems into the grid's
complex operational framework.

Conclusion: 实现车辆电气化在过渡期间的完全减排潜力需要适度但有针对性的传输容量增加，强调增强传输基础设施的迫切需求

Abstract: Averting catastrophic global warming requires decisive action to decarbonize
key sectors. Vehicle electrification, alongside renewable energy integration,
is a long-term strategy toward zero carbon emissions. However, transitioning to
fully renewable electricity may take decades -- during which electric vehicles
may still rely on carbon-intensive electricity. We analyze the critical role of
the transmission network in enabling or constraining emissions reduction from
U.S. vehicle electrification. Our models reveal that the available transmission
capacity severely limits potential CO2 emissions reduction. With adequate
transmission, full electrification could nearly eliminate vehicle operational
CO2 emissions once renewable generation reaches the existing nonrenewable
capacity. In contrast, the current grid would support only a fraction of that
benefit. Achieving the full emissions reduction potential of vehicle
electrification during this transition will require a moderate but targeted
increase in transmission capacity. Our findings underscore the pressing need to
enhance transmission infrastructure to unlock the climate benefits of
large-scale electrification and renewable integration.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the key features of a control system applicable to
inverter-based resources (IBR), which is based on grid-forming technology. Such
resources are classified as grid-forming or grid-following converters based on
the type of output with or without grid connection. With rapid growth in the
energy sector to adopt carbon-free generation, Grid Forming Converter (GFC)
seems suitable for power provision to remote or islanded operation of
converters. A fully-fledged bulk power grid based on GFC requires complex
control implementation with suitable tuning of its parameters. In this article
a broader analysis of synchronous machine and such type of converter is
discussed and designed in the MATLAB 2024 environment with its control
technique is studied for a closed-loop system under contingencies. A proposed
control scheme is developed to understand the frequency minimization problem
and the minimization problem is solved using GAMS programming tool. The primary
objective function is found to be suitable for minimization of frequency
deviation using a mixed control approach. An artificial neural network-based
controller is also proposed with Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm which
augments the research by finding suitable optimal reference for GFM converter
in the presence of a grid. A long-short-term memory (LSTM) based network is
also proposed for the above control and the performance is found to be
efficacious.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a mathematical model of a converter
state space model for a hybrid microgrid. The hybrid model combines the models
of components such as DC-Converters, DC-AC converters, and their individual
controllers, as well as loads. The input to the converter is considered a
constant DC voltage, assumed to originate from distributed generations like
solar, battery storage, or fuel-cells. The converter output is connected to a
DC line through an LCL filter. The controller circuitry is designed to regulate
the voltage, current, and power from the converter. Sensors are strategically
placed to measure the currents, voltages, and power, and calculate the
reference pulse signal using PWM for the switch. Similarly, the DC-AC converter
is modeled. In the state space domain the converter models is used to design
overall microgrid system. A single DC converter has six states and two inputs,
with all states as outputs. A single DC-AC converter has thirteen states and
three inputs, with all states as outputs. Three such converters of each type
are considered to develop the DC microgrid and AC microgrid, which are then
combined using mathematical analysis to model a hybrid microgrid. For the
hybrid microgrid development, network and load models were also included.
Eigenvalue analysis has been conducted to study the small signal stability of
the considered system. The complete state space model of the hybrid microgrid
has been programmed, and a pole-placement controller has been designed to
enhance the stability of the system.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a cascade control structure to address the
trajectory tracking problem for quadcopters, ensuring uniform global asymptotic
stability of the state tracking error dynamics. An MPC strategy based on a
12-dimensional prediction model is proposed for the outer loop, explicitly
accounting for time-varying coupled constraints, where multiple variables are
interdependent and need to be handled together. The outer-loop controller
generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and
angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop
controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced
performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative
constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of technological constraints on passive
elements in the design of inductively degenerated CMOS low-noise amplifiers
(LNAs). A theoretical analysis is combined with circuit simulations in a 130-nm
CMOS process at 2.45~GHz to explore how the available inductance and
capacitance values limit key design objectives such as maximum gain, minimum
power consumption, and transistor sizing. Results show that these limits
significantly restrict the achievable design space, particularly for low-power
implementations, and highlight the need to incorporate detailed passive-element
models into RF integrated circuit design flows.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the notion of resilience of a dynamical system,
defined by the maximum disturbance a controlled dynamical system can withstand
while satisfying given temporal logic specifications. Given a dynamical system
and a specification, the objective is to synthesize the controller such that
the closed-loop system satisfies this specification while maximizing its
resilience. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization program where
the objective is to compute the maximum resilience while simultaneously
synthesizing the corresponding controller parameters. For linear systems and
linear controllers, exact solutions are provided for the class of time-varying
polytopic specifications. For the case of nonlinear systems, nonlinear
controllers and more general specifications, we leverage tools from the
scenario optimization approach, offering a probabilistic guarantee of the
solution as well as computational feasibility. Different case studies are
presented to illustrate the theoretical results.

Abstract: Reverse parking maneuvers of a vehicle with trailer system is a challenging
task to complete for human drivers due to the unstable nature of the system and
unintuitive controls required to orientate the trailer properly. This paper
hence proposes an optimization-based automation routine to handle the
path-planning and path-tracking control process of such type of maneuvers. The
proposed approach utilizes nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to
robustly guide the vehicle-trailer system into the desired parking space, and
an optional forward repositioning maneuver can be added as an additional stage
of the parking process to obtain better system configurations, before backward
motion can be attempted again to get a good final pose. The novelty of the
proposed approach is the simplicity of its formulation, as the path-planning
and path-tracking operations are only conducted on the trailer being viewed as
a standalone vehicle, before the control inputs are propagated to the tractor
vehicle via inverse kinematic relationships also derived in this paper.
Simulation case studies and hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed, and the
results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: We propose a resilience-based framework for computing feasible
assume-guarantee contracts that ensure the satisfaction of temporal
specifications in interconnected discrete-time systems. Interconnection effects
are modeled as structured disturbances. We use a resilience metric, the maximum
disturbance under which local specifications hold, to refine assumptions and
guarantees across subsystems iteratively. For two subsystems, we demonstrate
correctness, monotone refinement of guarantees, and that the resulting
assumptions are maximal within ball-shaped sets. Additionally, we extend our
approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of
interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by
meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-time
reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general
finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical
linear examples, and a nonlinear DC Microgrid case study, showcasing the impact
of our framework in verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional
reasoning.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种安全主义的多自主体蒙特卡罗树搜索框架，用于解决自动驾驶汽车在无信号环形交叉口中的决策挑战，特别是在人类驾驶汽车和自动驾驶汽车混合环境下的协同决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号环形交叉口中的决策制定对自动驾驶汽车构成了重大挑战，特别是在混合交通环境下需要与人类驾驶汽车安全协调。现有方法在处理这种复杂场景时遇到困难，需要一种能够结合确定性和概率性预测模型的安全主义框架来提高决策的可靠性和安全性。

Method: 论文提出了一种安全主义的多自主体蒙特卡罗树搜索(MCTS)框架，包含三个核心创新：(1)分层安全评估模块，通过动态安全阈值和时空风险评估来处理AV之间、AV与人类驾驶车、AV与道路之间的交互；(2)适应性人类驾驶行为预测方案，结合智能驾驶模型和概率性不确定性建模；(3)多目标奖励优化策略，同时考虑安全、效率和协作意图。

Result: 模拟实验结果验证了该方法在全自动驾驶(100% AVs)和混合交通(50% AVs + 50% HDVs)条件下的有效性。与基准方法相比，该框架一质地减少了所有AV的轨迹偏差，并显著降低了辅路侵占时间(PET)违规率，在全自动场景中仅为1.0%，在混合交通环境中为3.2%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的安全主义多自主体MCTS框架能够有效地解决无信号环形交叉口中的复杂决策问题，通过结合确定性和概率性预测模型，显著提高了决策的安全性和可靠性，为混合交通环境下的自动驾驶提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Decision-making at unsignalized roundabouts poses substantial challenges for
autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs
must coordinate safely with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper presents a
safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that
integrates both deterministic and probabilistic prediction models to facilitate
cooperative decision-making in complex roundabout scenarios. The proposed
framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical safety
assessment module that systematically addresses AV-to-AV (A2A), AV-to-HDV
(A2H), and AV-to-Road (A2R) interactions through dynamic safety thresholds and
spatiotemporal risk evaluation; (2) an adaptive HDV behavior prediction scheme
that combines the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic uncertainty
modeling; and (3) a multi-objective reward optimization strategy that jointly
considers safety, efficiency, and cooperative intent. Extensive simulation
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully
autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions.
Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory
deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of
Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0\% in the fully
autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.

Conclusion: 该框架将物理知识与数据驱动推理相结合，实现了双驱动范式，与现有基于RSS的定位算法兼容，为非视距非合作信号源定位提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate localization of non-cooperative signal sources in non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge with a wide range of
applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and
emergency response. In such settings, traditional positioning techniques
relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe
multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel
generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional
diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted
electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling
strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at
the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information
and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack
of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to
the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant
radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the
full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization
is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM.
Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based
localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical
knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive
theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach
achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost,
offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS
emitter localization.

Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro identification method that enhances
the robustness of a centralized multi-quadrotor transportation system. This
method leverages online tuning and learning on decomposed error subspaces,
enabling efficient real-time compensation to time-varying disturbances and
model uncertainties acting on the payload. The strategy is to decompose the
high-dimensional error space into a set of low-dimensional subspaces. In this
way, the identification problem for unseen features is naturally transformed
into submappings (``slices'') addressed by multiple adaptive laws and shallow
neural networks, which are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without
requiring persistent excitation (PE) and offline training. Due to the
model-free nature of neural networks, this approach can be well adapted to
highly coupled and nonlinear centralized transportation systems. It serves as a
feedforward compensator for the payload controller without explicitly relying
on the dynamics coupled with the payload, such as cables and quadrotors. The
proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov,
and its enhanced robustness under time-varying disturbances and model
uncertainties was demonstrated by numerical simulations.

Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro geometric control for a centralized

this, we augmented the existing geometric control with multiple neural networks

Motivation: alpha近似是s-z变换的广义形式，当alpha=0.5时即为著名的Tustin变换。为了深入理解这一变换方法的特性和限制，需要进行系统的理论分析。

Method: 采用数学解释方法推导出该方法可通过数值积分误差函数得到（称为六边形近似），进行稳定性分析确定alpha的稳定范围，并通过失真分析研究幅值和相位失真特性。

Result: 确定了alpha的稳定范围为[0.5, 1]；发现无法通过调节单一alpha参数同时最小化所有频率点的幅值和相位失真；提出了相应的排除假设。

Conclusion: 设计alpha参数需要在幅值失真和相位失真之间进行权衡，没有单一的alpha值能够在整个奈奎斯特频率范围内同时最小化两种失真。

Abstract: A popular method for designing digital models is transforming the transfer
function of the corresponding analog models from continuous domain (s-domain)
into discrete domain (z-domain) using the s-to-z transformation. The
alpha-approximation is a generalized form of these transformations. When alpha
is set to 0.5, the result is the well-known Tustin transformation or bi-linear
transformation. In this paper, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the
alpha-approximation method, including mathematical interpretation, stability
analysis and distortion analysis. Through mathematical interpretation, we
revealed that it can be derived by numerically integrating the error function
We defined this as the hexagonal approximation. We demonstrated that the stable
range of alpha was [0.5, 1] by doing stability analysis. Through distortion
analysis, we found that minimizing amplitude and phase distortion
simultaneously seemed impossible by regulating alpha alone. Finally, We
proposed an exclusion hypothesis hypothesizing that there is no single
parameter alpha to minimize the amplitude distortion and phase distortion
simultaneously across all frequency points within the Nyquist frequency range.
This paper demonstrates that designing parameter alpha involves balancing
amplitude and phase distortion.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to robust load disturbance rejection in
DC-DC Buck converters. We propose a novel control scheme based on the design of
two nested feedback loops. First, we design the controller in the outer loop
using H infinity optimal control theory, and we show, by means of mu-analysis,
that such a controller provides robust stability in the presence of uncertainty
affecting the physical parameters of the circuit. Then, we introduce an inner
feedback loop to improve the system's response to output load disturbances. As
far as the inner loop is considered, we propose a novel load
estimation-compensation (LEC) scheme, and we discuss under what conditions the
insertion of such an inner loop preserves the robust stability of the entire
control system. The LEC scheme is compared with the other two linear structures
based on well-established disturbance rejection methods. The advantages of LEC
in terms of both complexity of implementation and obtained performances are
discussed and demonstrated by means of numerical simulation. Finally, we
present experimental results obtained through the implementation of the
proposed control scheme on a prototype board to demonstrate that the proposed
approach significantly enhances disturbance rejection performances with respect
to the approach commonly used in DC-DC buck converters.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for incorporating frequency dynamics
into the unit commitment (UC) problem through a general-order differential
equation model, solved using Bernstein polynomial approximation. Traditional
frequency-constrained UC (FCUC) models typically rely on simplified first-order
assumptions or scalar frequency metrics, such as frequency nadir, to indirectly
enforce dynamic behavior. In contrast, our formulation explicitly models
time-domain frequency response using second-order dynamics, enabling a more
accurate and flexible representation of generator behavior. The resulting
differential equations are approximated with high fidelity using Bernstein
polynomials, leading to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation
that remains computationally tractable for small-scale power systems.
  Additionally, we introduce a new constraint based on the duration of
frequency excursions below a critical threshold, motivated by practical
concerns such as relay operation and equipment protection. A data-driven method
is employed to relate the area under this threshold-computed as the integral of
the Bernstein approximation-to the duration of frequency deviation. The
proposed framework is validated using real-world data from an island system in
Spain, demonstrating enhanced frequency security with a moderate increase in
operational cost. These results suggest the method's strong potential for
application in low-inertia, small-scale power systems.

Abstract: Reset elements are nonlinear filters that improve control performance beyond
linear time-invariant (LTI) limits but introduce higher-order harmonics that
complicate design. Although frequency-domain tools like describing functions
(DFs) and higher-order sinusoidal-input describing functions (HOSIDFs) analyze
reset control systems (RCS), no direct method yet quantifies the impact of
higher-order harmonics on the error signal without time-domain simulations.
This paper introduces a robustness factor, $\sigma_2(\omega)$, which quantifies
the increase in the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the error signal due to
HOSIDFs, enabling RCS to rely solely on first-order DF characteristics while
accounting for nonlinear effects. By using this robustness factor, a systematic
method for designing pre- and post-filters is developed to ensure a predefined
bound on $\sigma_2(\omega)$, thereby limiting the influence of higher-order
harmonics without altering first-order DF behavior. The proposed framework is
validated through a case study on a planar precision positioning stage,
demonstrating how the robustness factor guides the reduction of nonlinearities
and improves performance predictability.

Abstract: In reactor-grade tokamaks, pellet injection is the best candidate for core
plasma fuelling. However, density control schemes that can handle the hybrid
nature of this type of fuelling, i.e., the discrete impact of the pellets on
the continuously evolving plasma density, are lacking. This paper proposes a
neuromorphic controller, inspired by the integrate-and-fire neuronal model, to
address this problem. The overall system is modelled as a hybrid system, and we
analyse the proposed controller in closed loop with a single-input
single-output linear time-invariant plasma model. The controller generates
spikes, representing pellet launches, when the neuron variable reaches a
certain threshold. Between the control actions, or spikes, the system evolves
in open loop. We establish conditions on the controller variables and minimum
actuator speed, depending on the reference value for the desired density, the
pellet size and the time-constant of the plasma density, that guarantee a
practical stability property for the closed-loop system. The results are
illustrated in a numerical example.

Abstract: We investigate the task and motion planning problem for dynamical systems
under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. Existing works on STL control
synthesis mainly focus on generating plans that satisfy properties over a
single executed trajectory. In this work, we consider the planning problem for
hyperproperties evaluated over a set of possible trajectories, which naturally
arise in information-flow control problems. Specifically, we study
discrete-time dynamical systems and employ the recently developed temporal
logic HyperSTL as the new objective for planning. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel recursive counterexample-guided synthesis approach capable of
effectively handling HyperSTL specifications with multiple alternating
quantifiers. The proposed method is not only applicable to planning but also
extends to HyperSTL model checking for discrete-time dynamical systems.
Finally, we present case studies on security-preserving planning and
ambiguity-free planning to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
HyperSTL planning framework.

Motivation: 为了解决电力系统中PMU部署成本高但故障诊断需求迫切的问题，需要找到最优的PMU配置方案来最大化深度学习故障诊断性能

Method: 采用前向选择与邻域细化(FSNR)算法，使用交叉验证SVM对候选PMU位置进行排序，通过局部邻域探索获得近最优传感器集，然后用1D CNN进行故障定位和分类

Conclusion: FSNR-SVM方法能够找到最小PMU配置，实现最佳CNN性能，为电力系统故障诊断提供了高效的传感器部署方案

Abstract: In this paper, we present a data-driven Forward Selection with Neighborhood
Refinement (FSNR) algorithm to determine the number and placement of Phasor
Measurement Units (PMUs) for maximizing deep-learning-based fault diagnosis
performance. Candidate PMU locations are ranked via a cross-validated Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and each selection is refined through local
neighborhood exploration to produce a near-optimal sensor set. The resulting
PMU subset is then supplied to a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for
faulted-line localization and fault-type classification from time-series
measurements. Evaluation on modified IEEE 34- and IEEE 123-bus systems
demonstrates that the proposed FSNR-SVM method identifies a minimal PMU
configuration that achieves the best overall CNN performance, attaining over 96
percent accuracy in fault location and over 99 percent accuracy in fault-type
classification on the IEEE 34 system, and approximately 94 percent accuracy in
fault location and around 99.8 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on
the IEEE 123 system.

Abstract: This paper deals with the finite-time stabilization of a class of nonlinear
infinite-dimensional systems. First, we consider a bounded matched perturbation
in its linear form. It is shown that by using a set-valued function, both the
convergence objective (finite-time) and the rejection of perturbations are
achieved. Second, we consider a class of nonlinear systems and design a
feedback control that ensures the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. All
proofs presented in this paper regarding convergence are based on Lyapunov
theory. The existence of solutions to the closed-loop system and its
well-posedness are established using maximal monotone theory. To illustrate the
applicability of the theoretical results, a heat equation is considered as an
application of the main results.

Abstract: This paper presents the analysis, design, fabrication, and measurement of an
integrated low-noise amplifier (LNA) implemented using a 130 nm CMOS
technology, operating in the 2.4 GHz band. The LNA is a crucial component in
the performance of receivers, particularly in integrated receivers. The
proposed LNA was designed to meet the specifications of the IEEE 802.15.4
standard. Post-layout simulation results, including pads with electrostatic
discharge (ESD) protection, are as follows: gain of 10.7 dB, noise figure of
2.7 dB, third-order input intercept point (IIP3) of 0.9 dBm, input and output
impedance matching better than -20 dB with respect to 50~$\Omega$ terminations,
with a power consumption of 505 $\mu$W powered from a 1.2 V supply. The
obtained results fall within the range of those recently reported for the same
topology and operating frequency. The measured scattering parameters
(S-parameters) are consistent with the simulation results. This work
contributes to the development of a new research line in Cuba on the design of
radio-frequency (RF) integrated circuits.

Abstract: We present an AI-integrated molecular communication link validated on a
benchtop nanomachine testbed representative of subdermal implants. The system
employs an indium-gallium-zinc-oxide electrolyte-gated FET (IGZO-EGFET)
functionalized with glucose oxidase as a biocompatible receiver, a microfluidic
channel with a syringe-pump transmitter using on-off keying (OOK), and a
machine-intelligence pipeline that addresses model mismatch and hardware
non-idealities. The pipeline integrates: (i) a modular universal decoder robust
to vibration-induced noise, chemical delay, and single-tap intersymbol
interference; (ii) a lightweight pilot-only synchronizer that estimates symbol
intervals; and (iii) a virtual-response generator that augments data and scales
symbol duration. Experiments across multiple chips and sessions demonstrate
end-to-end chemical text transmission with consistent error-rate reductions
compared to naive thresholding and standard neural baselines. By coupling
biocompatible hardware with learning-based detection and generative
augmentation, this work establishes a practical route toward AI-native
nanomachine networks and higher rate molecular links, while providing a system
blueprint adaptable to other biochemical modalities.

Conclusion: 有载调压变压器和非线性负荷的相互作用可能导致电压不稳定，需要进一步研究以预防类似停电事件

Abstract: On 21 June 2024, a severe incident happened in the South-Eastern part of the
Continental European power system. After a voltage collapse, large parts of
Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Croatia suffered from a
blackout [1]. The initial tripping of two transmission lines resulted in a
voltage collapse in these countries. Investigations have shown that a)
transformers with on-load tap changers (OLTC) and b) nonlinear loads, in
particular air conditioning systems, played a significant role in this event.
Motivated by this, we carry out an assessment of the effect of OLTC on voltage
stability in the presence of nonlinear loads. By doing this we hope to further
shed some light on the potential instability mechanisms that can be triggered
in scenarios like the above-mentioned blackout.

Conclusion: 所提出的联合通信控制解决方案能够有效处理非线性控制非仿射动力学系统的稳定性问题，在6G环境中具有更好的性能和资源效率。

Abstract: Ensuring the stability of wireless networked control systems (WNCS) with
nonlinear and control-non-affine dynamics, where system behavior is nonlinear
with respect to both states and control decisions, poses a significant
challenge, particularly under limited resources. However, it is essential in
the context of 6G, which is expected to support reliable communication to
enable real-time autonomous systems. This paper proposes a joint communication
and control solution consisting of: i) a deep Koopman model capable of learning
and mapping complex nonlinear dynamics into linear representations in an
embedding space, predicting missing states, and planning control actions over a
future time horizon; and ii) a scheduling algorithm that schedules
sensor-controller communication based on Lyapunov optimization, which
dynamically allocates communication resources based on system stability and
available resources. Control actions are computed within this embedding space
using a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to ensure system stability. The
proposed model is evaluated under varying conditions and its performance is
compared against two baseline models; one that assumes systems are
control-affine, and another that assumes identical control actions in the
embedding and original spaces. The evaluation results demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms both baselines, by achieving stability while
requiring fewer transmissions.

Result: 通过案例研究验证了TREE在混合流量场景下暴露能源-服务不对称性的独特能力，而传统指标无法做到

Conclusion: TREE框架能够帮助网络运营商量化AI服务的运营能源成本，推动6G网络向可持续发展方向进化

Abstract: As wireless networks evolve toward AI-integrated intelligence, conventional
energy-efficiency metrics fail to capture the value of AI tasks. In this paper,
we propose a novel EE metric called Token-Responsive Energy Efficiency (TREE),
which incorporates the token throughput of large models as network utility
carriers into the system utility. Based on this metric, we analyze the design
principles of AI-integrated 6G networks from the perspective of three critical
AI elements, namely computing power, model and data. Case studies validate
TREE's unique capability to expose energy-service asymmetries in hybrid traffic
scenarios where conventional metrics prove inadequate. Although it is
impossible to determine every design detail of AI-integrated 6G network at
current time, we believe that the proposed TREE based framework will help the
network operators to quantify the operating energy cost of AI services and
continue to evolve towards sustainable 6G networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电气化道路的动态无线充电负载具有特定频率成分，可能激发电力系统频率动态，需要研究不同交通条件下DWPT负载的频谱特性

Method: 建立电动汽车以恒定速度行驶的统计模型，分析DWPT负载谐波的位置和幅度，使用交通模拟器进行数值验证

Result: 基频取决于线圈间距和平均车速；同步行驶时谐波幅度与车辆数量成正比，自由行驶时与平方根成正比；车队编队会加剧谐波；高阶谐波幅度减小但带宽增加

Conclusion: 尽管模型简化，但分析结果为电气化道路规划者和电网运营商提供了有价值的见解，数值测试验证了部分发现

Abstract: Electrified roadways (ER) equipped with dynamic wireless power transfer
(DWPT) capabilities can patently extend the driving range and reduce the
battery size of electric vehicles (EVs). However, due to the spatial
arrangement of the transmitter coils in the ER, the DWPT load exhibits
frequency content that could excite power system frequency dynamics. In this
context, this work aims to study the spectrum of DWPT loads under different
traffic conditions. We develop statistical models for EVs moving at constant
speeds to identify the location and magnitude of DWPT load harmonics. Our
analysis reveals that the fundamental frequency is dependent on the ER coil
spacing and the average EV speed. In the worst-case yet unlikely scenario that
EVs move in a synchronized fashion, the amplitude of harmonics scales with the
number of EVs. On the contrary, when EVs move freely, harmonics scale with the
square root of the number of EVs. Platoon formations can accentuate harmonics.
We also show that for higher-order harmonics, the spectral content around
harmonics decreases in magnitude and increases in bandwidth. Despite the
simplified models, our analysis offers valuable insights for ER planners and
grid operators. Numerical tests using a traffic simulator corroborate some of
these insights.
