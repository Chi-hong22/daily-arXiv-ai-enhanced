### [1] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的NeRF框架（PATA），通过动态时间步长策略在训练中平衡渲染质量与时间步长，从而在推理时减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF模型在训练和推理时依赖密集点采样，计算量大，限制了其在资源受限场景（如边缘计算）中的应用。脉冲神经网络（SNN）因其高效能特性成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出PATA框架，结合动态时间步长训练策略，自动优化渲染质量与时间步长的权衡，并在Instant-NGP架构上实现场景自适应推理。

Result: 实验表明，PATA在保持渲染质量的同时，减少推理时间步长64%和运行功耗61.55%。

Conclusion: PATA为NeRF模型在资源受限场景中的应用提供了高效解决方案，显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多关注解题能力，而本研究聚焦于评估学生解题过程、识别错误并依据固定标准评分。

Method: 收集了122份俄罗斯统一国家考试（EGE）的手写解题扫描件及官方评分，评估了七种现代视觉语言模型在三种推理模式下的表现。

Result: 结果显示当前模型在数学推理和评分标准对齐方面存在局限性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment
Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to
assess hand-written mathematical solutions. Unlike existing benchmarks that
focus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student
solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed
criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The
results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric
alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find

### [3] [Robust and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23006)
*Zhensheng Yuan,Haozhi Huang,Zhen Xiong,Di Wang,Guanghua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速重建和实时渲染城市规模场景的框架，通过并行训练和可控细节策略优化效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角捕获中外观变化对重建的影响，同时提升城市规模场景的重建和渲染效率。

Method: 采用场景分区并行训练、可见性图像选择、可控细节策略和外观变换模块，结合深度、尺度和抗锯齿增强模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和质量上优于先前方法，成功重建城市规模场景。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持高视觉保真度的同时，实现了高效的城市规模场景重建与渲染。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [4] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，生成多样且真实的人眼扫描路径，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型生成的平均行为无法捕捉人类视觉探索的变异性，ScanDiff旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用扩散模型的随机性和Vision Transformers，结合文本条件生成任务驱动的扫描路径。

Result: ScanDiff在自由观看和任务驱动场景中均优于现有方法，生成更多样且准确的扫描路径。

Conclusion: ScanDiff能更好地捕捉人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动视线预测研究。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [5] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了深度学习超分辨率技术在低质量超声心动图上的应用，显著提升了分类任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限环境下，低质量的超声心动图限制了诊断模型的效能，而超分辨率技术在此领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用SRGAN和SRResNet两种超分辨率模型对低质量图像进行增强，并在CAMUS数据集上评估了两种分类任务的表现。

Result: SRResNet在提升分类准确率方面表现显著，同时具有计算效率优势。

Conclusion: 超分辨率技术能有效恢复低质量超声心动图的诊断价值，为资源受限环境下的AI辅助医疗提供了可行工具。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive是一种单分支视觉语言架构，通过处理多模态输入（图像、地图、LiDAR和文本）实现实时自动驾驶，成功率和路径效率显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需在毫秒内处理复杂路况和交通意图，传统方法依赖循环内存，效率不足。

Method: 采用单分支架构，结合两阶段交叉注意力块对齐地图与路径点，并引入平滑损失避免突变控制。

Result: 在nuScenes/Waymo子集上，成功率提升4%，路径效率提升0.11，碰撞率降低1.4%。

Conclusion: NovaDrive通过多模态融合和轻量化设计，提升了自动驾驶的安全性和效率，并适用于其他具身AI领域。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种合成数据生成方法（MObI和AnydoorMed），分别用于自动驾驶和医学影像分析，通过扩散模型实现高真实性和可控性的多模态数据生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实数据采集成本高且复杂，合成数据方法在安全关键应用中变得重要，但需要高真实性和可控性。

Method: MObI通过3D边界框条件实现多模态对象修复，AnydoorMed则专注于医学影像的参考引导修复。

Result: 两种方法均能生成高度真实且可控的多模态数据，适用于自动驾驶和医学影像分析。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基础模型可轻松适应不同感知模态，为构建高度真实和可控的多模态反事实场景铺平道路。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一个结合视觉和语言的单一模型，通过融合摄像头、地图和路径点数据实现自动驾驶，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要几何精度和语义理解，但现有方法通常分开处理。XYZ-Drive旨在通过单一模型整合多模态数据，提升驾驶性能。

Method: 使用轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层融合摄像头帧、地图和路径点数据，部分微调LLaMA-3.2 11B模型。

Result: 在MD-NEX基准测试中，XYZ-Drive成功率达95%，SPL为0.80，优于PhysNav-DG 15%，碰撞率减半。

Conclusion: 早期多模态融合能实现准确、透明且实时的自动驾驶。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的方法E-FineR，用于细粒度图像分类，结合大语言模型和视觉语言模型，实现了开放集识别，并在零样本和少样本分类中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统细粒度图像分类方法依赖固定词汇和封闭集分类，难以适应新类别。现有方法未能充分利用大语言模型的能力，且依赖猜测的类别名称。

Method: 提出E-FineR方法，无需训练，结合大语言模型和视觉语言模型，增强分类阶段的解释性和灵活性。

Result: E-FineR在细粒度视觉识别中达到SOTA效果，并在零样本和少样本分类中表现优异，无需人工干预。

Conclusion: E-FineR推动了图像分类从固定标签预测向灵活语言驱动的理解转变，适用于实际场景和新领域。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合多种互补概念的两阶段开放词汇3D实例分割方法，通过改进的3D提案生成和分类策略，实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇3D实例分割方法中的概念互补但未充分结合，需设计统一方案以提升性能。

Method: 两阶段方案：3D提案生成（基于跟踪的聚合与迭代合并/移除）和实例分类（Alpha-CLIP与标准化最大相似度评分）。

Result: 在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上实现所有AP和AR指标的SOTA性能，甚至超过封闭词汇方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合互补概念并优化关键挑战，提出的方法显著提升了开放词汇3D实例分割的性能。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo是一种基于扩散的零样本肖像动画方法，通过驱动视频的面部动作生成静态肖像动画，解决了身份泄漏和表情捕捉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中身份泄漏和难以捕捉细微及极端表情的问题。

Method: 提出端到端训练框架，提取1D身份无关的运动描述符，通过交叉注意力控制生成过程，并结合双GAN解码器和数据增强。

Result: X-NeMo超越现有方法，生成高度表达且身份相似的动画。

Conclusion: X-NeMo通过创新的运动描述符和训练框架，显著提升了肖像动画的质量和身份保持能力。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种神经逆向渲染方法，从多视角图像中联合重建几何、反射率和光照条件，无需光学校准或中间线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要光学校准或中间线索（如法线图），限制了灵活性和准确性。

Method: 通过神经隐式场表示几何和反射率，结合阴影感知的体积渲染，联合优化所有场景参数。

Result: 在形状和光照估计精度上优于现有方法，适用于未对齐的多光源图像和复杂几何反射率物体。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需额外校准的情况下，实现了高精度的场景重建。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像修复网络，通过引入角点损失和残差卷积块注意力模块，有效去除单图像雨线，同时保留细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像雨线去除不仅需要抑制噪声，还需保留精细结构和视觉质量。

Method: 引入角点损失防止边界和纹理信息丢失，使用R-CBAM模块动态调整特征重要性。

Result: 在Rain100L和Rain100H数据集上PSNR分别达到33.29 dB和26.16 dB，优于之前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在去除雨线的同时，显著提升了图像质量。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏直观的用户交互模式，且未充分利用模态的序列表示。

Method: 采用序列级对比学习，首次引入音频模态，构建四模态联合嵌入空间。

Conclusion: 多模态运动检索框架在运动获取中具有显著潜力，四模态优于三模态。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有77个卫星图像基准测试中缺乏适合洪水区域分割的数据集，因此需要创建新数据集。

Method: 从Planet Labs收集2019年美国中西部洪水的卫星图像，每地10张图像，覆盖5个州，确保分辨率一致。测试了计算机视觉和遥感领域的最先进模型，并进行消融实验。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be
publicly available on

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的对抗攻击方法（AGD），通过将目标语义注入反向扩散的噪声中，欺骗多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）生成目标响应，同时保持原始图像的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击通常在高频段嵌入扰动，容易被低通滤波等防御方法抑制。AGD旨在通过全频谱噪声嵌入对抗信号，提高攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用对抗引导扩散（AGD）方法，将目标语义注入反向扩散的噪声中，利用扩散模型的全频谱特性，使对抗信号不易被抑制。

Result: 实验表明，AGD在攻击性能和防御鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGD通过噪声嵌入对抗信号，有效提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性，适用于多模态大语言模型的欺骗任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合分类和分割的模型，用于食品晶体团聚的自动检测，提高了准确性和尺寸分布预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品晶体团聚影响产品质量，但手动标注困难，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 先训练基线模型生成伪标签，再训练实例分类模型结合分割，最后通过后处理模块优化结果。

Result: 提高了团聚分类的准确性和尺寸分布预测，成功处理了不同置信度的手动标注。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了食品晶体团聚的检测问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在道路损伤检测中存在多尺度特征提取能力不足和计算资源需求高的问题，限制了实时检测的部署。

Method: 设计了双向多尺度空间金字塔池化模块（BMS-SPPF）增强多尺度特征提取，并采用分层通道压缩策略降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算资源需求，具有优秀的泛化能力。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义半监督少样本类增量学习（GSemi-FSCIL）框架，通过引入基类和所有已见过的新类作为未标记数据，更贴近实际场景。为解决新挑战，作者提出了一种基于模糊引导的可学习分布校准（ALDC）策略，动态利用基类样本校正新类特征分布。实验表明该方法优于现有工作。


<details>

Motivation: 现有半监督少样本类增量学习（Semi-FSCIL）假设未标记数据仅来自当前会话的新类，与实际场景不符。作者提出广义框架（GSemi-FSCIL），更贴近现实。

Method: 提出ALDC策略，动态利用基类样本校正新类特征分布，解决未标记数据来源混杂的问题。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实验，性能优于现有方法，达到新最优结果。

Conclusion: GSemi-FSCIL框架和ALDC策略有效解决了实际场景中的未标记数据混杂问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: RL-QR为RAG系统提供了一种可扩展、无需标注的查询优化方案，同时揭示了语义检索中的改进空间。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的时间序列评估指标TGSI和训练损失函数SATL，以更好地捕捉时间序列的几何结构，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值指标（如MSE）无法评估时间序列的几何结构，而几何结构对理解时间动态至关重要。

Method: 提出TGSI指标将时间序列转换为图像，并设计SATL损失函数，结合一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI指标上均优于基线方法，且推理时无额外计算成本。

Conclusion: TGSI和SATL有效提升了时间序列模型的几何结构建模能力。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用预设阈值生成伪标签，忽略了类别间分数分布的差异，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出SATL算法，动态计算每类正负样本的分数分布并学习类别特定阈值，同时引入差分排序损失以增强阈值区分度。

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和VG-200等大规模数据集上，SATL显著提升了有限标签场景下的性能。

Conclusion: SATL通过动态阈值学习和差分排序损失，有效解决了部分标签问题，提升了多标签图像识别的准确性。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散变换器的成功依赖于预训练VAE的压缩潜在空间，但两阶段训练会引入累积误差和解码伪影。现有方法转向像素空间但增加了复杂性。

Method: 提出PixelNerd，利用神经场表示直接建模补丁解码，避免了复杂的级联管道或VAE。

Conclusion: PixelNerd提供了一种高效、端到端的解决方案，显著提升了生成质量，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI的3D扫描手动分析耗时且主观，商业AI工具在低收入国家因成本高、软件专有和基础设施需求难以普及。

Method: 通过单一切片的边界框标注，采用三种切片追踪策略（从上到下、从下到上、中心向外）在3D体积中传播分割预测。

Result: 中心向外传播策略表现最一致和准确，SAM2在零样本条件下表现出色。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型如SAM2可在最小监督下支持3D医学图像分析，为资源有限地区提供可行方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法因全注意力机制导致计算成本过高，限制了多视图或高分辨率输入的可扩展性。

Method: iLRM采用迭代细化机制，解耦场景表示，使用两阶段注意力方案，并在每层注入高分辨率信息。

Result: 在RE10K和DL3DV数据集上，iLRM在重建质量和速度上均优于现有方法，且具有更高的可扩展性。

Conclusion: iLRM通过高效利用多视图输入，在计算成本相近的情况下实现了更高质量的重建。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RGB-D和深度学习的草莓质量估计方法，结合实例分割、遮挡修复和角度校正，实现了高精度的实时在线估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决田间草莓因遮挡和姿态变化导致的质量估计难题。

Method: 使用YOLOv8-Seg进行实例分割，CycleGAN修复遮挡区域，角度校正优化投影面积计算，多项式回归模型映射几何特征到质量。

Result: 平均质量估计误差为8.11%（无遮挡）和10.47%（有遮挡），CycleGAN在遮挡修复上优于LaMa模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂遮挡场景下的自动化收获和产量监测提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的功能，支持重建、生成和编辑，通过两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略保持原始理解性能，同时在生成和编辑任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP统一方法在重建和生成任务中需要额外解码器或量化，导致性能不一致或理解能力下降的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略，逐步将重建能力整合到CLIP中；提出双条件架构，连接MLLM和扩散变换器。

Result: 在生成任务中，UniLIP在GenEval和WISE基准上分别得分0.87和0.53；在编辑任务中，ImgEdit Benchmark得分3.62，超越现有模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的应用范围，使其在理解和生成/编辑任务中均表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个大规模抓取导向的affordance分割基准RAGNet，包含273k图像和26k推理指令，并提出了AffordanceNet框架，展示了强大的开放世界泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究缺乏基于推理的大规模affordance预测数据，限制了开放世界场景下的有效性。

Method: 构建RAGNet基准，包含多样化的图像和功能描述指令；提出AffordanceNet框架，结合预训练的VLM和抓取网络。

Result: 在affordance分割基准和真实机器人任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAGNet和AffordanceNet为开放世界抓取任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code
is available at https://github.com/wudongming97/AffordanceNet.

*Dohwan Ko,Ji Soo Lee,Minhyuk Choi,Zihang Meng,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BLiM框架和CPN模块，解决多模态大语言模型在文本-视频检索中的候选先验偏差问题，显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于候选似然的检索会引入候选先验偏差，导致高先验候选被优先选择，而非与查询更相关的候选。

Method: 提出BLiM框架，通过双向似然估计（文本生成视频和视频生成文本）和CPN模块（候选先验归一化）来缓解偏差。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，BLiM+CPN平均提升6.4 R@1，有效减轻偏差并增强查询-候选相关性。

Conclusion: BLiM和CPN不仅提升检索性能，还适用于其他多模态任务，减少对文本先验的依赖。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

TL;DR: 论文提出Layout Error Detection (LED)基准，用于评估文档布局预测的结构鲁棒性，并构建了合成数据集LED-Dataset。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文档布局分析技术有所进步，但仍存在区域合并、分割和内容缺失等结构错误，传统评估指标（如IoU和mAP）无法有效检测这些错误。

Method: 提出LED基准，定义八种标准化错误类型，并设计三种互补任务：错误存在检测、错误类型分类和元素级错误类型分类。构建合成数据集LED-Dataset。

Result: 实验表明，LED能有效区分结构理解能力，揭示传统指标无法发现的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED为文档布局分析提供了更全面的评估工具，有助于改进模型的结构鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解耦的图像几何编辑方法FreeFine，通过分离对象变换、源区域修复和目标区域细化，显著提升了编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的编辑方法在处理大或复杂变换时效果不佳，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用解耦流程，结合训练无关的扩散方法FreeFine，分别处理对象变换、源区域修复和目标区域细化。

Result: 在GeoBench基准测试中，FreeFine在图像保真度和编辑精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeFine为几何图像编辑提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-SAM是一种高效的半监督伪装目标检测框架，通过动态筛选高置信度伪标签和利用Segment Anything Model，仅需1%标注数据即可达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督伪装目标检测方法存在预测偏差、错误传播和高计算开销的问题，ST-SAM旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 采用自训练策略动态扩展高置信度伪标签，并利用Segment Anything Model的潜力，避免多网络架构。

Result: 在COD基准数据集上，ST-SAM仅用1%标注数据即超越现有方法，甚至媲美全监督方法。

Conclusion: ST-SAM为高效标注的半监督伪装目标检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶在无高清地图支持的复杂环境中需独立感知道路元素，现有方法对结构化先验利用不足，导致预测不规则、不准确。

Method: 结合实例感知注意力机制、数据驱动的形状模板空间和扩散框架，利用先验锚点生成准确预测。

Result: 在大规模自动驾驶数据集上验证，显著提升感知准确性，尤其在挑战性条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: PriorFusion框架通过整合多类先验，实现了更准确、规则且连贯的道路元素预测。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在生成艺术内容方面表现出色，但其内部如何表示内容和风格概念尚不明确，传统计算机视觉假设二者正交，但模型训练中未明确区分。

Method: 利用交叉注意力热图将生成图像的像素归因于特定提示词，从而分离内容和风格描述词影响的区域。

Result: 发现内容和风格词对图像区域的影响不同，内容词主要影响对象相关区域，风格词影响背景和纹理区域，表明模型对内容-风格区分有潜在理解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大规模生成模型如何在无明确监督下内部表示复杂艺术概念，并提供了代码、数据集和可视化工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Motivation: 现有视觉令牌剪枝方法在自动驾驶场景中表现不佳，而人类驾驶员主要关注前景信息，因此需要一种更有效的方法来保留关键信息。

Result: 在nuScenes闭环规划基准测试中，FastDriveVLA在不同剪枝比例下均取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA通过专注于前景信息的剪枝方法，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Result: 在OpenLane-V2基准测试中，车道段检测（mAP 37.4%）和中心线感知（OLS 46.3%）优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FASTopoWM通过时间传播和潜在世界模型显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Result: 在两个公开的多中心基准测试中，该框架显著优于现有领域泛化方法，实现了跨领域的鲁棒分割性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域偏移问题，为实际临床部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂城市环境中易受动态遮挡、静态障碍物和光照变化的影响，无法实现高质量道路重建。

Method: 采用平面适应的高斯表示进行高效建模，结合语义引导的视频修复去除动态和静态前景物体，并通过语义感知的HSV空间颜色校正增强一致性。

Result: 在城市规模数据集上验证，该方法在视觉一致性和几何准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实复杂环境中实现了高质量的道路表面重建。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Motivation: 人脸检测在AI应用中至关重要，但低分辨率图像会降低检测性能，需研究分辨率对模型的影响。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，评估YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN在多种分辨率下的性能指标（如精度、召回率、mAP等）。

Result: YOLOv11在高分辨率下准确率最高，YOLOv12召回率略优，MTCNN速度较慢但地标定位表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究结果为不同操作约束下选择分辨率敏感的人脸检测模型提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Result: 提出的客观评估方法在AGTH质量评估中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: THQA-10K数据集和提出的方法为AGTH质量评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Motivation: 探讨计算机视觉领域的关键设计模式及其演变，从基础架构到生成模型和自监督学习技术。

Method: 通过分析六篇论文，总结其核心方法：ResNet的残差连接、ViT的注意力机制、GANs的对抗训练、LDMs的潜在空间去噪、DINO的自蒸馏框架和MAE的掩码自编码器。

Result: ResNet解决了梯度消失问题；ViT展示了注意力模型的有效性；GANs和LDMs在生成任务中表现优异；DINO和MAE在自监督学习中取得显著成果。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉设计模式从基础架构发展到生成和自监督学习，技术不断演进，性能显著提升。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解和推理方面表现出色，但其庞大的参数和高计算成本限制了实际应用。现有NLP层剪枝方法在LVLM中效果不佳，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: 通过分析非必要的视觉语言（VL）标记和层间特征差异，提出了Short-LVLM框架，利用重要VL标记并减少层间特征差异。

Result: Short-LVLM在性能和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，同时具备无需训练、模型无关和高兼容性等优势。

Conclusion: Short-LVLM为LVLM的层剪枝提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

Conclusion: VMatcher通过混合Mamba和Transformer，实现了高效且强大的特征匹配，适用于实时场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Conclusion: UniEmo通过统一框架和双重反馈机制，成功提升了情感理解与生成的性能。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在利用CLIP生成伪标签时，一次性对齐所有样本容易受到噪声和难分类样本的影响，导致错误传播和特征学习不理想，尤其在多源场景下问题更严重。

Method: 提出渐进式对齐策略MP^2A，先在高置信度目标样本上训练模型，逐步引入更具挑战性的样本，以减少初始噪声的影响。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet三个基准测试中，MP^2A表现优于现有基于CLIP的多源无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: MP^2A通过渐进式对齐策略有效减少了噪声干扰，提升了模型对域不变特征的学习能力，在多源无监督域适应任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: NeRF与3DGS互补，为高效3D场景表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为自适应分组对齐（AGA）的新框架，用于从医学图像和报告中学习结构化语义，解决了现有方法忽略报告结构和依赖大量负样本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学领域的视觉语言预训练方法常简化临床报告为单一实体或碎片化标记，且对比学习框架依赖大量负样本，这在小型医学数据集中不实用。

Method: AGA通过双向分组机制和稀疏相似性矩阵，动态学习分组阈值，并引入实例感知组对齐损失和双向跨模态分组对齐模块，实现细粒度对齐。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，AGA在图像文本检索和分类任务中表现出色，适用于微调和零样本设置。

Conclusion: AGA通过结构化语义学习和自适应分组对齐，显著提升了医学视觉表示的性能，无需依赖外部负样本。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 解决现有生成方法在计算成本、可靠性和适应性上的不足，特别是在医学影像中低发病率病理案例的检测。

Method: 利用SBDDM的前向扩散轨迹，通过Stein分数捕捉轨迹曲率，仅需五步扩散即可实现异常评分。

Result: 在Near-OOD和Far-OOD检测中分别实现了10.43%和18.10%的相对提升，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: SBDDM是一种高效、可靠的OOD检测方法，适用于实时计算机辅助诊断。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该系统是化学检测方法的有效替代方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Motivation: 艺术风格分类因缺乏专家标注数据和风格元素的复杂非线性交互而具有挑战性。现有双教师自监督框架的线性投影层和局部关注难以建模全局构图和复杂风格特征交互。

Method: 改进双教师知识蒸馏框架，用KANs替代传统MLP投影和预测头，利用其基于样条的激活函数精确建模非线性特征相关性。

Result: 在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Top-1准确率上优于基础双教师架构，且KANs在解耦复杂风格流形上表现更优。

Conclusion: KANs在建模非线性特征交互和提升线性探测准确率方面具有显著优势，为艺术风格分类提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是利用机器学习技术解决医学影像分析中的复杂问题，提高疾病预测的准确性。

Method: 方法包括使用5824张胸部X光片，分别训练基线CNN和DenseNet-121模型，并进行性能比较。

Result: 结果显示，两种模型在二元分类任务中表现良好，但DenseNet-121在决策时更准确地关注关键区域。

Conclusion: 结论是DenseNet-121在医学影像分析中具有更高的潜力，尤其是在关注关键特征方面优于基线CNN。

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决联邦学习中分辨率漂移问题的方法（RAF），通过热图知识蒸馏提升分辨率鲁棒性，适用于非分类任务如人体姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在分类任务中表现良好，但在非分类任务（如人体姿态估计）中因分辨率漂移问题性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出分辨率自适应联邦学习（RAF），利用热图知识蒸馏，通过多分辨率知识蒸馏（高分辨率输出作为教师，低分辨率输出作为学生）增强分辨率鲁棒性。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，RAF有效缓解分辨率漂移，显著提升性能，并可无缝集成到现有联邦学习框架中。

Conclusion: RAF不仅适用于人体姿态估计，其方法还可能推广到其他依赖空间细节的任务。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CST Anti-UAV数据集，针对复杂场景下小型无人机的单目标跟踪任务，填补了现有数据集的不足，并评估了20种现有方法，发现性能仍有提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪数据集在场景复杂性和目标多样性上不足，限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了CST Anti-UAV数据集，包含220个视频序列和24万高质量标注框，特别关注小型无人机目标和复杂场景。

Result: 现有最佳方法在CST Anti-UAV数据集上的准确率仅为35.92%，远低于其他数据集的表现。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV数据集的发布将推动更鲁棒的单目标跟踪方法和反无人机系统的创新。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉语言模型在推理和泛化能力上存在不足，主要由于高质量空间数据的缺乏和静态视角假设的限制。

Method: 构建Scene-30K合成数据集，结合RLHF策略（如GRPO）和三种奖励函数，并引入动态视角选择策略。

Result: 在多个3D场景基准测试中平均提升10%。

Conclusion: 3D-R1显著提升了3D场景理解的推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Result: 模型在定位任务上达到93.63%的准确率，异常检测任务上达到87.48%的准确率，仅需100万参数。

Conclusion: 该多任务模型优于现有单任务模型，为AI在胶囊内窥镜中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，使用该方法生成的3D模拟数据显著提升了真实任务的性能，并与真实数据高度相似。

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real为3D数据模拟提供了新路径，验证了其高效性和实用性。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Motivation: 现有基于欧几里得空间的配准方法难以有效处理跨模态图像的对齐问题，导致配准和融合质量不佳。

Method: 提出Hy-CycleAlign方法，采用双路径循环配准框架（前向配准网络和后向配准网络）和H$^{2}$CA模块，将图像映射到双曲空间并施加配准约束。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多模态图像配准和融合上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双曲空间为多模态图像配准提供了更敏感和有效的解决方案，Hy-CycleAlign具有显著优势。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 最小充分像素集是理解模型决策过程的有效工具，不同架构模型在集中度上存在差异。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Result: ART在多个数据集上显著优于基线，并能推断未见过的关系概念。

Conclusion: ART为VRD任务提供了更通用的解决方案，并展示了在复杂场景分割中的实用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Conclusion: GSFFs方法在视觉定位任务中实现了高精度和隐私保护，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss框架有效解决了手语翻译的挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib在V2X场景中实现了高效、稳定的自动校准，为基础设施摄像头的大规模校准提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向性纯2D方法的高效3D占用预测方法，平衡了精度与推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要高效且高精度的3D占用预测，但现有方法常牺牲实时性。

Method: 通过切片3D体素特征保留垂直几何信息，结合方向性注意力机制提取几何特征。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes上达到39.3% mIoU和27.7 FPS，边缘设备上14.8 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度与效率间取得平衡，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时空频率运动感知的视觉伪装Mamba（Vcamba），通过整合频率和空间特征，提高了视频伪装目标检测的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间外观特征，但由于前景与背景高度相似，空间特征的区分性有限，影响了检测效果。频率特征和Mamba模型的能力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 设计了多个模块：RFVSS用于多尺度空间特征提取，AFE用于频率学习，SLMP和FLMP分别建模时空和频率-时间序列，SFMF整合双域特征。

Result: 在2个数据集上的6项评估指标中表现优于现有方法，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Vcamba通过整合频率和空间特征，显著提升了视频伪装目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保医疗图像共享时符合患者隐私法律，同时保留非PHI元数据以支持AI研究。

Method: 挑战赛分为训练、验证和测试三个阶段，使用包含合成PHI/PII的真实DICOM图像，参与者使用多种工具和方法。

Result: 十支团队完成测试，正确行动百分比得分在97.91%至99.93%之间。

Conclusion: MIDI-B挑战赛为图像去标识化提供了标准化平台，展示了规则方法的有效性，并总结了经验和教训。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

TL;DR: DivControl提出了一种可分解的预训练框架，通过SVD分解ControlNet为基本组件，实现统一可控生成和高效适应，显著降低训练成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像到图像生成中，要么为每个条件训练单独模型，要么使用纠缠表示的统一架构，导致泛化能力差且适应新条件成本高。

Method: DivControl通过SVD分解ControlNet为基本组件，利用知识转移和动态门实现条件无关和条件特定的解耦，并通过表示对齐损失提升条件保真度。

Result: DivControl在可控性上达到SOTA，训练成本降低36.4倍，同时在基础条件和未见条件上表现出色。

Conclusion: DivControl展示了卓越的可扩展性、模块化和迁移能力，为可控生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative
porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's
effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal

Method: EMAT引入内存高效的掩码注意力机制、可学习下采样策略和参数效率增强。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上表现优于现有方法，参数更少。

Conclusion: EMAT提升了小物体处理能力，并提出了更实用的评估设置。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了计算复杂度和内存访问需求，为SNN的高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and

generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves

Conclusion: 显式条件化时间元数据是解决时间动态迁移问题的有效方法，OmniTraj展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Result: 在对象发现和识别等任务上达到SOTA，并提升视觉预测和推理能力。

Conclusion: DIAS有效解决了槽冗余和内部监督不足的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的方法仅支持单对象、单步交互，无法满足复杂现实场景中的长时程、多对象任务需求。

Method: 提出SeqSplatNet框架，结合大语言模型和条件解码器，生成3D功能掩码序列；引入预训练策略和特征注入机制以处理复杂几何和语义模糊。

Conclusion: SeqSplatNet有效解决了长时程功能推理问题，为复杂3D场景中的智能体交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Motivation: 现有3D人体模型（如SMPL-X）缺乏物理交互能力，导致穿透和不真实的动态问题。

Method: 采用“半物理”机制，将运动学动作转化为物理模拟，保持运动学控制的同时实现物理交互。

Result: 方法无需学习，实时运行，适用于任意体型和动作，且保持原始动作的保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D人体模型的物理交互问题，具有通用性和实时性。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Motivation: 当前端到端grounding模型在复杂基准测试中准确率不足65%，远未达到部署要求，需改进。

Method: 通过实证研究，从数据收集到模型训练优化细节，开发了Phi-Ground模型家族。

Result: Phi-Ground在5个基准测试中表现最佳，端到端模型在ScreenSpot-pro和UI-Vision上分别达到43.2和27.2分。

Conclusion: 研究不仅改进了grounding模型，还为其他感知任务提供了借鉴。

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要密集多视角（如数百个校准摄像头），成本高且难以捕捉野外多样化场景。本文旨在从少量稀疏视角（如四个静态摄像头）重建动态行为（如修车或跳舞）。

Method: 通过独立单目重建的精心对齐，生成时间和视角一致的动态场景重建。

Result: 在PanopticStudio和Ego-Exo4D上的实验表明，该方法在渲染新视角时优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视角下实现了高质量动态场景重建，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上训练，生成质量优于现有方法，且对野外视频输入表现出色。

Conclusion: 为高质量动态3D内容生成提供了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

Conclusion: 多视图自监督学习框架成功结合对比和重建目标，为音乐音频表示的解耦提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) methods offer a range of
strategies for capturing useful representations from music audio without the
need for labeled data. While some techniques focus on preserving comprehensive
details through reconstruction, others favor semantic structure via contrastive
objectives. Few works examine the interaction between these paradigms in a
unified SSL framework. In this work, we propose a multi-view SSL framework for
disentangling music audio representations that combines contrastive and
reconstructive objectives. The architecture is designed to promote both
information fidelity and structured semantics of factors in disentangled
subspaces. We perform an extensive evaluation on the design choices of
contrastive strategies using music audio representations in a controlled
setting. We find that while reconstruction and contrastive strategies exhibit
consistent trade-offs, when combined effectively, they complement each other;
this enables the disentanglement of music attributes without compromising
information integrity.

Conclusion: PancreasDG为医学影像域泛化设新基准，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key

Abstract: Age-structured models represent the dynamic behaviors of populations over
time and result in integro-partial differential equations (IPDEs). Such
processes arise in biotechnology, economics, demography, and other domains.
Coupled age-structured IPDE population dynamics with two or more species occur
in epidemiology and ecology, but have received little attention thus far. This
work considers an exponentially unstable model of two competing predator
populations, formally referred to in the literature as ''competition''
dynamics. If one were to apply an input that simultaneously harvests both
predator species, one would have control over only the product of the densities
of the species, not over their ratio. Therefore, it is necessary to design a
control input that directly harvests only one of the two predator species,
while indirectly influencing the other via a backstepping approach. The model
is transformed into a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations
(ODEs), of which only one is actuated, and two autonomous, exponentially stable
integral delay equations (IDEs) which enter the ODEs as nonlinear disturbances.
The ODEs are globally stabilized with backstepping and an estimate of the
region of attraction of the asymptotically stabilized equilibrium of the full
IPDE system is provided, under a positivity restriction on control. These
generalizations open exciting possibilities for future research directions,
such as investigating population systems with more than two species.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a tangible platform for demonstrating
the practical implementation of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC)
systems, an enhancement to the standard adaptive cruise control (ACC) concept
by means of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. It involves a detailed
examination of existing longitudinal controllers and their performance in
homogeneous vehicle platoons. Moreover, extensive tests are conducted using
multiple autonomous experimental vehicle platform topologies to verify the
effectiveness of the controller. The outcomes from both simulations and field
tests affirm the substantial benefits of the proposed CACC platooning approach
in longitudinal vehicle platooning scenarios. This research is crucial due to a
notable gap in the existing literature; while numerous studies focus on
simulated vehicle platooning systems, there is lack of research demonstrating
these controllers on physical vehicle systems or robot platforms. This paper
seeks to fill this gap by providing a practical demonstration of CACC systems
in action, showcasing their potential for real-world application in intelligent
transportation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust control synthesis and analysis framework for
nonlinear systems with uncertain initial conditions. First, a deep
learning-based lifting approach is proposed to approximate nonlinear dynamical
systems with linear parameter-varying (LPV) state-space models in
higher-dimensional spaces while simultaneously characterizing the uncertain
initial states within the lifted state space. Then, convex synthesis conditions
are provided to generate full-state feedback nonstationary LPV (NSLPV)
controllers for the lifted LPV system. A performance measure similar to the
l2-induced norm is used to provide robust performance guarantees in the
presence of exogenous disturbances and uncertain initial conditions. The paper
also includes results for synthesizing full-state feedback LTI controllers and
output feedback NSLPV controllers. Additionally, a robustness analysis approach
based on integral quadratic constraint (IQC) theory is developed to analyze and
tune the synthesized controllers while accounting for noise associated with
state measurements. This analysis approach characterizes model parameters and
disturbance inputs using IQCs to reduce conservatism. Finally, the
effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through two
illustrative examples.

Abstract: As global energy systems transit to clean energy, accurate renewable
generation and renewable demand forecasting is imperative for effective grid
management. Foundation Models (FMs) can help improve forecasting of renewable
generation and demand because FMs can rapidly process complex, high-dimensional
time-series data. This review paper focuses on FMs in the realm of renewable
energy forecasting, primarily focusing on wind and solar. We present an
overview of the architectures, pretraining strategies, finetuning methods, and
types of data used in the context of renewable energy forecasting. We emphasize
the role of models that are trained at a large scale, domain specific
Transformer architectures, where attention is paid to spatial temporal
correlations, the embedding of domain knowledge, and also the brief and
intermittent nature of renewable generation. We assess recent FM based
advancements in forecast accuracy such as reconciling predictions over multiple
time scales and quantifying uncertainty in renewable energy forecasting. We
also review existing challenges and areas of improvement in long-term and
multivariate time series forecasting. In this survey, a distinction between
theory and practice is established regarding the use of FMs in the clean energy
forecasting domain. Additionally, it critically assesses the strengths and
weaknesses of FMs while advancing future research direction in this new and
exciting area of forecasting.

Abstract: This work establishes a crucial step toward advancing data-driven
trajectory-based methods for stochastic systems with unknown mathematical
dynamics. In contrast to scenario-based approaches that rely on independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) trajectories, this work develops a data-driven
framework where each trajectory is gathered over a finite horizon and exhibits
temporal dependence-referred to as a non-i.i.d. trajectory. To ensure safety of
dynamical systems using such trajectories, the current body of literature
primarily considers dynamics subject to unknown-but-bounded disturbances, which
facilitates robust analysis. While promising, such bounds may be violated in
practice and the resulting worst-case robust analysis tends to be overly
conservative. To overcome these fundamental challenges, this paper considers
stochastic systems with unknown mathematical dynamics, influenced by process
noise with unknown distributions. In the proposed framework, data is collected
from stochastic systems under multiple realizations within a finite-horizon
experiment, where each realization generates a non-i.i.d. trajectory.
Leveraging the concept of stochastic control barrier certificates constructed
from data, this work quantifies probabilistic safety guarantees with a
certified confidence level. To achieve this, the proposed conditions are
formulated as sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization problems, relying solely on
empirical average of the collected trajectories and statistical features of the
process noise. The efficacy of the approach has been validated on three
stochastic benchmarks with both unknown models and noise distributions. In one
case study, it is shown that while no safety controller exists for the robust
analysis of the system under bounded disturbances, the proposed stochastic
framework offers a safety controller with guaranteed probabilistic
satisfaction.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于人类理由的监督框架，帮助自动驾驶车辆（AVs）在动态驾驶环境中更有效地应对伦理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注极端伦理问题（如电车难题），而忽略了日常驾驶中的伦理困境。AVs通常严格遵循交通规则，而人类驾驶员会根据实际情况灵活调整。

Method: 引入了一种人类理由监督框架，检测AV行为是否与人类理由一致，触发轨迹重新规划，结合运动规划与控制系统实现实时调整。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架能促使AVs在轨迹与人类理由不符时重新规划，更好地兼顾安全、效率和法规。

Conclusion: 该框架为AVs提供了更灵活、以人为中心的决策路径。

Abstract: Ethical dilemmas are a common challenge in everyday driving, requiring human
drivers to balance competing priorities such as safety, efficiency, and rule
compliance. However, much of the existing research in automated vehicles (AVs)
has focused on high-stakes "trolley problems," which involve extreme and rare
situations. Such scenarios, though rich in ethical implications, are rarely
applicable in real-world AV decision-making. In practice, when AVs confront
everyday ethical dilemmas, they often appear to prioritise strict adherence to
traffic rules. By contrast, human drivers may bend the rules in
context-specific situations, using judgement informed by practical concerns
such as safety and efficiency. According to the concept of meaningful human
control, AVs should respond to human reasons, including those of drivers,
vulnerable road users, and policymakers. This work introduces a novel human
reasons-based supervision framework that detects when AV behaviour misaligns
with expected human reasons to trigger trajectory reconsideration. The
framework integrates with motion planning and control systems to support
real-time adaptation, enabling decisions that better reflect safety,
efficiency, and regulatory considerations. Simulation results demonstrate that
this approach could help AVs respond more effectively to ethical challenges in
dynamic driving environments by prompting replanning when the current
trajectory fails to align with human reasons. These findings suggest that our
approach offers a path toward more adaptable, human-centered decision-making in
AVs.

Abstract: Distribution grid operation faces new challenges caused by a rising share of
renewable energy sources and the introduction of additional types of loads to
the grid. With the increasing adoption of distributed generation and emerging
prosumer households, Energy Management Systems, which manage and apply
flexibility of connected devices, are gaining popularity. While potentially
beneficial to grid capacity, strategic energy management also adds to the
complexity of distribution grid operation and planning processes. Novel
approaches of time-series-based planning likewise face increasingly complex
simulation scenarios and rising computational cost. Discrete event modelling
helps facilitating simulations of such scenarios by restraining computation to
the most relevant points in simulation time. We provide an enhancement of a
discrete event distribution grid simulation software that offers fast
implementation and testing of energy management algorithms, embedded into a
feature-rich simulation environment. Physical models are specified using the
Discrete Event System Specification. Furthermore, we contribute a communication
protocol that makes use of the discrete event paradigm by only computing
flexibility potential when necessary.

Conclusion: 更新的SLP和傅里叶级数模型能更准确地反映当前电力消费行为，为能源系统规划和运营提供更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Estimating electricity consumption accurately is essential for the planning
and operation of energy systems, as well as for billing processes. Standard
Load Profiles (SLP) are widely used to estimate consumption patterns of
different user groups. However, in Germany these SLP were formulated using
historical data from over 20 years ago and have not been adjusted since.
Changing electricity consumption behaviour, which leads to increasing
deviations between load patterns and SLP, results in a need for a revision
taking into account new data. The growing number of smart meters provides a
large measurement database, which enables more accurate load modelling. This
paper creates updated SLP using recent data. In addition, the assumptions of
the SLP method are validated and improvements are proposed, taking into account
the ease of applicability. Furthermore, a Fourier Series-based model is
proposed as an alternative SLP model. The different models are compared and
evaluated.

Abstract: Achieving safety in autonomous multi-agent systems, particularly in
time-critical tasks like rendezvous, is a critical challenge. In this paper, we
propose a distributionally robust risk framework for analyzing cascading
failures in multi-agent rendezvous. To capture the complex interactions between
network connectivity, system dynamics, and communication delays, we use a
time-delayed network model as a benchmark. We introduce a conditional
distributionally robust functional to quantify cascading effects between
agents, utilizing a bi-variate normal distribution. Our approach yields
closed-form risk expressions that reveal the impact of time delay, noise
statistics, communication topology, and failure modes on rendezvous risk. The
insights derived inform the design of resilient networks that mitigate the risk
of cascading failures. We validate our theoretical results through extensive
simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: This paper presents an integration study for a power electronic-based
fast-frequency response technology, an asynchronous grid connection operating
as an aggregator for behindthe-meter resources and distributed generators. Both
technical feasibility and techno-economic viability studies are presented. The
dynamic performance of the fast-frequency response enabled by the asynchronous
grid connection is validated with Power Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments and
transferred to an IEEE 9-bus system in DigSilent PowerFactory for dynamic
stability analysis. We demonstrate that droop-based control enhancements to the
local distributed generators could allow their aggregation to provide
grid-supporting functionalities and participate in the market for ancillary
services. To this end, we performed a long-term simulation embedding the system
within the ancillary service market framework of PJM. The fast-frequency
response regulation is subsequently used to calculate the potential revenue and
project the results on a 15-year investment horizon. Finally, the
techno-economic analysis concludes with recommendations for enhancements to

Conclusion: 提出的方法首次实现了LPV模型的联合降维，为复杂系统控制提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) framework is a powerful tool for
controlling nonlinear and complex systems, but the conversion of nonlinear
models into LPV forms often results in high-dimensional and overly conservative
LPV models. To be able to apply control strategies, there is often a need for
model reduction in order to reduce computational needs. This paper presents the
first systematic approach for the joint reduction of state order and scheduling
signal dimension of LPV state space models. The existing methods typically
address these reductions separately. By formulating a tensorial form of LPV
models with an affine dependency on the scheduling variables, we leverage
tensor decomposition to find the dominant components of state and scheduling
subspaces. We extend the common Petrov-Galerkin projection approach to LPV
framework by adding a scheduling projection. This extension enables the joint
reduction. To find suitable subspaces for the extended Petrov-Galerkin
projection, we have developed two different methods: tensor-based LPV moment
matching, and an approach through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Advantages
of the proposed methods are demonstrated on two different series-interconnected
mass-spring-damper systems with nonlinear springs: one primarily used for
comparison with other methods and a more elaborate higher-order model designed
to assess scalability.

Method: 系统比较了四种对话配置：LLM对、LLM三人组、人类三人组和混合人类-LLM对，分析对话前后的准确性变化。

Result: 人类参与的对话显著提升准确性，而纯LLM对话导致准确性下降，知识多样性是协同效应的关键。

Conclusion: AI开发应注重代理间的知识多样性，而非仅优化单个模型的独立性能，以提升群体协作效果。

Abstract: Conversations transform individual knowledge into collective insight,
allowing groups of humans and increasingly groups of artificial intelligence
(AI) agents to collaboratively solve complex problems. Whether interactions
between AI agents can replicate the synergy observed in human discussions
remains an open question. To investigate this, we systematically compared four
conversational configurations: pairs of large language models (LLM-LLM), trios
of LLMs, trios of humans, and mixed human-LLM pairs. After agents answered
questions individually, they engaged in open-ended discussions and then
reconsidered their initial answers. Interactions involving humans consistently
led to accuracy improvements after the conversations, benefiting both stronger
and weaker participants. By contrast, purely LLM-based pairs and trios
exhibited declines in accuracy, demonstrating limited conversational synergy.
Analysis of participants' confidence and answer-switching behavior revealed
that knowledge diversity is a critical factor enabling collaborative
improvement. Crucially, the lack of gains in LLM-LLM interactions did not stem
from a fundamental limitation of the models' ability to collaborate, but from
highly similar knowledge states that left little room for productive exchange.
Our findings argue for a paradigm shift in AI development: rather than
optimizing individual models solely for standalone performance, explicitly
cultivating diversity across agents, even at the cost of slightly lower
individual accuracy, may yield AI collaborators that are more effective in
group settings with humans or other AI systems.

Abstract: Information Visualization has been utilized to gain insights from complex
data. In recent times, Large Language models (LLMs) have performed very well in
many tasks. In this paper, we showcase the capabilities of different popular
LLMs to generate code for visualization based on simple prompts. We also
analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering
questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some simpler
visualizations such as bar and pie charts. Moreover, they could answer simple
questions about visualizations. However, LLMs also have several limitations.
For example, some of them had difficulty generating complex visualizations,
such as violin plot. LLMs also made errors in answering some questions about
visualizations, for example, identifying relationships between close boundaries
and determining lengths of shapes. We believe that our insights can be used to
improve both LLMs and Information Visualization systems.

adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic
and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%
of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not
supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI
performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;
the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this
first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong
diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI
performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.
These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical
decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare
workforce shortages.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合EEG和LLM的混合框架，用于实时适应语言康复需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AAC系统和语言学习平台无法实时适应用户认知和语言需求，尤其在神经系统疾病中。

Method: 利用实时EEG信号驱动LLM语言康复助手，支持心理命令导航、动态个性化学习和认知努力监测。

Result: 系统能帮助严重语言或运动障碍用户进行语言学习，并动态调整任务难度。

Conclusion: 该框架为语言康复提供了实时适应性和个性化支持的新方法。

Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and
language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's
cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as
post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary
strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs
generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a
novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an
LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable
users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning
modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary,
sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor
neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.

TL;DR: Accessibility Scout是一个基于LLM的系统，通过照片评估建筑环境的无障碍性，结合用户个性化需求，实现可扩展且个性化的无障碍评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动评估方法耗时且难以扩展，而自动化方法常忽视用户个性化需求。LLM的进步为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 开发Accessibility Scout系统，结合LLM和用户输入，生成个性化无障碍评估。通过三项研究验证其有效性。

Result: 技术评估和用户研究表明，系统能生成超越传统ADA考量的个性化无障碍扫描。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更可扩展和个性化的物理世界无障碍评估提供了方向。

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for
people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or
their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while
automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique
needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches
to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more
adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present
Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies
accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use,
Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout",
tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences,
and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI
assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six
participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical
evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10
participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and
user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized
accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally,
we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps
for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the
physical world.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实时预测点头时机和类型的模型，基于语音活动预测（VAP）模型，并结合多任务学习和预训练，显著提升了点头预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对话中，非语言信息（如点头）与语言信息同等重要，现有系统需要改进以实时预测点头行为。

Method: 扩展VAP模型，结合多任务学习和预训练，实现连续实时的点头预测。

Result: 多任务学习显著提升预测效果，降低处理速率不影响准确性，主观评估优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 模型在实时性和准确性上表现优异，适用于专注倾听系统。

Abstract: In human dialogue, nonverbal information such as nodding and facial
expressions is as crucial as verbal information, and spoken dialogue systems
are also expected to express such nonverbal behaviors. We focus on nodding,
which is critical in an attentive listening system, and propose a model that
predicts both its timing and type in real time. The proposed model builds on
the voice activity projection (VAP) model, which predicts voice activity from
both listener and speaker audio. We extend it to prediction of various types of
nodding in a continuous and real-time manner unlike conventional models. In
addition, the proposed model incorporates multi-task learning with verbal
backchannel prediction and pretraining on general dialogue data. In the timing
and type prediction task, the effectiveness of multi-task learning was
significantly demonstrated. We confirmed that reducing the processing rate
enables real-time operation without a substantial drop in accuracy, and
integrated the model into an avatar attentive listening system. Subjective
evaluations showed that it outperformed the conventional method, which always
does nodding in sync with verbal backchannel. The code and trained models are
available at https://github.com/MaAI-Kyoto/MaAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人机交互研究忽视了AI系统如何潜意识地重塑人类认知，CIS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过叙事场景分析个体、集体和社会层面的影响，并提出“基础设施崩溃方法”揭示算法影响。

Result: CIS揭示了AI预处理如何重塑分布式认知，并整合多学科方法填补研究空白。

Conclusion: CIS为理解AI对人类认知的深层影响提供了新框架，并提出了方法论创新。

Abstract: Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems
fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot
for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces "Cognitive
Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to
reconceptualize AI as "cognitive infrastructures": foundational, often
invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital
societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through
anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their
influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate "relevance judgment,"
shifting the "locus of epistemic agency" to non-human systems. Through
narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective
(democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how
cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social
epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed
cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring
unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also
addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks
population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot
access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss
cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides
methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence:
"infrastructure breakdown methodologies", experimental approaches that reveal
cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after
periods of habituation.

Method: 方法基于作者主持的“如何在AI生态系统中思考公平”研讨会的经验，涵盖从策划到执行的完整过程。

Result: 尽管面临低参与率等困难，研讨会促成了多元群体的深入讨论，并成功吸引一名参与者转为共同主持人。

Conclusion: 结论强调将失败视为学习机会，为跨学科研究者提供了实用策略，并推动了参与式工作的实践讨论。

Abstract: This reflective paper explores often-unspoken challenges of designing and
facilitating co-design and participatory workshops, offering practical
strategies for early career researchers (ECRs) navigating these methods.
Drawing from personal experience conducting a series of workshops titled: How
to Think About Equity in the AI Ecosystem. It follows the full arc of the
workshop experience, from conceptualization and activity planning to
participant recruitment and facilitation, offering a grounded account of what
happens when participation does not go as expected. The paper examines the
methodological challenges of engaging non-expert participants, particularly
when operating without institutional support, financial incentives, or
integration into larger events. Despite initial difficulties such as low
attendance, the workshop fostered rich discussions among a demographically
diverse group and ultimately led to one participant volunteering to
co-facilitate a subsequent session. This transition from participant to
co-facilitator exemplifies the redistribution of epistemic authority,
positioning lived experience as central to research and engagement practices.
By reframing perceived failure as a productive site of learning, the paper
offers practical strategies for ECRs working across disciplines who often
navigate unfamiliar methodological terrains, contributing to broader
conversations on the realities of doing interdisciplinary, participatory work
in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于脑-肌肉接口（BMuI）的新型运动意图提取框架，以解决传统运动想象BCI中标签不精确的问题，并通过EMG作为高保真中继介质提高意图识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动想象BCI在真实场景中因EEG信号与行为意图不匹配导致伪标签问题，影响解码精度和系统鲁棒性。

Method: 提出BMuI框架，模拟大脑到肌肉的神经通路，利用EMG作为中继介质，并通过离线和在线实验验证其可行性。

Result: BMuI可行，预测准确率为0.8314；在线实验中所有参与者成功控制Unity虚拟手臂。

Conclusion: BMuI框架有效解决了运动意图识别中的伪标签问题，提升了BCI系统的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable real-time interaction between the
brain and external devices by decoding neural signals. However, existing
motor-based BCI paradigms, like motor imagery BCI, face challenges with
imprecise labeling in real-world use. This mismatch between EEG signals and
true behavioral intentions leads to pseudo-labels, undermining decoding
accuracy and system robustness. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper first
proposes a novel motor intention extraction framework based on a non-invasive
brain-muscle interface (BMuI)($\text{BCI} =
\frac{\text{Brain}}{\text{Computer}} \text{ Interface} =
\frac{\text{Brain}}{\not\text{Muscle}}\! \text{ (BMuI)} \times
\!\frac{\not\text{Muscle}}{\text{Computer}}\! \text{ Interface}$). This method
simulates the neural pathway from the brain to the muscles in order to capture
and enhance the weak motor intention signals originating in the brain. It then
uses EMG as a high-fidelity relay medium to achieve more accurate intention
recognition and transmission. To systematically validate the feasibility and
effectiveness of this approach, we conducted both offline experiments (to
repeatedly verify feasibility) and online experiments (to construct a real-time
interactive system and evaluate its performance). The results show that BMuI is
feasible, achieving a prediction accuracy of 0.8314; in the online experiment,
all participants are able to successfully control the Unity virtual arm.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as
they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This
paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot
system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of
our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert

question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to
leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a
seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current
mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in
robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior
adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both
quantitively and qualitatively.

Motivation: 当前CRS评估中，用户模拟器难以真实模拟多样化的用户行为和提供定量评分。

Method: RecUserSim包含用户画像模块、记忆模块、核心行为模块和优化模块，结合有限理性理论实现精细决策。

Result: 实验表明RecUserSim能生成多样、可控的输出，并产生高质量对话，评分在不同LLM中一致性高。

Conclusion: RecUserSim为CRS评估提供了有效的用户模拟工具，具有高真实性和多样性。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through
multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User
simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS,
but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work
leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they
still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios
and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address
these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with
enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores.
RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining
realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction
history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired
by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while
generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further
enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final
responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse,
controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with
smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency
across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.

Conclusion: 当前系统需人工监督，未来语音AI的进步有望实现更准确的评估，提升急救医疗水平。

Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides
anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke
evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video
capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert
review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke
recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with
sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays
in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten
simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion
(LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic
accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the
AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual
stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just
over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use
(mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but
also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert
physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct
diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary
treatment decisions in only 40% of cases due to observed AI errors including
incorrect scoring and false information. While the current system's limitations
necessitate human oversight, ongoing rapid advancements in speech-to-speech AI
models suggest that future versions are poised to enable highly accurate
assessments. Achieving human-level voice interaction could transform emergency
medical care, putting expert-informed assessment capabilities in everyone's
hands.

Abstract: The analysis of spatio-temporal data presents significant challenges due to
the complexity and heterogeneity of movement patterns. This project proposes a
data analytics tool that combines data visualization and statistical
computation to facilitate spatio-temporal data analysis through a multi-level
approach. The tool categorizes moving objects into distinct taxonomies using
Machine Learning models, adding meaningful structure to the analysis. Two case
studies demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness. The first analyzed Arctic
fox trajectories, successfully identifying and labeling foxes with Geometric or
Kinematic-based behaviors, further categorized into Curvature and Acceleration
groups. Statistical indicators revealed that foxes with Acceleration-based
behavior showed constant, steady acceleration, while those with Curvature-based
behavior exhibited acceleration peaks and sudden deceleration. The second case
study examined tropical cyclone data, labeling trajectories with Speed,
Curvature, and hybrid Geometric-based behaviors through unique statistical
variables. Analysis of hybrid Geometric behavior (Curvature and Indentation
combined) identified specific angles with the highest impact on hurricane shape
and geometry. The proposed method and tool demonstrate that spatio-temporal
data, despite inherent complexity, can be analyzed and explained in detail,
providing a theoretical and practical blueprint applicable to multiple domains.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了颜色对搜索效率，为信息嵌入提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large, high-resolution displays are installed throughout the city as public
displays. By superimposing invisible information on the images of these
displays, large numbers of devices with cameras and sensors can communicate
with the displays without prior pairing. Several applications have been
proposed, such as operating robots or communicating information to users by
displaying 2D codes on images. However, the display of 2D codes has the problem
of compromising the appearance of displayed content.
  Abe et al. proposed a method of communicating with devices by superimposing
invisible information using color vibration on images displayed on
off-the-shelf liquid-crystal displays (LCD). Using this method, we can embed
the information for devices in images without interfering with the displayed
content. Abe et al. uses a simple serial loop operation to search for color
pairs comprising a color vibration, which requires a very long processing time
due to the huge search space.
  In this paper, we propose an accelerated and optimized search method for
color pairs that constitute the imperceptible color vibration for embedding
information on LCD images. To achieve fast color pair search, we parallelized
the search process, which is previously done individually, by using arrays
representing the amount of movement and an operation to extract elements from
the array that satisfy the conditions. In addition, we investigate the amount
of information that can be superimposed on nine color images using the
imperceptible color vibration and clarify the applicability of embedding
information into images using the color vibration.

Result: 参与者对机器人使用态度复杂，关注情感责任和潜在风险，但也认可其在信息提供和减轻琐碎任务方面的价值。

Conclusion: 引入机器人时需综合考虑社会和无形的价值观，而不仅是财务因素，以确定其在组织中的合适角色。

Abstract: Recent technological advances have allowed robots to assist in the service
sector, and consequently accelerate job and sector transformation. Less
attention has been paid to the use of robots in real-world organisations where
social benefits, as opposed to profits, are the primary motivator. To explore
these opportunities, we have partnered with a working church and visitor
attraction. We conducted interviews with 15 participants from a range of
stakeholder groups within the church to understand worker perspectives of
introducing a social robot to the church and analysed the results using
reflexive thematic analysis. Findings indicate mixed responses to the use of a
robot, with participants highlighting the empathetic responsibility the church
has towards people and the potential for unintended consequences. However,
information provision and alleviation of menial or mundane tasks were
identified as potential use cases. This highlights the need to consider not
only the financial aspects of robot introduction, but also how social and
intangible values shape what roles a robot should take on within an
organisation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估自由形式、视觉多样的科学草图时缺乏可解释性、教学对齐性和跨认知水平的适应性。

Method: SketchMind采用模块化智能体，负责评分标准解析、草图感知、认知对齐和迭代反馈，支持个性化透明评估。

Result: 在3,575份学生草图的测试中，SketchMind平均准确率达77.1%，比基线模型提升21.4%；人类评估反馈质量显著优于基线。

Conclusion: SketchMind通过多智能体协作和认知对齐，有效支持学生概念成长，具有在AI驱动教育中的潜力。

Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students'
conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such
free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing
solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task
or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical
alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these
limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent
framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches.
SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch
perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch
modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate
SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six
science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that
require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline
GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG
integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We
also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind
performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch
prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items.
Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by
\textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5,
significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o).
Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth
through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be
released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在机器人系统中生成社会和文化适应性情感触觉行为的潜力。

Method: 生成12种情感在三种文化背景下的触觉描述，由90名参与者评估解码和适当性。

Result: 文化匹配下六种情感可解码；人机交互角色不对称；文化不匹配降低准确性和适当性。

Conclusion: LLMs在跨文化情感触觉行为生成中表现有限，需进一步优化文化适应性和交互设计。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into robotic
systems, their potential to generate socially and culturally appropriate
affective touch remains largely unexplored. This study investigates whether
LLMs-specifically GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o --can generate culturally adaptive
tactile behaviours to convey emotions in human-robot interaction. We produced
text based touch descriptions for 12 distinct emotions across three cultural
contexts (Chinese, Belgian, and unspecified), and examined their
interpretability in both robot-to-human and human-to-robot scenarios. A total
of 90 participants (36 Chinese, 36 Belgian, and 18 culturally unspecified)
evaluated these LLM-generated tactile behaviours for emotional decoding and
perceived appropriateness. Results reveal that: (1) under matched cultural
conditions, participants successfully decoded six out of twelve emotions-mainly
socially oriented emotions such as love and Ekman emotions such as anger,
however, self-focused emotions like pride and embarrassment were more difficult
to interpret; (2) tactile behaviours were perceived as more appropriate when
directed from human to robot than from robot to human, revealing an asymmetry
in social expectations based on interaction roles; (3) behaviours interpreted
as aggressive (e.g., anger), overly intimate (e.g., love), or emotionally
ambiguous (i.e., not clearly decodable) were significantly more likely to be
rated as inappropriate; and (4) cultural mismatches reduced decoding accuracy
and increased the likelihood of behaviours being judged as inappropriate.

### [133] [Automated Label Placement on Maps via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22952)
*Harry Shomer,Jiejun Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的自动标签放置（ALP）新范式，通过检索增强生成（RAG）整合标注指南，并评估了四种开源LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标签放置是地图设计的关键，但现有自动化系统难以整合制图惯例或适应上下文，亟需一种可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 将ALP任务视为数据编辑问题，利用RAG检索相关标注指南，并通过指令调优的LLMs生成理想标签坐标。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在结构化提示和领域特定检索的引导下，能够生成符合专家制图标准的标签位置。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI辅助地图完成提供了可扩展框架，展示了基础模型在结构化数据编辑任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of
spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite
its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,
as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,
adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates
the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)
for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate
MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world
maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from
open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each
landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them
into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label
coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall
performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This
includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific
retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated
outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a
scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential
of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: ChatVis是一个辅助LLM生成ParaView科学可视化Python代码的工具，通过链式思维提示简化、检索增强提示生成和错误检查，显著提升了LLM在专业任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在专业编程任务（如科学可视化）中表现不佳，需要一种无需重新训练或微调的方法来提升其能力。

Method: 采用链式思维提示简化、检索增强提示生成（利用向量数据库存储文档和代码示例）及迭代提示反馈进行错误检查，直至生成可视化结果。

Result: 通过基准测试评估，ChatVis在所有指标上均显著优于未辅助的LLM。

Conclusion: ChatVis有效提升了LLM在科学可视化任务中的表现，无需额外训练或微调。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly increasing in capability, but they
still struggle with highly specialized programming tasks such as scientific
visualization. We present an LLM assistant, ChatVis, that aids the LLM to
generate Python code for ParaView scientific visualization tasks, without the
need for retraining or fine-tuning the LLM. ChatVis employs chain-of-thought
prompt simplification, retrieval-augmented prompt generation using a vector
database of documentation and code examples, and error checking with iterative
prompt feedback to correct errors until a visualization is produced. An
integral part of our approach is a benchmark suite of canonical visualization
tasks, ParaView regression tests, and scientific use cases that includes
comprehensive evaluation metrics. We evaluate our visualization assistant by
comparing results with a variety of top-performing unassisted LLMs. We find
that all the metrics are significantly improved with ChatVis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网球分析设备需在球拍或主导臂上安装传感器，影响运动自然性和舒适性。

Method: 利用非主导臂的惯性测量单元数据，开发神经网络模型，检测和分类六种击球动作。

Result: 分类准确率达88.2%，检测F1分数为86.0%，用户研究显示使用体验更舒适。

Conclusion: 非主导臂可作为网球动作分析的有效且舒适的替代方案，推动了用户友好的运动分析技术。

Abstract: Wearable technology has transformed sports analytics, offering new dimensions
in enhancing player experience. Yet, many solutions involve cumbersome setups
that inhibit natural motion. In tennis, existing products require sensors on
the racket or dominant arm, causing distractions and discomfort. We propose
Silent Impact, a novel and user-friendly system that analyzes tennis shots
using a sensor placed on the passive arm. Collecting Inertial Measurement Unit
sensor data from 20 recreational tennis players, we developed neural networks
that exclusively utilize passive arm data to detect and classify six shots,
achieving a classification accuracy of 88.2% and a detection F1 score of 86.0%,
comparable to the dominant arm. These models were then incorporated into an
end-to-end prototype, which records passive arm motion through a smartwatch and
displays a summary of shots on a mobile app. User study (N=10) showed that
participants felt less burdened physically and mentally using Silent Impact on
the passive arm. Overall, our research establishes the passive arm as an
effective, comfortable alternative for tennis shot analysis, advancing
user-friendly sports analytics.

TL;DR: DUET是一个基于LLM的工具，用于比较学生和参考UML/ER图并提供反馈，支持自主学习和教学策略改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统教学方法难以提供个性化反馈，尤其是在大班教学中，DUET旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DUET通过多阶段LLM管道比较图表差异，生成结构化反馈，并支持教育者分析。

Result: 评估显示DUET在可访问性、扩展性和学习支持方面表现良好，但也存在可靠性和潜在滥用问题。

Conclusion: DUET为LLM在建模教育中的应用提供了方向，未来需进一步课堂整合和实证评估。

Abstract: UML and ER diagrams are foundational in computer science education but come
with challenges for learners due to the need for abstract thinking, contextual
understanding, and mastery of both syntax and semantics. These complexities are
difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle
to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We
introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML & ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool,
which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a
textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the
differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and
generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights
for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional
strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six
participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They
identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support
alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants
also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and
interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for
integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future
classroom integration and empirical evaluation.

TL;DR: 研究比较了五种数字素养干预方法，提升人们辨别深度伪造（deepfake）的能力，结果显示干预效果显著且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造图像可能破坏社会信任，而现有数字素养提升方法缺乏可扩展性和有效性。

Method: 实验比较了五种干预方法：文本指导、视觉演示、游戏化练习、隐式学习及AI生成解释，涉及1,200名美国参与者。

Result: 干预使深度伪造辨别能力提升高达13个百分点，同时保持对真实图像的信任。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展、适用于多样化人群，能有效提升深度伪造检测能力且不损害对真实信息的信任。

Abstract: Deepfakes, i.e., images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), can erode
trust in institutions and compromise election outcomes, as people often
struggle to discern real images from deepfakes. Improving digital literacy can
help address these challenges, yet scalable and effective approaches remain
largely unexplored. Here, we compare the efficacy of five digital literacy
interventions to boost people's ability to discern deepfakes: (1) textual
guidance on common indicators of deepfakes; (2) visual demonstrations of these
indicators; (3) a gamified exercise for identifying deepfakes; (4) implicit
learning through repeated exposure and feedback; and (5) explanations of how
deepfakes are generated with the help of AI. We conducted an experiment with
N=1,200 participants from the United States to test the immediate and long-term
effectiveness of our interventions. Our results show that our interventions can
boost deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points while maintaining
trust in real images. Altogether, our approach is scalable, suitable for
diverse populations, and highly effective for boosting deepfake detection while
maintaining trust in truthful information.

*Sophia Liu,Shm Garanganao Almeda*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出“超文本摩擦”概念，旨在通过强调摩擦、可追溯性和结构来恢复用户在算法驱动界面中的控制权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前算法驱动的界面（如推荐系统和生成式AI工具）以牺牲用户控制权为代价追求参与度和效率，用户对内容及其关系的控制减弱。

Method: 通过比较分析（如Wikipedia与Instagram Explore、Are.na与GenAI图像工具），研究不同系统如何构建用户体验、导航和创作。

Result: 超文本系统强调来源、关联思维和用户驱动的意义构建，而算法系统则模糊过程并简化参与。

Conclusion: 论文贡献了（1）界面结构如何影响用户与代理驱动系统中的控制权比较分析，（2）提出超文本价值作为设计原则，以在算法化网络中恢复用户控制权。

Abstract: Today's algorithm-driven interfaces, from recommendation feeds to GenAI
tools, often prioritize engagement and efficiency at the expense of user
agency. As systems take on more decision-making, users have less control over
what they see and how meaning or relationships between content are constructed.
This paper introduces "Hypertextual Friction," a conceptual design stance that
repositions classical hypertext principles--friction, traceability, and
structure--as actionable values for reclaiming agency in algorithmically
mediated environments. Through a comparative analysis of real-world
interfaces--Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore, and Are.na vs. GenAI image
tools--we examine how different systems structure user experience, navigation,
and authorship. We show that hypertext systems emphasize provenance,
associative thinking, and user-driven meaning-making, while algorithmic systems
tend to obscure process and flatten participation. We contribute: (1) a
comparative analysis of how interface structures shape agency in user-driven
versus agent-driven systems, and (2) a conceptual stance that offers
hypertextual values as design commitments for reclaiming agency in an
increasingly algorithmic web.

Conclusion: 该方法为多智能体自动驾驶系统提供了新方向，有望提升复杂交通环境中的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Since the advent of autonomous driving technology, it has experienced
remarkable progress over the last decade. However, most existing research still
struggles to address the challenges posed by environments where multiple
vehicles have to interact seamlessly. This study aims to integrate causal
learning with reinforcement learning-based methods by leveraging causal
disentanglement representation learning (CDRL) to identify and extract causal
features that influence optimal decision-making in autonomous vehicles. These
features are then incorporated into graph neural network-based reinforcement
learning algorithms to enhance decision-making in complex traffic scenarios. By
using causal features as inputs, the proposed approach enables the optimization
of vehicle behavior at an unsignalized intersection. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the highest average reward during
training and our approach significantly outperforms other learning-based
methods in several key metrics such as collision rate and average cumulative
reward during testing. This study provides a promising direction for advancing
multi-agent autonomous driving systems and make autonomous vehicles' navigation
safer and more efficient in complex traffic environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基于代理的模拟非侵入性地评估社会政策，但现有方法在行为建模和公平性衡量上存在差异，需结合CA框架提升政策评估效果。

Method: 定义强化学习环境，代理在政策约束下恢复能力，结合当地利益相关者和专家，应用于巴塞罗那无家可归者案例。

Result: 首次提出与CA框架对齐的概念验证模拟，用于评估议会讨论中的政策影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为政策评估提供了新工具，尤其在解决健康不平等问题上具有潜力。

Abstract: Agent-based simulations have an enormous potential as tools to evaluate
social policies in a non-invasive way, before these are implemented to
real-world populations. However, the recommendations that these computational
approaches may offer to tackle urgent human development challenges can vary
substantially depending on how we model agents' (people) behaviour and the
criteria that we use to measure inequity. In this paper, we integrate the
conceptual framework of the capability approach (CA), which is explicitly
designed to promote and assess human well-being, to guide the simulation and
evaluate the effectiveness of policies. We define a reinforcement learning
environment where agents behave to restore their capabilities under the
constraints of a specific policy. Working in collaboration with local
stakeholders, non-profits and domain experts, we apply our model in a case
study to mitigate health inequity among the population experiencing
homelessness (PEH) in Barcelona. By doing so, we present the first proof of
concept simulation, aligned with the CA for human development, to assess the
impact of policies under parliamentary discussion.

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive examination of agent-based approaches that codify
the principles and linkages underlying multi-agent systems, simulations, and

framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms. Our
findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究玩家如何通过假设检验和效用驱动探索动态更新策略，以实现博弈中的均衡收敛与选择。

Method: 玩家形成对对手策略的信念，并通过经验观察周期性测试这些信念；信念在假设检验被拒绝或通过探索时重新采样。

Result: 学习过程在一般有限博弈中收敛到近似纳什均衡集，并进一步选择最大化所有玩家最低效用的均衡。

Conclusion: 该学习动态不仅实现均衡收敛，还通过其结构诱导了均衡选择机制。

Abstract: We introduce a new hypothesis testing-based learning dynamics in which
players update their strategies by combining hypothesis testing with
utility-driven exploration. In this dynamics, each player forms beliefs about
opponents' strategies and episodically tests these beliefs using empirical
observations. Beliefs are resampled either when the hypothesis test is rejected
or through exploration, where the probability of exploration decreases with the
player's (transformed) utility. In general finite normal-form games, we show
that the learning process converges to a set of approximate Nash equilibria
and, more importantly, to a refinement that selects equilibria maximizing the
minimum (transformed) utility across all players. Our result establishes
convergence to equilibrium in general finite games and reveals a novel
mechanism for equilibrium selection induced by the structure of the learning
dynamics.

Conclusion: 论文成功地将相互依赖估值模型扩展到组合问题，填补了现有研究的空白，并在战略设置下提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study online combinatorial allocation problems in the secretary setting,
under interdependent values. In the interdependent model, introduced by Milgrom
and Weber (1982), each agent possesses a private signal that captures her
information about an item for sale, and the value of every agent depends on the
signals held by all agents. Mauras, Mohan, and Reiffenh\"auser (2024) were the
first to study interdependent values in online settings, providing
constant-approximation guarantees for secretary settings, where agents arrive
online along with their signals and values, and the goal is to select the agent
with the highest value.
  In this work, we extend this framework to {\em combinatorial} secretary
problems, where agents have interdependent valuations over {\em bundles} of
items, introducing additional challenges due to both combinatorial structure
and interdependence. We provide $2e$-competitive algorithms for a broad class
of valuation functions, including submodular and XOS functions, matching the
approximation guarantees in the single-choice secretary setting. Furthermore,
our results cover the same range of valuation classes for which constant-factor
algorithms exist in classical (non-interdependent) secretary settings, while
incurring only an additional factor of $2$ due to interdependence. Finally, we
extend our study to strategic settings, and provide a $4e$-competitive truthful
mechanism for online bipartite matching with interdependent valuations, again
meeting the frontier of what is known, even without interdependence.

Conclusion: 该模型为神经形态工程提供了理论基础和功能路线图，类似于生物神经元的信息传递和节律生成双重功能。

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDTR技术用于多层薄膜热特性表征，但提取多参数时存在高维度和非凸解空间的挑战，现有全局优化算法难以在60秒内可靠收敛。

Method: 结合四种全局优化算法（GA、QGA、PSO、FWA）与拟牛顿局部细化方法，生成四种混合变体（HGA、HQGA、HPSO、HFWA），并评估其性能。

Result: HPSO表现最佳，80%的试验在60秒内达到目标适应值，且收敛速度比其他方法快五倍。

Conclusion: HPSO为热计量中的逆问题提供了通用解决方案，并可扩展到其他模型拟合技术。

Abstract: Frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) is a widely used technique for
characterizing thermal properties of multilayer thin films. However, extracting
multiple parameters from FDTR measurements presents a nonlinear inverse problem
due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This
study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm
(GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of
a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60
seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven
hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a
Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA,
HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80%
of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater
robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of
HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then
evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each
algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA
consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster
than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems
in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting
techniques.

Abstract: Accurate finger force estimation is critical for next-generation
human-machine interfaces. Traditional electromyography (EMG)-based decoding
methods using deep learning require large datasets and high computational
resources, limiting their use in real-time, embedded systems. Here, we propose
a novel approach that performs finger force regression using spike trains from
individual motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These biologically
grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal
neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our
method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time
inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous
regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware. Our results confirm
accurate finger-specific force prediction with minimal energy use, opening new
possibilities for embedded decoding in prosthetics and wearable
neurotechnology.

Motivation: 脑老化合成在临床和计算神经科学中有广泛应用，但高维数据、年龄间细微结构变化和个体特异性模式是主要挑战。

Method: NeuroAR通过自回归变换器生成未来脑扫描的标记图，结合先前的扫描和目标年龄信息，利用交叉注意力机制引导生成。

Conclusion: NeuroAR能够高保真地模拟个体特异性脑老化轨迹，显著优于关键模型（如LDM）。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 正在取代多层感知机 (MLPs) 用于科学机器学习，因其更好的可解释性、灵活性和高效建模能力。本文从数据驱动学习、物理建模和深度算子学习三个角度综述了 KANs 的进展，并对比了其与 MLPs 的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLPs 存在可解释性差、激活函数固定、难以捕捉局部或高频特征等问题，KANs 能有效解决这些限制。

Method: 从数据驱动学习、物理建模和深度算子学习三个角度分析 KANs 的架构设计、训练策略和应用效果，并与 MLPs 进行对比。

Result: KANs 在准确性、收敛性和频谱表示上优于 MLPs，能更高效地捕捉复杂动态。

Conclusion: KANs 在科学机器学习中展现出显著优势，但仍需解决计算效率、理论保证等问题，未来研究方向包括提升鲁棒性和物理一致性。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

Motivation: 探索多模态潜在空间在逆向任务中的潜力，填补现有研究空白。

Result: 实验表明，逆向映射虽能实现文本对齐，但感知质量差且语义不可解释。

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间缺乏逆向映射所需结构，需进一步研究开发语义丰富且可逆的潜在空间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化加剧了极端气候对农业的风险，传统单灾害预测方法无法捕捉复杂的气候事件交互作用，因此需要智能化的多灾害预警系统。

Method: 结合序列深度学习模型（如BiLSTM）和XAI技术（如TimeSHAP），构建多灾害预测框架，并利用美国四个农业区的气象数据进行验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架具有较高的预测准确性，尤其是BiLSTM架构，并能提供详细的时间解释。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了多灾害预警系统的可解释性和实用性，有助于农业气候风险管理的决策制定。

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

Conclusion: 样本感知的结构灵活性对多智能体系统设计至关重要。

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

Motivation: 城市热浪加剧，传统物理模型计算成本高，难以大规模应用，需高效工具支持城市热适应规划。

Method: 提出GSM-UTCI框架，融合地表形态、土地覆盖和气象数据，采用FiLM架构动态调整空间特征，训练基于SOLWEIG的UTCI数据。

Result: 模型R2达0.9151，MAE为0.41°C，计算时间从小时缩短至5分钟；应用于费城绿化场景，显示显著降温效果。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI是高效、精细的城市热适应决策工具，支持多样化绿化策略评估。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Motivation: 共享单车系统中，用户需求的时空变化导致库存不平衡，增加了调度成本，因此需要通过动态定价优化需求管理。

Method: 开发了一种可微分代理模拟方法，快速设计动态定价策略，考虑了用户多样性和概率性选择。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比传统方法损失减少73%-78%，收敛速度提升100倍以上，且在大规模系统中能自然实现库存平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少调度成本，并通过合理初始条件最小化折扣成本。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

Result: 指出现有评估方法缺乏理论和实证支持，呼吁转向AI专用框架。

Conclusion: 应停止使用人类测试评估AI，开发针对AI的评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

Motivation: LLM推理因内存和计算需求高而面临挑战，现有WAQ设计在低精度下存在精度损失和异常检测问题。

Method: 提出KLLM框架，采用基于索引的计算方案和Orizuru异常检测引擎，避免去量化和全精度计算。

Result: 实验显示KLLM在A100 GPU和Atom上分别实现9.67x和7.03x加速，能效提升229.50x和150.21x。

Conclusion: KLLM有效解决了WAQ中的关键问题，显著提升了LLM推理的效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Conclusion: 基于时间序列的行为分析方法能更细致地揭示个体行为对流程效率的影响，为流程优化提供新视角。

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Method: 研究分析了10,288名接受万古霉素的ICU患者，使用SelectKBest和随机森林筛选特征，测试了六种算法，并通过SHAP、ALE和贝叶斯后验采样评估可解释性。

Result: CatBoost表现最佳（AUROC 0.818），关键预测因子包括磷酸盐、总胆红素、镁等。SHAP确认磷酸盐为主要风险因素。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确预测万古霉素相关肌酐升高，支持ICU中的早期风险检测和及时干预。

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed

obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

TL;DR: 该研究填补了边缘设备在AI推理性能和能耗方面的研究空白，分析了传统、神经网络和大语言模型在多种边缘设备上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备在AI推理中的性能和能耗是关键因素，但目前缺乏相关研究以指导设备与模型选择。

Method: 通过分析模型F1分数、推理时间、功耗和内存使用之间的权衡，结合硬件和框架优化及模型参数调整。

Result: 研究发现硬件和框架优化及模型参数调整可以在模型性能和资源使用之间实现平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究为实际边缘AI部署提供了设备与模型选择的依据。

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

TL;DR: BiGG-E是一种自回归模型，扩展自BiGG模型，用于学习加权图的联合分布，同时利用稀疏性高效生成图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度生成模型大多针对无权图或未考虑边权重与拓扑的联合分布，而加权图在多个领域广泛应用，需要更高效的生成方法。

Method: 开发了BiGG-E模型，通过学习加权图的联合分布，并利用稀疏性实现高效生成，时间复杂度为O((n + m)log n)。

Result: 实验表明，BiGG-E能更好地捕捉加权图分布，同时保持可扩展性和计算效率。

Conclusion: BiGG-E为加权图生成提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据隐私协议允许用户选择不共享数据，加上设备异构性导致的延迟，导致数据缺失，引入偏差并降低模型性能。

Method: 提出FLOSS系统，通过技术手段减轻缺失数据对联邦学习的影响。

Result: 通过模拟实验验证了FLOSS系统的性能提升效果。

Conclusion: FLOSS能有效应对联邦学习中的数据缺失问题，提升模型表现。

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Result: 噪声感知训练在部分配置中提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 噪声增强对语音模型泛化具有潜在益处，但也存在局限性。

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such
relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

Result: 研究发现后悔值在某些数据集群体中更高，并展示了后悔值估计如何通过弃权和数据收集提升实际应用的安全性。

Conclusion: 后悔值是一种有效的工具，可用于评估和提升概率分类任务的安全性和可解释性。

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种DEs上优于现有技术，实现了高效训练和更高精度。

Conclusion: 该工作使AI求解DEs在自然和工程领域真正可用。

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市热浪、干旱和土地退化在气候变化背景下日益严峻，需要高精度的时空信息来研究这些问题。LST是关键变量，但卫星数据在时空分辨率上存在固有局限。

Method: FuseTen采用生成架构，结合注意力机制和归一化模块，使用基于物理原理的监督策略和PatchGAN判别器提升数据融合的准确性。

Result: 实验表明，FuseTen在定量指标上平均提升32.06%，视觉保真度提升31.42%，优于线性基线方法。

Conclusion: FuseTen是首个能以10米空间分辨率生成每日LST的非线性方法，为研究地表热状态提供了新工具。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

our analysis shows that no model can simultaneously optimize for all three. We
formally prove this trade-off and propose a principled framework named The BAR
Theorem for LLM-application design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用NaN传播检测黑箱函数稀疏性的方法，避免传统有限差分法的假阴性问题，显著提升了梯度计算的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限差分法在稀疏性检测中因偶然零梯度导致假阴性，可能破坏梯度计算。

Method: 通过系统性地用NaN污染输入并观察输出，重建保守的稀疏模式，消除假阴性。

Result: 在航空航天翼重模型中实现了1.52倍加速，检测到传统方法遗漏的依赖关系。

Conclusion: 该方法利用IEEE 754标准，无需修改黑箱代码，适用于多种编程语言和数学库，显著优化了梯度计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

Result: 在49.4页平均长度的文档上，查询延迟降低45%，在MMLongBench-Doc基准测试中准确率达64.7%。

Conclusion: DocsRay通过免训练方法有效提升了多模态文档理解的效率和性能。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 揭示了内部低维幻觉跟踪机制，可用于检测和缓解问题，并发布了ContraTales基准数据集。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私保护需求增加，机器遗忘（让模型“忘记”特定训练数据）受到关注。传统基于影响的遗忘方法计算Hessian矩阵及其逆矩阵的开销过大，难以应用于大规模模型和频繁数据删除场景。

Method: 通过理论连接记忆（增量学习）与遗忘（机器遗忘），提出IAU算法，利用增量学习中高效的梯度优化替代传统Hessian计算。

Result: 实验表明，IAU在删除保证、遗忘效率和模型性能之间取得了优越的平衡，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IAU算法为高效机器遗忘提供了新思路，验证了从增量学习视角解决遗忘问题的可行性。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

Result: 发现样本的隐私风险在训练早期就已确定，且与其内在学习难度密切相关。

Conclusion: 为隐私感知的模型训练策略提供了理论基础，揭示了隐私风险的动态演变过程。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers提供了一种高效、可靠的方法来构建流式序列模型，适用于生产环境。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 结构化过程奖励能显著加速LRM在数学推理任务中的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

*Tung M. Luu,Donghoon Lee,Younghwan Lee,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLARE利用视觉语言模型（VLM）为离线强化学习提供指导信号，避免手动设计奖励函数，在机器人任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习需要奖励标签数据，但奖励函数设计成本高且复杂。PLARE旨在通过VLM提供偏好标签，简化训练过程。

Method: PLARE通过VLM对视觉轨迹段进行偏好标注，使用监督对比偏好学习目标直接训练策略，无需显式奖励模型。

Result: 在MetaWorld任务中，PLARE性能达到或超过现有VLM奖励生成方法，并在真实机器人任务中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: PLARE提供了一种高效且实用的离线强化学习解决方案，适用于真实世界的机器人任务。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

*Diana Mortagua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于知识推荐系统的新策略，通过考虑标注者的情绪和疲劳水平等内部因素，减少主动学习中的标注错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动学习在减少标注数据需求的同时，仍需降低标注错误以提高效率。现有方法未充分考虑标注者的内部因素（如情绪、疲劳）对标注质量的影响。

Method: 使用知识推荐系统（RS）对标注者进行排名，结合其历史准确率、情绪和疲劳水平，以及查询实例信息，选择最佳标注者。

Result: 考虑内部因素显著减少了标注错误和模型训练中的不确定性，准确率和F1分数也有所提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决人类认知因素对主动学习的影响提供了初步探索，展示了内部因素的重要性。

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术在top-k预测中无法精确认证真实标签，且存在组合爆炸问题。

Method: CostCert通过验证攻击预算是否不足以覆盖最小额外投票数，从而避免成对比较和组合爆炸。

Result: 实验表明，CostCert显著优于现有技术PatchGuard，如在补丁大小为96时，认证准确率仍保持57.3%，而PatchGuard已降至零。

Conclusion: CostCert是一种高效且精确的防御方法，适用于对抗性补丁攻击的认证恢复。

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

Conclusion: 因果解释提高了概念漂移解释的可操作性，为实际应用提供了有效支持。

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting
honey adulteration utilizing honey mineral element profiles. The proposed
system comprises two phases: preprocessing and classification. The
preprocessing phase involves the treatment of missing-value attributes and
normalization. In the classifica-tion phase, we use three supervised ML models:
logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, to dis-criminate between
authentic and adulterated honey. To evaluate the performance of the ML models,
we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of
authentic honey, sugar syrups, and adul-terated honey. Experimental findings
show that mineral element content in honey provides robust discriminative
information for detecting honey adulteration. Results also demonstrate that the
random forest-based classifier outperforms other classifiers on this dataset,
achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.37%.

milk samples into authentic or adulterated. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed system using a public dataset comprising Fourier Transform Infrared

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中表现优于替代方案，参数更少且性能与现有基线相当，同时验证了时间记忆的优势。

Conclusion: 时空分解的算子学习方法在高效和通用PDE建模中具有优势，并提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

Conclusion: Coflex为HW-NAS提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了搜索效率和性能。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

Result: 证明在结构不确定性高、因果效应差异大且损失函数敏感时，模型平均方法有效，并通过模拟验证。

Conclusion: 该方法补充了现有因果推理方法，解决了实践中常被忽视的不确定性来源。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态集成聚合方法（如取最小值）在连续控制任务中可能丢弃有价值信息且无法适应任务需求或学习阶段。DEA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DEA通过两个可学习的方向参数（分别调节保守性和探索性）和基于Bellman误差的加权机制，动态调整Q值估计的聚合方式。

Result: 在多种连续控制任务和学习模式下，DEA表现优于静态集成策略。

Conclusion: DEA通过数据驱动的自适应聚合机制，显著提升了Q值估计的准确性和任务性能。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

Motivation: 探讨验证时间与证书长度之间的关系，为复杂性类分离和自然问题分析提供理论基础。

Method: 通过证明Verifier Trade-off定理，构建基于证书复杂性的层次结构。

Result: 定理适用于分析复杂性类分离（如NP与EXPTIME）及自然问题（如字符串周期性和旋转检测）。

Conclusion: 研究为P与NP问题提供了新视角，探讨了次线性证书的存在性。

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

Motivation: 现有高概率收敛分析要求裁剪阈值随优化步骤增加，这与标准DP机制（如高斯机制）不兼容，因此需要一种固定裁剪阈值的方法。

Method: 采用固定裁剪阈值的DP-Clipped-SGD方法，适用于重尾噪声下的凸和非凸平滑优化，假设噪声具有有界中心α阶矩。

Result: 方法以固定裁剪阈值收敛到最优解邻域，收敛速度优于现有方法，且邻域大小可与DP引入的噪声平衡。

Conclusion: 固定裁剪阈值的DP-Clipped-SGD在收敛速度和隐私保证之间提供了更优的权衡，适用于重尾噪声场景。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: 合成边界数据作为隐式正则化器，显著提升了持续学习的性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is
online.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power
consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range
of robotic tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation
of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two
classical control tasks. The network is trained using the Q-learning algorithm,
then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded
deployment on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic chip. To evaluate the comparative
advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our
results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy
neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption.
Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements
observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for
real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a
compelling direction for efficient deep Q-learning.

Motivation: 解决高维数据中特征选择的组合优化问题，克服贪婪方法忽略特征间依赖关系的局限性。

Method: 使用模拟退火进行全局搜索，以Fisher判别比作为分类任务中模型质量的代理指标。

Result: 实验表明SA-FDR能选出更紧凑的特征子集，同时保持高预测精度，优于贪婪方法。

Conclusion: SA-FDR为高维数据提供了一种灵活且高效的特征选择方法，尤其适用于稀疏性、可解释性和性能要求高的场景。

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1显著提升了LLM在多跳推理中的能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多元曲线分辨率（MCR）方法依赖用户指定组件数量且在大规模数据或高组件数量时表现不佳，需要一种更高效、自动化的解决方案。

Method: 将MCR重新定义为生成过程（gMCR），并引入基于能量的深度学习求解器（EB-gMCR），通过可微分门控网络从候选池中筛选活跃组件并估计其浓度。

Result: 在含256个潜在源的合成数据集上，EB-gMCR保持R^2≥0.98，组件数量估计误差在5%以内；低噪声时R^2≥0.99且组件估计接近精确。

Conclusion: EB-gMCR结合高容量生成建模和硬组件选择，为大规模信号解混分析提供了实用解决方案，并可灵活适应其他领域或仪器。

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Result: 揭示了softmax注意力的表达力强于线性注意力的原因。

Conclusion: 通过RNN框架解释了softmax注意力的优越性，为未来注意力机制设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across

OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and

dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff在微生物组数据插补中表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an

*Justin Kay,Grant Van Horn,Subhransu Maji,Daniel Sheldon,Sara Beery*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CODA提出了一种主动模型选择方法，通过利用候选模型的预测结果优先标注能高效区分最佳模型的数据点，显著减少标注工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型选择需要大量标注验证数据，成本高且耗时。CODA旨在通过主动学习减少标注需求。

Method: CODA采用概率框架建模分类器、类别和数据点之间的关系，利用模型间的共识与分歧指导标注过程，并通过贝叶斯推断更新模型选择。

Result: 在26个基准任务上，CODA比现有方法减少70%以上的标注工作量，显著提升模型选择效率。

Conclusion: CODA为模型选择提供了一种高效且成本低的解决方案，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

*Peter F. Michael,Zekun Hao,Serge Belongie,Abe Davis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过在场景光照中嵌入细微噪声调制的方法，为视频添加时间水印，以对抗伪造视频的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频伪造技术的进步，伪造视频与真实视频越来越难以区分，这为恶意行为者提供了优势。论文旨在通过技术手段创造信息不对称，以支持验证。

Method: 在场景光照中编码细微的噪声调制，为视频添加时间水印，水印记录了未篡改场景在编码光照下的图像。

Result: 即使对手知道该方法，伪造带有编码光照的假视频仍需解决更复杂的逆向问题，从而增加了伪造难度。

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险场景（如公共活动和采访）提供了一种有前景的保护手段，尤其是在光照可控但摄像机不可控的情况下。

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms
race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to
detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this
race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real
ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those
manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider
authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very
subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat
this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.
Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under
coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this
watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit
only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that
our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to
solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content
creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for
protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the
content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the
illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

TL;DR: XSpecMesh是一种用于加速自回归网格生成模型的方法，通过并行预测多个标记和验证策略，实现1.7倍加速且不损失生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归模型生成高质量网格时需大量标记预测，导致延迟高，XSpecMesh旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用轻量级多头推测解码方案并行预测标记，结合验证与重采样策略，并通过蒸馏策略训练解码头。

Result: 实验表明，XSpecMesh实现了1.7倍的加速，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: XSpecMesh是一种高效且质量保持的加速方法，适用于自回归网格生成模型。

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically
precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of
thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial
latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for
auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,
multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel
within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further
propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies
each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality
criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the
lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging
their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of
speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will
be released.

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern
highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop
visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter
through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures
the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a
novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches
in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring
full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a
wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the
real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer,
achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle
planner.

Abstract: Automatic extrinsic sensor calibration is a fundamental problem for
multi-sensor platforms. Reliable and general-purpose solutions should be
computationally efficient, require few assumptions about the structure of the
sensing environment, and demand little effort from human operators. Since the
engineering effort required to obtain accurate calibration parameters increases
with the number of sensors deployed, robotics researchers have pursued methods
requiring few assumptions about the sensing environment and minimal effort from
human operators. In this work, we introduce a fast and certifiably globally
optimal algorithm for solving a generalized formulation of the
$\textit{robot-world and hand-eye calibration}$ (RWHEC) problem. The
formulation of RWHEC presented is "generalized" in that it supports the
simultaneous estimation of multiple sensor and target poses, and permits the
use of monocular cameras that, alone, are unable to measure the scale of their
environments. In addition to demonstrating our method's superior performance
over existing solutions, we derive novel identifiability criteria and establish
$\textit{a priori}$ guarantees of global optimality for problem instances with
bounded measurement errors. We also introduce a complementary Lie-algebraic
local solver for RWHEC and compare its performance with our global method and
prior art. Finally, we provide a free and open-source implementation of our
algorithms and experiments.

Abstract: Quadruped robots face persistent challenges in achieving versatile locomotion
due to limitations in reference motion data diversity. To address these
challenges, this approach introduces an in-between motion generation based
multi-style quadruped robot locomotion framework, integrating synergistic
advances in motion generation and imitation learning. Our approach establishes
a unified pipeline addressing two fundamental aspects: First, we propose a CVAE
based motion generator, synthesizing multi-style dynamically feasible
locomotion sequences between arbitrary start and end states. By embedding
physical constraints and leveraging joint poses based phase manifold
continuity, this component produces physically plausible motions spanning
multiple gait modalities while ensuring kinematic compatibility with robotic
morphologies. Second, we adopt the adversarial motion priors algorithm. We
validate the effectiveness of generated motion data in enhancing controller
stability and improving velocity tracking performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates significant improvements in velocity tracking and deployment
stability. We successfully deploy the framework on a real-world quadruped
robot, and the experimental validation confirms the framework's capability to
generate and execute complex motion profiles, including gallop, tripod,
trotting and pacing.

Conclusion: 感知代理为动态手术环境中的实时AI辅助提供了更自然的交互方式。

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those
designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine
interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive
aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited
flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic
surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific
pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work
introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),
and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine
interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a
memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,
Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen
elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the
ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes
a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through
quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our
agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting
strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting
novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated
dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity,
our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in
dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

Conclusion: MTBench为MTRL研究提供了统一框架，并展示了大规模并行化的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) has emerged as a critical training
paradigm for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to a set of complex
real-world robotic tasks, which demands a generalizable and robust policy. At
the same time, \emph{massively parallelized training} has gained popularity,
not only for significantly accelerating data collection through GPU-accelerated
simulation but also for enabling diverse data collection across multiple tasks
by simulating heterogeneous scenes in parallel. However, existing MTRL research
has largely been limited to off-policy methods like SAC in the
low-parallelization regime. MTRL could capitalize on the higher asymptotic
performance of on-policy algorithms, whose batches require data from the
current policy, and as a result, take advantage of massive parallelization
offered by GPU-accelerated simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
massively parallelized $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{Bench}$mark
for robotics (MTBench), an open-sourced benchmark featuring a broad
distribution of 50 manipulation tasks and 20 locomotion tasks, implemented
using the GPU-accelerated simulator IsaacGym. MTBench also includes four base
RL algorithms combined with seven state-of-the-art MTRL algorithms and
architectures, providing a unified framework for evaluating their performance.
Our extensive experiments highlight the superior speed of evaluating MTRL
approaches using MTBench, while also uncovering unique challenges that arise
from combining massive parallelism with MTRL. Code is available at

Abstract: There has been significant advancement in legged robot's agility where they
can show impressive acrobatic maneuvers, such as parkour. These maneuvers rely
heavily on posture manipulation. To expand the stability and locomotion
plasticity, we use the multi-modal ability in our legged-aerial platform, the
Husky Beta, to perform thruster-assisted walking. This robot has thrusters on
each of its sagittal knee joints which can be used to stabilize its frontal
dynamic as it walks. In this work, we perform a simulation study of quadruped
narrow-path walking with Husky $\beta$, where the robot will utilize its
thrusters to stably walk on a narrow path. The controller is designed based on
a centroidal dynamics model with thruster and foot ground contact forces as
inputs. These inputs are regulated using a QP solver to be used in a model
predictive control framework. In addition to narrow-path walking, we also
perform a lateral push-recovery simulation to study how the thrusters can be
used to stabilize the frontal dynamics.

Abstract: Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet
fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their
configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized,
coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration.
This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized
sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core
operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are
constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial
optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an
optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated
using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution
techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and
gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is
proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved
independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed
method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures
that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion
planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

Result: 在公开和自有数据集上，GSFusion在渲染质量和建图效率上优于现有3DGS SLAM系统。

Conclusion: GSFusion通过多传感器融合和高效优化策略，显著提升了3DGS在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

Abstract: Perception using whisker-inspired tactile sensors currently faces a major
challenge: the lack of active control in robots based on direct contact
information from the whisker. To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is
crucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an
appropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important
for localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp
surfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we
first construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact
and robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms. We develop
a method that leverages a characterized whisker deflection profile to directly
extract the tip contact position using gradient descent, with a Bayesian filter
applied to reduce fluctuations. We then propose an active motion control policy
to maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object
surface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature
and determine the sensor orientation. Results demonstrate that our algorithm
can effectively track objects and reconstruct contours with sub-millimeter
accuracy. Finally, we validate the method in simulations and real-world
experiments where a robot arm drives the whisker sensor to follow the surfaces
of three different objects.

Abstract: A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make
appropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations.
While much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as
trolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as
navigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including
legality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically
rely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations
and can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper
proposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that
operationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The
framework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as
quantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align
with these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and
integrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the
framework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a
real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals
tensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.
The framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning
algorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in
everyday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in
real-world AV deployment.

Abstract: Drifting, characterized by controlled vehicle motion at high sideslip angles,
is crucial for safely handling emergency scenarios at the friction limits.
While recent reinforcement learning approaches show promise for drifting
control, they struggle with the significant simulation-to-reality gap, as
policies that perform well in simulation often fail when transferred to
physical systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework
with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization
that effectively bridges the gap. The proposed approach is validated on both
simulation and a custom-designed and open-sourced 1/10 scale Individual Wheel
Drive (IWD) RC car platform featuring independent wheel speed control.
Experiments across various scenarios from steady-state circular drifting to
direction transitions and variable-curvature path following demonstrate that
our approach achieves precise trajectory tracking while maintaining controlled
sideslip angles throughout complex maneuvers in both simulated and real-world
environments.

Conclusion: 该框架在农业自主导航中具有高效潜力。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在仿真到现实差距较大时失效，需要一种轻量级且可复现的解决方案。

Method: 通过物理引导的增益正则化方案，测量机器人的有效比例增益，并在训练中惩罚神经控制器的局部输入输出灵敏度偏离这些值。同时，控制器根据当前设备参数进行条件化。

Result: 在带有高齿轮比的平衡机器人上，该方法实现了仿真与硬件中角稳定时间的匹配，而纯域随机化策略则表现出持续振荡和较大差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为缩小仿真到现实差距提供了一种轻量级且可复现的框架。

Abstract: Simulation-to-real transfer using domain randomization for robot control
often relies on low-gear-ratio, backdrivable actuators, but these approaches
break down when the sim-to-real gap widens. Inspired by the traditional PID
controller, we reinterpret its gains as surrogates for complex, unmodeled plant
dynamics. We then introduce a physics-guided gain regularization scheme that
measures a robot's effective proportional gains via simple real-world
experiments. Then, we penalize any deviation of a neural controller's local
input-output sensitivities from these values during training. To avoid the
overly conservative bias of naive domain randomization, we also condition the
controller on the current plant parameters. On an off-the-shelf two-wheeled
balancing robot with a 110:1 gearbox, our gain-regularized,
parameter-conditioned RNN achieves angular settling times in hardware that
closely match simulation. At the same time, a purely domain-randomized policy
exhibits persistent oscillations and a substantial sim-to-real gap. These
results demonstrate a lightweight, reproducible framework for closing
sim-to-real gaps on affordable robotic hardware.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: H-RDT利用人类操作数据增强机器人操作能力，通过两阶段训练（预训练和跨具身微调）显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人模仿学习面临高质量数据稀缺问题，跨具身数据训练存在形态多样性挑战。

Method: 采用扩散变换器架构，两阶段训练：预训练人类数据，微调机器人数据。

Result: 在仿真和现实实验中分别提升13.9%和40.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 人类数据可作为学习机器人操作策略的强大基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Conclusion: 语言增强的认知框架有望提升自动驾驶的安全性、可解释性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified
Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion
(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.
The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks
for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous
driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会机器人需根据用户状态调整行为，准确评估用户体验（UX）是实现这一目标的关键。现有方法多关注单一维度，本研究旨在提供更全面的UX评估。

Method: 构建UX数据集，开发基于Transformer的模型，结合面部表情和语音信号，利用多重实例学习框架捕捉短期和长期交互模式。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在UX估计上优于第三方人工评估。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态方法能更全面地捕捉用户体验的动态变化，优于传统方法。

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX
estimation.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大型语言模型在机器人任务规划中的表现，发现其在简单任务中表现良好，但在复杂场景中仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在生成结构化、可执行机器人任务规划中的有效性。

Method: 通过直接使用Planning Domain Definition Language文件提示多种先进语言模型，并与Fast Downward规划器在多个基准上进行比较。

Result: 模型在简单任务中表现良好，但在需要精确资源管理、状态跟踪和约束遵守的复杂场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 未来研究应结合语言模型与传统规划器，以提高机器人规划的可靠性和扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their
potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong
generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and
executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation
of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly
prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,
and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a
variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how
faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can
actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these
models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on
simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios
that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict
constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in
applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By
outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future
research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with
classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of
planning in autonomous robotics.

Conclusion: 该框架适用于具有闭环运动学和最小传感的外骨骼设计，为高保真远程操作和示范学习应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and
immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains
a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning
inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade
tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a
subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that
uses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to
estimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our
method improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with
varying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically
tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more
accurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results
from seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking
errors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative
visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in
motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs
with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for
high-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.

Abstract: We present DRACo-SLAM2, a distributed SLAM framework for underwater robot
teams equipped with multibeam imaging sonar. This framework improves upon the
original DRACo-SLAM by introducing a novel representation of sonar maps as
object graphs and utilizing object graph matching to achieve time-efficient
inter-robot loop closure detection without relying on prior geometric
information. To better-accommodate the needs and characteristics of underwater
scan matching, we propose incremental Group-wise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (GCM), a modification of Pairwise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (PCM), which effectively handles scenarios where nearby
inter-robot loop closures share similar registration errors. The proposed
approach is validated through extensive comparative analyses on simulated and
real-world datasets.

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization serves as a critical component in autonomous
systems, yet existing approaches face persistent challenges in balancing
repeatability, accuracy, and environmental adaptability. Traditional point
cloud registration methods relying solely on offline maps often exhibit limited
robustness against long-term environmental changes, leading to localization
drift and reliability degradation in dynamic real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes DuLoc, a robust and accurate localization
method that tightly couples LiDAR-inertial odometry with offline map-based
localization, incorporating a constant-velocity motion model to mitigate
outlier noise in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we develop a LiDAR-based
localization framework that seamlessly integrates a prior global map with
dynamic real-time local maps, enabling robust localization in unbounded and
changing environments. Extensive real-world experiments in ultra unbounded port
that involve 2,856 hours of operational data across 32 Intelligent Guided
Vehicles (IGVs) are conducted and reported in this study. The results attained
demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art LiDAR
localization systems in large-scale changing outdoor environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity in SLAM
applications due to its fast rendering and high-fidelity representation.
However, existing 3DGS-SLAM systems have predominantly focused on indoor
environments and relied on active depth sensors, leaving a gap for large-scale
outdoor applications. We present BGS-SLAM, the first binocular 3D Gaussian
Splatting SLAM system designed for outdoor scenarios. Our approach uses only
RGB stereo pairs without requiring LiDAR or active sensors. BGS-SLAM leverages
depth estimates from pre-trained deep stereo networks to guide 3D Gaussian

and visual quality. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that BGS-SLAM
achieves superior tracking accuracy and mapping performance compared to other

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for
learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and
generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the
incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change
between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X,
a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent
action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our
approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are
incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable
villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including
SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper
and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds
significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for
future research.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language
modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A
primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or
environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors
across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this
challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can
achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore
RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction
capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL
representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a
unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome
the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task
synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale
multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework
to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction
success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial
reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our
findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated
environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for
significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

Motivation: 蟑螂通过触角提取丰富的触觉信息，但现有传感器技术难以在昆虫尺度机器人中实现类似功能。

Method: 设计了一种多段柔性层压传感器CITRAS，嵌入电容角度传感器，实现轻量化、低功耗和高精度触觉感知。

Result: CITRAS在静态和动态弯曲中的最大误差分别为0.79度和3.58度，并能预测距离、估计间隙宽度和区分表面纹理。

Conclusion: CITRAS为昆虫尺度机器人提供了多功能触觉感知能力，有望提升其在复杂环境中的自主探索和避障能力。

Abstract: The American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) uses its soft antennae to
guide decision making by extracting rich tactile information from tens of
thousands of distributed mechanosensors. Although tactile sensors enable
robust, autonomous perception and navigation in natural systems, replicating
these capabilities in insect-scale robots remains challenging due to stringent
size, weight, and power constraints that limit existing sensor technologies. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CITRAS (Cockroach Inspired Tactile
Robotic Antenna Sensor), a bioinspired, multi-segmented, compliant laminate
sensor with embedded capacitive angle sensors. CITRAS is compact (73.7x15.6x2.1
mm), lightweight (491 mg), and low-power (32 mW), enabling seamless integration
with miniature robotic platforms. The segmented compliant structure passively
bends in response to environmental stimuli, achieving accurate hinge angle
measurements with maximum errors of just 0.79 degree (quasistatic bending) and
3.58 degree (dynamic bending). Experimental evaluations demonstrate CITRAS'
multifunctional tactile perception capabilities: predicting base-to-tip
distances with 7.75 % error, estimating environmental gap widths with 6.73 %
error, and distinguishing surface textures through differential sensor
response. The future integration of this bioinspired tactile antenna in
insect-scale robots addresses critical sensing gaps, promising enhanced
autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping in
complex, confined environments.
