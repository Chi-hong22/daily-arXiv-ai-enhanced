Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture.

Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner.

However, these methods focus on\nreconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization\nexploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a\nnovel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and\ntracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and\nanalysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic\nvolumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate\nsegmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for\ncoarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network\nfor fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results\nwithin the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous\ntracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nVolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Substantive work has been\ndone on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user,\neach shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their\nsatisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate\" functions is then\ndesigned to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines\nthese functions to arrive at the filter $\\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes\nsatisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of\nquerying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$\nof the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is\nto cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score\nvarious cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual\ningredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$\nqueries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe\nthat will maximize this user's satisfaction.

We present VLMgineer, a\nframework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language\nmodels (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design\nphysical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We\nevaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation\nscenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,\nVLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more\neffectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into\nstraightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from\nhuman specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To\nfacilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our\nbenchmark and code.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLMgineer\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u5171\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u521b\u9020\u529b\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u53ca\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "VLMgineer\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "VLMgineer\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that\nmatches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop\nmapping.

One\nof them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data\ndistribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we\npropose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the\ngeneration of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the\nfeature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept\ndrift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new\nconcept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to\navoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a\nstrategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make\nthem more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing\ntime of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly\nremove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing\nconcerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the\nproposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven\nstate-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and\npresented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.\nAdditionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time\nwith a negligible loss in accuracy.

Experimental results show high performance,\nwith 94.5% accuracy, 93.2% precision, and 95.8% recall.

Nevertheless, chart authors with an insufficient\nunderstanding of perceptual theories may encounter difficulties in evaluating\nthe effectiveness of chart representations, thereby struggling to identify the\nappropriate chart design to convey the intended data patterns. To address this\nissue, we propose a perception simulation model that can assess the perceptual\neffectiveness of charts by predicting graphical patterns that chart viewers are\nlikely to notice. The perception simulation model integrates perceptual theory\ninto visual feature extraction of chart elements to provide interpretable model\noutcomes.

To address the\ncomputational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation\nalgorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred\nto as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound\n(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a\ndecision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a\ncontrolling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish\ntheoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical\nexperiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA\nconsistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant\nimprovements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work\nhighlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and\nlarge-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights\nthat can be built upon in future studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6392\u5e8f\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff08KRC\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5KRCA\u548c\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u7b97\u6cd5BnB\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfk\u5747\u503c\u805a\u7c7b\uff08KMC\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u6392\u5e8f\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86KRCA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316KMC\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408BnB\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u6784\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "KRCA\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "KRC\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

To address these challenges\nand defend against personalized voice deepfake threats, we propose Enkidu, a\nnovel user-oriented privacy-preserving framework that leverages universal\nfrequential perturbations generated through black-box knowledge and few-shot\ntraining on a small amount of user data.

Recently, zero-shot\nlearning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object\ndetectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks.

Minimizing the ITAE is a traditional approach\nfor tuning FO controllers. This technique reduces the over/undershoot and\nsuppresses the steady-state error. In contrast to conventional approaches of\nITAE-based controller tuning, the proposed approach does not require multiple\nclosed-loop experiments or model-based simulations to evaluate the ITAE. The\none-shot input/output data is collected from the controlled plant. A fictitious\nreference signal is defined on the basis of the collected input and output\nsignal, which enables us to evaluate the closed-loop response provided by the\narbitrary controller parameters. To avoid repeated experiments that are\nnecessary in the conventional approach, we reformulate the ITAE minimization\nproblem using the fictitious reference signal.

In this paper, we propose a novel visual\nand repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate\nlocalization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured\nby lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we\ndevelop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which\nfeature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based\non the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as\na keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative\nmotion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is\nessentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current\nobservation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the\nfeature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate\nlocalization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our\nqualitative feature flow-motion mapping indicator.

Startup overhead is particularly important in large,\nindustrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams\noperate in iterative update-debug cycles.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the\nexploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping\ncriteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information.

In this work, we show\nthat the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part\ndriven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.\nSpecifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream\nwhich systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled\nreasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction\ncannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes.

However, the inherent risks of eavesdropping and\npacket dropouts in such networks pose significant challenges to secure state\nestimation. In this paper, we address the privacy-preserving fusion estimation\n(PPFE) problem for multi-sensor systems under multiple packet dropouts and\neavesdropping attacks. To mitigate these issues, we propose a distributed\nencoding-based privacy-preserving mechanism (PPM) within a control-theoretic\nframework, ensuring data privacy during transmission while maintaining the\nperformance of legitimate state estimation.

Building on\nan existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving\ndomain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain\nspecifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors\nrelevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to\nidentify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step\ntoward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support\nprincipled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements\nfor camera-based AI perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6574\u5408\u76f8\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4e13\u5bb6\u610f\u89c1\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7eb3\u5165\u5f71\u54cdAI\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u5883\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u6574\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u673a\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0bAI\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u5236\u5b9a\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u76f8\u673a\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0bAI\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates\na long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent\ncost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative\nmethods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,\nin particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)\nmaintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)\nensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to\nenvironments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages\nthe concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients\nof the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed\nmethod in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC\nconsistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times\nclose to the long-horizon MPC baseline.

In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel \"Anchor\nFrame + Animation\" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with\nsmooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a\nImage Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a\nMulti-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and\ntemporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while\npreserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining\nsuperior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability.

Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level\nanatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with\nmorphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in\nUMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state\nspace modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a\nhierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ\ntopological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a\nsnake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),\nwhich leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive\nrefinement of complex morphologies.

While Transformer-based\narchitectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence\nlength hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements\nin State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for\nlong-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and\ntransient dynamics effectively.

In parallel, recent work on\nGradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in\nwhich the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely\nproportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored\nthe underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the\nunderstanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still\nmissing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in\ndetail.

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the\nsame for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when\nassessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5NAMMD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3MMD\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86NAMMD-DCT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8eMMD-DCT\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DCT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u4e00\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002MMD\u867d\u80fd\u8861\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cfNAMMD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RKHS\u8303\u6570\u7f29\u653eMMD\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5176\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NAMMD-DCT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cNAMMD-DCT\u6bd4MMD-DCT\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u68c0\u9a8c\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u7c7b\u578bI\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u63a7\u3002NAMMD\u5728\u4e24\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "NAMMD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684DCT\u548c\u4e24\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eMMD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, person\nidentification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,\nremains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on\nmovement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In\ncontrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals\nfrom Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains\nstationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced\nby the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To\nsupport evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a\ncontrolled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across\nmultiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier\nremoval, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality.

MCoT-RE utilizes\nmulti-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit\nmodifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one\nfocused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual\ncontext. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we\ncombine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained\nre-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning\nwith the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context\nof the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves\nstate-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of\nup to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCoT-RE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672cCIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6587\u672c\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672cCIR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMCoT-RE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728FashionIQ\u548cCIRR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRecall@10\u548cRecall@1\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53476.24%\u548c8.58%\u3002", "conclusion": "MCoT-RE\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672cCIR\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Owing to\nCLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing\ninterest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on\ntask-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting\nin suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,\nwe propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and\nEnsemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the\nattention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain\nshifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated\ntarget domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the\nattention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains.

To address this,\nwe first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding\npolicy ($\\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the\ntraining of the target policy ($\\pion$). This approach improves training\nstability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.\nSecondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are\noften discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these\nsamples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance\nsample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,\ndemonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution\nwithin the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or\nmatches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency\nby 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different\nconditioning mechanisms or complex architectures.

Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative\nnature of diffusion models.

In this paper, we propose a\nDMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise\nPower-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned\nEquivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute\nquantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall\nquantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having\nsmall quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error\naccumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to\nprioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that\nlayers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we\nintroduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are\ngeneralisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be\nexplained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,\nalong with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this\nlearned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these\nuncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may\nbe estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of\ncardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the\nefficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty\nand its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered\npractical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are\navailable at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\uff08MUPM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMUPM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fc3\u810fMR\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "MUPM\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "MUPM\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u56e0\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space.

It\nprogressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically\nguaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,\nrobustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables\nVLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using\nminimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.\nHCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments\ndemonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\uff08HCS\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5e7f\u57df\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u590d\u6742\u5e7f\u57df\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHCS\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u533a\u57df\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6548\u7528\u3001\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u534f\u540c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHCS\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HCS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55VLM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

The absence of ground truths for\nunknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have\naddressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently\nproposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)\nis a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown\nobjects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces\nissues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.\n  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel\nmodel, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of\nObjectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate\nlayers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and\nobjectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query\nInitialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown\nobjects, thereby improving performance.

As AI-generated visual content\nbecomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of\ndetecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,\nensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been\nsubstantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for\nvideo detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human\nfaces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,\ncreating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos\nwith generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated\nvideos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been\ntrained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can\nhelp distinguish real from generated videos.

Approximate orthogonality\nimplies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,\nsignifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability.

Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ\ndatasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and\nconsistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches.

However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio.

To generate data via a flow matching model, an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward\nintegration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality\nthat is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was\nrecently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically\nintegrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the\nmulti-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of\nmodeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model\nmulti-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution\nremains identical across levels of the hierarchy.
