*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed,Pushti Amit Vasoya,Simeon Kandan Sonar,Yasir Z,Madesh Kuppusamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的图像真实性检测系统，结合轻量级卷积分类器和视觉语言模型，能够在32x32低分辨率图像中检测、定位和解释AI生成图像的伪影，准确率达96.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成图像的真实性不断提高，验证视觉真实性面临挑战，需要开发能够检测、定位和解释图像伪影的可解释系统。

Method: 结合轻量级卷积分类器(Faster-Than-Lies)和视觉语言模型(Qwen2-VL-7B)，使用自编码器重建误差图生成伪影定位热图，并将70种视觉伪影类型分为8个语义组。

Result: 在增强的CiFAKE数据集上达到96.5%的准确率，8核CPU上推理时间为175ms，能够生成可解释的文本描述每个检测到的异常。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了结合视觉和语言推理在低分辨率图像中进行可解释真实性检测的可行性，并概述了在取证、工业检测和社交媒体审核等领域的跨领域应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [2] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer是一个基于transformer的类无关物体计数框架，通过识别视觉重复和结构关系来实现类无关计数，在复杂形状和密集场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够通过感知视觉重复和结构关系来轻松计数，而现有计数模型在复杂形状、内部对称或重叠物体时容易出错。

Method: 基于CounTR架构，使用自监督基础模型DINOv2替换视觉编码器，加入位置嵌入融合来保持几何关系，通过轻量卷积解码器生成密度图。

Result: 在FSC-147数据集上达到与当前SOTA方法相当的性能，在结构复杂或密集场景中表现出更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 集成DINOv2等基础模型使计数系统能够接近人类的结构感知能力，推进真正通用且无需示例的计数范式。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

### [3] [A geometric and deep learning reproducible pipeline for monitoring floating anthropogenic debris in urban rivers using in situ cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23798)
*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Clément Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于固定摄像头的深度学习框架，用于河流漂浮垃圾的连续监测和量化，通过几何模型估算物体实际尺寸，验证了低成本自动化监测系统的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 河流中漂浮的人为垃圾对生物多样性、水质和人类活动造成负面影响，需要有效的监测方法。

Method: 使用固定原位摄像头和深度学习模型，结合几何模型从2D图像估算物体实际尺寸，考虑数据泄露偏差和负样本整合。

Result: 验证了在复杂环境条件下深度学习模型的准确性和推理速度，证明了基于投影几何和回归修正的度量物体估算可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为城市水环境开发稳健、低成本的自动化监测系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

### [4] [RareFlow: Physics-Aware Flow-Matching for Cross-Sensor Super-Resolution of Rare-Earth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23816)
*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareFlow是一个面向遥感图像超分辨率的物理感知框架，专门解决分布外条件下的鲁棒性问题，通过双条件架构和不确定性量化来避免特征幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像超分辨率在分布外条件下（如不同传感器捕获的罕见地貌特征）经常失败，产生视觉合理但物理不准确的结果。

Method: 采用双条件架构：门控ControlNet保持低分辨率输入的几何保真度，文本提示提供语义指导；引入多面损失函数确保光谱和辐射一致性；通过随机前向传播量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在盲评估中，地球物理专家认为模型输出接近地面真实图像的质量，显著优于最先进基线；感知指标定量增益显著，FID降低近40%。

Conclusion: RareFlow为数据稀缺科学领域提供了高保真合成的鲁棒框架，并为严重域偏移下的受控生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

### [5] [TRELLISWorld: Training-Free World Generation from Object Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23880)
*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的3D场景生成方法，通过将通用文本到3D对象扩散模型重新用作模块化瓦片生成器，将场景生成重新定义为多瓦片去噪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于单对象生成、需要领域特定训练或缺乏360度全景支持，需要一种更通用的3D场景生成方法。

Method: 将场景生成重新定义为多瓦片去噪问题，独立生成重叠的3D区域并通过加权平均无缝融合，利用对象级扩散模型作为模块化瓦片生成器。

Result: 该方法支持多样化的场景布局、高效生成和灵活编辑，能够合成大规模连贯场景同时保持局部语义控制。

Conclusion: 建立了一个简单而强大的基础，用于通用语言驱动的3D场景构建，无需场景级数据集或重新训练。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [6] [Fast and accurate neural reflectance transformation imaging through knowledge distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24486)
*Tinsae G. Dulecha,Leonardo Righetto,Ruggero Pintus,Enrico Gobbetti,Andrea Giachetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DisK-NeuralRTI方法，通过知识蒸馏降低NeuralRTI的计算成本，解决其在有限硬件上无法全分辨率渲染的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RTI方法如PTM和HSH在复杂反射场下存在伪影问题，NeuralRTI虽质量更好但计算成本高，无法在有限硬件上实现全分辨率交互式重光照。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，训练小型学生网络来模拟大型教师网络（NeuralRTI）的行为，从而降低计算复杂度。

Result: DisK-NeuralRTI在保持NeuralRTI高质量的同时，显著降低了计算成本，使得在有限硬件上实现全分辨率交互式重光照成为可能。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是降低NeuralRTI计算成本的有效方法，DisK-NeuralRTI在质量和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

### [7] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LHT-CLIP是一个无需训练的框架，通过利用CLIP在层、头和令牌级别的视觉区分性来改进语义分割性能，无需额外训练或超参数调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CLIP模型的图像级预训练目标与密集预测所需的像素级视觉理解之间存在不匹配，现有方法继承了前几层的全局对齐偏差，导致分割性能不佳。

Method: 提出三种互补技术：语义空间重加权、选择性头增强和异常令牌替换，系统性地恢复CLIP的视觉区分性。

Result: 在8个常见语义分割基准测试中，LHT-CLIP实现了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性和实际部署的实用性。

Conclusion: LHT-CLIP通过利用CLIP内在的视觉区分性，无需额外训练即可显著提升语义分割性能，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

### [8] [DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907)
*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride是一个无需手动场景分割的管道，通过自适应帧采样和多模态窗口技术生成连贯的场景级视频字幕，在YouCookII数据集上优于VLLaMA3和GPT-4o等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教学视频中的场景级字幕需要理解视觉线索和时间结构，但现有字幕缺乏连贯性会影响教育效果，因此需要开发能自动生成高质量场景字幕的方法。

Method: 使用自适应帧采样和多模态窗口捕捉关键场景转换，采用多模态思维链生成动作-对象对，通过动态步长窗口选择算法平衡时间上下文和冗余，最终生成融合视觉语义和时间推理的教学字幕。

Result: 在N-gram指标（BLEU、METEOR）和语义相似度指标（BERTScore、CLIPScore）上均优于基线模型，定性分析显示生成的字幕在时间连贯性和信息量方面表现更好。

Conclusion: DynaStride为改进AI驱动的教学内容生成提供了一个有前景的方向，能够产生更连贯、信息丰富的场景级字幕。

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

### [9] [TurboPortrait3D: Single-step diffusion-based fast portrait novel-view synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23929)
*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D是一种低延迟的人像新视角合成方法，通过结合图像到3D模型和扩散模型来提升3D人像生成质量，同时保持3D感知和运行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人像图像到3D模型存在视觉伪影、细节缺失和身份保持不足的问题，而图像扩散模型虽然质量高但计算昂贵且缺乏3D一致性。

Method: 采用前馈图像到化身生成管道获取初始3D表示和噪声渲染，然后使用单步扩散模型在输入图像条件下进行多视角一致的精炼，结合合成多视图数据预训练和高质量真实图像微调。

Result: 该方法在定性和定量上均优于当前最先进的人像新视角合成方法，同时保持时间效率。

Conclusion: TurboPortrait3D成功展示了如何利用图像空间扩散模型显著提升现有图像到化身方法的质量，同时保持3D感知和低延迟运行。

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

### [10] [PlanarGS: High-Fidelity Indoor 3D Gaussian Splatting Guided by Vision-Language Planar Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23930)
*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS通过引入语言提示平面先验和几何监督，解决了3D高斯泼溅在室内大平面低纹理场景中的几何模糊问题，显著提升了3D表面重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅在室内大平面低纹理场景中，仅依赖光度损失会导致几何模糊，无法重建高保真3D表面。

Method: 提出语言提示平面先验(LP3)管道，使用预训练视觉语言分割模型并通过跨视图融合和几何先验检查来优化区域建议；在3D高斯优化中加入平面先验监督和几何先验监督两个额外项。

Result: 在标准室内基准测试中，PlanarGS重建出准确详细的3D表面，大幅优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PlanarGS通过结合平面和几何先验，有效解决了室内场景中3D高斯泼溅的几何重建问题，实现了高质量的3D表面重建。

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

### [11] [Adaptive Training of INRs via Pruning and Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23943)
*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe是一种自适应训练方案，通过神经元剪枝和输入频率密集化来优化隐式神经表示，在减少模型大小的同时保持或提高重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐式神经表示中频率选择和架构优化的问题，避免参数冗余并提高表示能力。

Method: 使用神经元剪枝机制识别并移除贡献较小的神经元，通过输入频率密集化在信号欠拟合的频谱区域添加频率。

Result: 在图像和SDF上的实验表明，AIRe能够减少模型大小同时保持或提高重建质量。

Conclusion: AIRe提供了一种改进的网络大小与重建质量之间的权衡方案，代码和预训练模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

### [12] [Neural USD: An object-centric framework for iterative editing and control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23956)
*Alejandro Escontrela,Shrinu Kushagra,Sjoerd van Steenkiste,Yulia Rubanova,Aleksander Holynski,Kelsey Allen,Kevin Murphy,Thomas Kipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Neural USD框架，通过结构化、层次化的场景表示方法，解决了生成式模型中精确迭代对象编辑的挑战，实现了对单个对象外观、几何和姿态的独立控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控生成模型在精确迭代对象编辑方面存在挑战，改变条件信号往往导致场景的全局变化，无法实现特定对象的精确编辑。

Method: 借鉴计算机图形学中的USD标准，提出Neural USD框架，采用结构化层次化场景表示，结合微调方法确保控制信号的解耦。

Result: 该框架能够实现迭代和增量式工作流程，支持对场景中单个对象的独立控制，避免了全局变化问题。

Conclusion: Neural USD为生成式模型中的精确对象编辑提供了有效的解决方案，通过结构化表示实现了更好的控制能力。

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision是一种新型图像护栏系统，通过整合类人推理来增强适应性和透明度，无需重新训练即可动态适应不断发展的安全策略，在多个基准测试中表现优于GPT-4o且速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像护栏模型受限于预定义类别，缺乏语义推理导致误分类，且难以适应新兴威胁，需要昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 采用有效的数据收集和生成框架、策略遵循训练流程、定制损失函数，以及多样化的问答生成和训练策略来增强学习效果。

Result: SafeVision在VisionHarm-T上比GPT-4o表现优8.6%，在VisionHarm-C上优15.5%，同时速度快16倍以上。

Conclusion: SafeVision建立了全面、策略遵循且可解释的图像护栏，能够动态适应新兴威胁。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估AI助手的能力，缺乏真实的流式场景，或仅支持短期任务。需要开发一个更全面、真实的评估框架来推动实用AI助手的发展。

Method: 构建包含同步多模态数据（视频、音频、文本）的数据集，数据对齐在统一时间轴上，并通过人工精炼获得高质量视觉叙述和语音转录。定义12个子任务评估三个核心能力：记忆、理解和跨记忆推理。

Result: TeleEgo包含3,291个人工验证的QA项目，涵盖多种问题格式（单选、二元、多选和开放式）。提出了实时准确性和记忆持久时间两个关键指标来联合评估正确性、时间响应性和长期记忆保持。

Conclusion: TeleEgo提供了一个现实且全面的评估框架，能够推动实用AI助手的发展，特别是在长时记忆、实时响应和多模态理解方面的能力。

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

Conclusion: AdvBlur方法通过对抗性模糊和双损失函数有效提升了糖尿病视网膜病变分类模型的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed
tomography angiography (CTA) holds immense clinical potential, but its
development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We
launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing
a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation.
The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with
subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our
findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D
U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an
ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed
individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was
strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized
post-processing steps, and the characteristics of the training data. This
initiative not only establishes a new performance benchmark but also provides a

Motivation: 火星科学领域缺乏像其他领域那样的标准化基准测试和评估框架，这限制了火星基础模型的发展。

Method: 构建包含20个数据集的Mars-Bench基准测试，涵盖轨道和表面图像，专注于关键地质特征如陨石坑、锥体、巨石和霜冻，并提供标准化数据集和基线评估。

Result: 所有分析结果表明，火星特定基础模型可能比通用领域模型具有优势，这激励了领域自适应预训练的进一步探索。

Conclusion: Mars-Bench旨在为火星科学机器学习模型的开发和比较建立标准化基础，推动火星基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型的安全机制容易受到对抗性提示攻击，现有的红队方法需要白盒访问且效率低下，生成的提示语义无意义且容易被过滤器拦截。

Method: 采用交替优化-微调管道，结合对抗性后缀优化和LLM微调；在优化阶段集成双重规避策略，通过辅助LLM困惑度评分和禁止词惩罚来绕过基于困惑度的过滤器和黑名单词过滤器。

Result: 实验表明该方法在红队测试中表现优异，生成的人类可读对抗性提示能够有效抵抗过滤器，并具有卓越的零样本迁移能力，能够适应未见过的提示并暴露商业API的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: APT框架能够有效生成人类可读、抗过滤的对抗性提示，为评估文本到图像模型的安全性提供了高效的黑盒解决方案。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

Conclusion: 残差网络通过跳跃连接有效解决了深度网络训练难题，显著提升了深度神经网络的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient
problem. This paper explores Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et
al. (2015), which overcomes this limitation by using skip connections. ResNet
enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.

TL;DR: SNELLA是一种单阶段的参数高效微调方法，通过非线性核函数扩展低秩分解和自适应双层稀疏分配机制，在减少内存使用的同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有稀疏微调方法的两阶段范式问题：第一阶段基于梯度信息定位任务相关权重，忽略了微调过程中的参数调整；第二阶段仅更新定位的权重，导致高内存使用。

Method: 提出单阶段方法SNELLA：1）通过两个低秩可学习矩阵合并的稀疏矩阵选择性更新权重矩阵，引入非线性核函数防止权重更新间的相互依赖；2）设计自适应双层稀疏分配机制，基于重要性分数在层间和层内进行端到端的权重竞争。

Result: 在分类、分割和生成任务上的实验显示，SNELLA在低内存使用下达到SOTA性能：在FGVC基准上比SPT-LoRA提高1.8%的Top-1准确率（91.9% vs 90.1%）；相比之前方法，在86M到632M参数规模的模型上实现31.1%-39.9%的内存减少。

Conclusion: SNELLA通过创新的单阶段设计和自适应稀疏分配机制，有效解决了现有PEFT方法在性能和内存效率方面的限制，为参数高效微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

TL;DR: 提出COLA框架，通过最优传输理论解决CLIP模型在对抗攻击下的跨模态特征对齐问题，无需训练即可显著提升零样本分类的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注对抗微调或提示优化，但忽视了CLIP编码特征中文本和图像特征之间的对齐差距，这种不对齐在对抗扰动下会被显著放大，导致分类性能严重下降。

Method: COLA框架包含两个步骤：(1)将对抗图像嵌入投影到类文本特征张成的子空间，过滤非语义失真；(2)将图像和文本建模为多增强视图上的离散分布，通过最优传输优化对齐，并将子空间投影无缝集成到成本计算中。

Result: 在14个零样本分类基准上的广泛评估显示COLA的有效性，在ImageNet及其变体上对抗PGD攻击时平均提升6.7%，同时在干净样本上保持高准确率。

Conclusion: COLA是一个无需训练且与现有微调模型兼容的框架，通过恢复特征空间的全局图像-文本对齐和局部结构一致性，有效解决对抗性不对齐问题。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

TL;DR: 提出BOB微调策略，通过提取类无关属性（如背景和姿态）并在微调和生成时分别条件化和边缘化处理，缓解T2I模型在少样本细粒度分类中的过拟合问题，提升合成数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型用于合成数据集生成时，用少量真实样本微调可提升质量但易导致过拟合和多样性降低，特别是在细粒度分类任务中。

Method: 从少量真实样本中提取类无关属性，在微调T2I模型时显式条件化这些属性，在生成时边缘化它们，以减少过拟合并保持生成先验。

Result: 在多个T2I模型、骨干网络和数据集上，BOB在少样本细粒度分类中达到SOTA性能，在Aircraft数据集上比DataDream提升7.4%，在18/24实验设置中优于先前方法。

Conclusion: BOB方法有效缓解了T2I模型微调时的过拟合问题，提升了合成数据在少样本细粒度分类中的有效性，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉模型在广泛应用中需要同时具备高分类能力和可解释性，但目前不清楚这两者是否能同时实现。

Method: 提出IIS评分，通过衡量解释过程中信息损失来量化表示的可解释性，评估不同分类能力下表示的可解释性。

Result: 发现可解释性与分类能力呈正相关，高分类能力的表示包含更多可解释语义，通过可解释性最大化微调可进一步提升分类能力。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉模型可以统一提升可解释性和分类能力，为实际应用提供了理论基础和方法支持。

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了统一异构知识蒸馏（UHKD）框架，通过在频域利用中间特征来解决异构模型间的语义差异问题，实现跨架构知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要针对同构模型设计，在异构场景下性能下降，特别是涉及中间特征时。架构多样性导致语义差异，限制了中间表示的使用。

Method: 使用傅里叶变换捕捉全局特征信息，缓解异构师生对间的表示差异。包含特征转换模块（FTM）生成紧凑的频域表示，以及可学习的特征对齐模块（FAM）进行多级匹配对齐。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K数据集上分别取得了5.59%和0.83%的性能提升，优于最新方法。

Conclusion: UHKD是统一异构表示并有效利用视觉知识的有效方法，为异构模型间的知识蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

Method: 提出三阶段实例特定优化流程：粗对齐、密集对应监督和时间正则化，将SMAL模型拟合到运动序列。

Result: 建立了四个运动恢复基准设置，支持单目/多视角、RGB/RGB-D输入的系统评估。

Conclusion: DogMo数据集和方法为狗运动恢复研究提供了基础，开启了计算机视觉、图形学和动物行为建模交叉领域的新方向。

Abstract: We present DogMo, a large-scale multi-view RGB-D video dataset capturing
diverse canine movements for the task of motion recovery from images. DogMo
comprises 1.2k motion sequences collected from 10 unique dogs, offering rich
variation in both motion and breed. It addresses key limitations of existing
dog motion datasets, including the lack of multi-view and real 3D data, as well
as limited scale and diversity. Leveraging DogMo, we establish four motion
recovery benchmark settings that support systematic evaluation across monocular
and multi-view, RGB and RGB-D inputs. To facilitate accurate motion recovery,
we further introduce a three-stage, instance-specific optimization pipeline
that fits the SMAL model to the motion sequences. Our method progressively
refines body shape and pose through coarse alignment, dense correspondence
supervision, and temporal regularization. Our dataset and method provide a
principled foundation for advancing research in dog motion recovery and open up
new directions at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and
animal behavior modeling.

TL;DR: 提出ETC框架，通过趋势一致性预测和模型特定误差容忍度搜索，在保持生成质量的同时实现2.65倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型迭代采样成本高，现有训练免费方法忽略去噪趋势且缺乏误差控制，导致轨迹偏差和结果不一致

Method: 引入一致趋势预测器利用扩散轨迹平滑连续性，提出模型特定误差容忍度搜索机制

Result: 在FLUX上实现2.65倍加速，一致性退化可忽略(-0.074 SSIM)

Conclusion: ETC框架有效解决了扩散模型加速中的轨迹偏差问题，实现了高质量加速

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架有效提升了文本到图像生成的布局忠实度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role
of high-quality video-text pairs in training models capable of producing

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured
prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on
safety-critical autonomous driving tasks. Code and prompt are available at

Motivation: SAM2作为SAM的继任者，在视频分割方面表现出强大的泛化能力，但其鲁棒性尚未被探索。现有对SAM的攻击是否能直接迁移到SAM2尚不清楚，且两者架构差异带来了新的挑战。

Method: 设计了目标扫描策略将每帧分为k个区域并随机分配提示，减少优化过程中的提示依赖；提出双重语义偏差框架，通过扭曲当前帧语义和破坏连续帧间语义一致性来优化UAP。

Result: 在6个数据集上的两个分割任务实验表明，UAP-SAM2显著优于现有最先进攻击方法。

Conclusion: UAP-SAM2是首个针对SAM2的有效跨提示通用对抗攻击方法，成功解决了由架构差异带来的挑战，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical
structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing
efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical
diagnostic scenarios. Project page is available at

Motivation: 自回归视觉生成模型因逐token生成的推理速度过慢而受限，需要数千步才能生成单个样本，这严重影响了实际应用。

Method: 提出MC-SJD方法，基于耦合理论的信息论方法，通过最大化连续迭代中采样相同草稿token的概率来加速标准SJD，同时保持无损特性。该方法仅需对现有算法进行单行修改。

Conclusion: MC-SJD通过简单的算法修改显著提升了自回归视觉生成的推理速度，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Result: 在视觉质量、身份抑制和效用保持方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: ID²Face提供了一种有效的训练中心匿名化解决方案，实现了更好的身份保护和非身份属性保持

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

Conclusion: SCOPE方法通过联合考虑显著性和覆盖率，能更好地保持语义完整性，同时减少计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The
dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出Lipschitz正则化目标检测(LROD)框架，通过将图像恢复直接集成到检测器特征学习中，解决恢复网络与检测网络之间的功能不匹配问题，提高在恶劣条件下的检测稳定性。

Conclusion: LROD框架通过协调恢复和检测任务的Lipschitz连续性，有效解决了传统级联框架中的功能不匹配问题，显著提升了在恶劣条件下的目标检测性能。

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

Result: 在公共基准测试上，DeshadowMamba实现了最先进的视觉质量和强大的定量性能。

Conclusion: 通过将序列建模适应阴影去除的结构完整性和色彩一致性要求，该方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强方法主要关注数据的内在属性（如保真度和多样性），而忽略了任务特定需求，但不同任务和网络架构的训练数据需求差异很大

Method: 引入权重分配网络评估合成样本的任务特定效用，采用双层优化策略：模型级优化针对下游任务定制生成模型，实例级优化在每轮生成中调整生成策略（如提示嵌入和初始噪声）

Conclusion: UtilGen生成更具影响力和任务相关性的合成数据，验证了从视觉特征中心到任务效用中心的数据增强范式转变的有效性

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

TL;DR: 提出ViPER框架，通过两阶段任务和自举式训练解决VLMs的细粒度视觉感知瓶颈，在保持通用性的同时显著提升感知能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在细粒度视觉感知方面的能力有限，这成为实际应用的关键瓶颈。现有方法存在缺陷：监督微调会损害通用能力，而强化微调则偏向文本推理而非视觉感知

Method: 提出两阶段任务将视觉感知学习构建为从粗到细的渐进过程，开发ViPER自举框架，通过自批判和自预测实现迭代进化，整合图像级和实例级重建与两阶段强化学习策略

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL模型上应用ViPER产生Qwen-Viper系列，在7个综合基准上平均提升1.7%，在细粒度感知任务上提升高达6.0%，在不同视觉语言场景中均表现优异

Conclusion: ViPER不仅实现了感知能力的自我提升，还为生成与理解之间的互惠关系提供了具体证据，是开发更自主、更强大VLMs的突破性进展

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference
implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including
GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感应用依赖深度学习进行场景分类，但面临标注数据稀缺和跨域标注成本高的问题。虽然视觉语言模型如CLIP通过对齐视觉和文本模态学习可迁移表示，但直接应用于遥感领域存在显著域差距和任务特定语义适配需求。

Method: 系统评估了多种提示学习方法：上下文优化、条件上下文优化、多模态提示学习、带自调节约束的提示。这些方法反映了互补的设计理念，从静态上下文优化到条件提示增强泛化，多模态提示联合视觉语言适配，语义正则化提示实现稳定学习而不遗忘。

Result: 在多个基准遥感数据集上的广泛实验表明，提示学习在少样本场景中持续优于两个标准基线：使用手工提示的零样本CLIP和在冻结CLIP特征上训练的线性探针。带自调节约束的提示方法实现了最稳健的跨域性能。

Conclusion: 提示学习是弥合卫星和航空图像域差距的可扩展高效解决方案，为该领域未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in

Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image

TL;DR: W2-Net通过双查询机制将引用表达式计数问题解耦为'计数什么'和'查看哪里'，引入专门的where-to-see查询来提取属性特定区域的特征，并提出了子类可分离匹配策略来增强子类间区分度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的引用表达式计数方法存在一个被忽视的根本挑战：标注点通常放置在类别代表性位置（如头部），迫使模型关注类别级特征而忽略其他视觉区域（如腿部）的属性信息。

Method: 提出W2-Net框架，使用双查询机制：what-to-count查询定位对象，where-to-see查询专门从属性特定视觉区域提取特征。还引入了子类可分离匹配策略，通过排斥力增强标签分配时的子类间可分离性。

Result: 在REC-8K数据集上显著优于现有最先进方法，计数误差分别降低了22.5%（验证集）和18.0%（测试集），定位F1分数分别提高了7%和8%。

Conclusion: W2-Net通过明确解耦'计数什么'和'查看哪里'，有效解决了引用表达式计数中的属性信息利用不足问题，在计数精度和定位性能上均取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to
the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual
expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A
fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are
typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing
models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information
from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we
propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into
"what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically,
alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we
introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to
seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling
precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable
Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force
to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing
counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving
localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.

Conclusion: 高性能研究流水线可以成功转化为便携、临床可用的工具，证明了框架的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种亮度感知多尺度网络(MLSN)用于偏振图像融合，通过动态亮度加权、全局-局部特征融合和亮度增强模块，解决了偏振图像在复杂光照环境下的对比度差异问题。


<details>

Motivation: 偏振图像融合结合S0和DOLP图像，通过互补的纹理特征揭示表面粗糙度和材料特性，在伪装识别、组织病理分析、表面缺陷检测等领域有重要应用。需要解决复杂光照环境下不同偏振图像间固有对比度差异的问题。

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,

TL;DR: 系统研究放射学报告在医学图像分类训练中的使用时机和方式，发现报告在预训练和微调阶段的作用取决于标签与文本的关联程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像通常伴随包含丰富专家注释的放射学报告，但依赖这些报告作为临床预测输入需要放射科医生的及时人工工作。研究旨在确定何时以及如何利用放射学报告来改进仅基于图像的分类。

Method: 在预训练和微调阶段系统研究放射学报告的使用，涵盖诊断和预后任务，并在不同训练集规模下进行实验。比较图像-文本对齐预训练与仅图像预训练的效果。

Result: 1) 当标签在文本中充分体现时，预训练阶段利用报告有益；但当标签与文本关联较弱时，通过显式图像-文本对齐进行预训练可能有害。2) 在微调阶段使用报告可以带来显著改进，在某些情况下比预训练方法影响更大。

Conclusion: 研究为如何利用特权文本数据训练医学图像分类器提供了可操作的见解，同时指出了当前研究中的空白。报告的使用效果取决于下游任务中标签与文本的关联程度。

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风后MRI不仅显示局灶性病变，还显示继发性结构变化，如萎缩和脑室扩大。这些异常作为恢复和结果的成像生物标志物越来越受重视，但监督分割方法难以有效捕捉。

Method: 使用REFLECT流生成模型进行无监督异常检测。在ATLAS数据上使用双专家中心切片标注，通过Free-Response ROC分析评估异常图性能。训练了两个模型：一个使用无病灶中风患者切片，另一个使用健康对照数据。

Result: 在ATLAS测试对象上，使用健康对照数据训练的模型在病变分割方面表现更好（Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27），对非病灶性异常的敏感性也更高（FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43）。

Conclusion: 在完全健康的解剖结构上训练可以改善正常变异性的建模，从而能够更广泛、更可靠地检测结构异常。

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

*Ali Ahmad Faour,Nabil Amacha,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于开源卫星影像和机器学习的无传感器方法，用于实时监测黎巴嫩Qaraaoun水库的蓄水量，解决了传统传感器易故障和维护困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Qaraaoun水库作为黎巴嫩最大的地表水体，其可持续管理依赖于可靠的蓄水量监测，但传统传感器经常故障且维护能力有限，需要开发不依赖地面测量的替代方案。

Method: 集成Sentinel-2和Landsat卫星影像，使用新提出的水体分割指数进行水面提取，基于支持向量回归(SVR)的机器学习模型，仅依赖卫星影像提取的水面面积来估算水库体积。

Result: 水体分割精度超过95%，经超参数调优的SVR模型误差低于水库总容量的1.5%，决定系数超过0.98，证明了方法的鲁棒性和成本效益。

Conclusion: 该方法为水库蓄水量连续监测提供了实用的传感器独立解决方案，可复制应用于其他水体，生成的50年时间序列数据对气候变化和环境模式研究具有重要价值。

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the
resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate
change and environmental patterns.

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门用于评估语义分割中可解释AI方法的系统框架，考虑了空间和上下文任务复杂性，使用像素级评估策略和精心设计的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在安全关键领域的应用增加，确保模型透明度和可信度至关重要。虽然分类任务中的XAI评估已有进展，但语义分割的评估策略相对缺乏。

Method: 开发了针对语义分割的全面系统评估框架，采用像素级评估策略和专门设计的指标，使用基于类激活映射的XAI方案进行模拟验证。

Result: 模拟结果显示所提方法具有高效性、鲁棒性和可靠性，能够提供细粒度的可解释性洞察。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推进透明、可信和可问责的语义分割模型发展，为XAI在语义分割领域的评估提供了系统解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

*Zhineng Zhao,Zhihai He,Zikun Zhou,Siwei Ma,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DCIC-sgp框架，通过自生成先验进行深度条件化，有效分离图像的结构信息和细节信息，在低码率下显著减少几何变形伪影，在多个数据集上相比VVC实现显著BD-rate降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型图像压缩方法难以建模自然图像中复杂的相关性结构，特别是全局结构与局部纹理的纠缠，导致低码率下出现严重几何变形。

Method: 使用功能分解框架，首先编码自生成先验来捕捉图像结构骨架，然后用该先验深度调制整个压缩流程，特别是分析变换，使其专注于残差的高熵细节。

Result: 视觉分析显示显著减轻了低码率下的几何变形伪影；在Kodak、CLIC和Tecnick数据集上相比VTM-12.1分别实现14.4%、15.7%和15.1%的BD-rate降低。

Conclusion: 通过深度条件化和层次化依赖驱动的方法，实现了信息流的有效分离，在保持竞争性能的同时显著改善了低码率压缩质量。

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

TL;DR: 视频扩散模型(VDMs)在视觉任务中比大语言模型(LLMs)表现出更高的数据效率，视频预训练为视觉基础模型提供了有益的归纳偏置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在语言领域表现出色，但在视觉领域仍面临组合理解、样本效率和通用问题解决等挑战，需要探索新的预训练方法

Method: 使用预训练的视频扩散模型(VDMs)和大语言模型(LLMs)，配备轻量级适配器，在包括ARC-AGI、ConceptARC、视觉游戏、路径规划和元胞自动机等多个基准上进行对比评估

Result: 在多个视觉任务基准测试中，视频扩散模型比语言模型表现出更高的数据效率

Conclusion: 视频预训练提供了支持视觉基础模型发展的有益归纳偏置，是解决视觉领域挑战的有前景方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

*Charles Javerliat,Pierre Raimbaud,Guillaume Lavoué*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kineo是一个完全自动化的无标定多视角运动捕捉系统，可从非同步、未标定的消费级RGB相机视频中重建3D关键点和密集场景点云，无需精确相机标定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无标定方法虽然降低了相机标定的要求，但存在计算成本高和重建精度低的问题，限制了非专业用户和野外捕捉的可用性。

Method: 利用现成的2D关键点检测器同时标定相机（包括布朗-康拉迪畸变系数）并重建3D关键点和密集场景点云。采用置信度驱动的时空关键点采样策略和基于图的全局优化，确保鲁棒标定且计算成本与序列长度无关。

Result: 在EgoHumans和Human3.6M数据集上评估显示，相比现有无标定方法，相机平移误差降低83-85%，相机角度误差降低86-92%，世界平均关节误差降低83-91%。

Conclusion: Kineo在真实场景中高效，能够比视频时长更快地处理多视角序列，并提供了成对重投影一致性评分来量化3D重建可靠性，促进实际应用。

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Decoupled MeanFlow方法，将预训练的流模型转换为流映射模型，无需架构修改，实现1-4步高质量图像生成，在ImageNet上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型（如扩散模型和流模型）需要大量去噪步骤，采样速度慢。流映射可以减少离散化误差并加速采样，但通常需要架构修改，与预训练模型不兼容。

Method: 引入解耦均值流方法，通过条件化扩散变换器的最终块到后续时间步，将预训练流模型直接重新用作流映射。结合增强训练技术，实现1-4步高质量生成。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512上，1步FID分别为2.16和2.12，4步FID分别为1.51和1.68，超过现有方法，推理速度提升100倍以上。

Conclusion: 训练流模型后转换为流映射比从头训练流映射更高效有效，该方法实现了高质量快速生成，几乎匹配流模型性能但大幅提升推理速度。

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉理解方面表现出色，但在需要视觉规划和想象的复杂场景中表现不佳。受人类使用草图进行视觉思维的启发，希望为模型提供类似的视觉思考工具。

Method: 在现有MLLMs基础上集成视觉生成功能，包括两个组件：上下文感知视觉头自回归生成视觉表示，预训练草图解码器将其渲染为可解释图像。模型可以在文本推理过程中交替生成视觉潜在表示。

Result: 在MazePlanning数据集上的实验表明，Latent Sketchpad在保持骨干模型推理能力的同时，提供了可比较甚至更优的推理性能，并在Gemma3和Qwen2.5-VL等不同MLLMs上具有良好的泛化性。

Conclusion: 通过将模型的文本推理扩展到视觉思维，该框架为人机交互和更广泛的应用开辟了新机会。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

TL;DR: OSWorld-MCP是首个全面公平的基准测试，用于评估计算机使用代理在真实环境中的工具调用、GUI操作和决策能力，通过自动代码生成管道创建158个高质量工具，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去评估主要关注GUI交互技能，而工具调用能力（如MCP支持的工具）被忽视，导致对集成工具调用的代理与仅评估GUI交互的代理进行比较不公平。

Method: 设计新颖的自动代码生成管道创建工具，并结合现有工具精选集，通过严格人工验证得到158个高质量工具，覆盖7个常见应用。

Result: 在OSWorld-MCP上的广泛评估显示，MCP工具普遍提高了任务成功率（如OpenAI o3从8.3%提升到20.4%，Claude 4 Sonnet从40.1%提升到43.3%），但即使最强模型工具调用率也仅为36.3%。

Conclusion: OSWorld-MCP通过明确测量MCP工具使用技能，深化了对多模态代理的理解，并为评估复杂工具辅助环境中的性能设定了新标准。

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%
to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of
assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for
improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring
MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents
and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted
environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的散射伪影校正方法，利用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并嵌入KAN网络层来学习高维散射特征，有效提升CBCT图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT在数据采集过程中容易受到散射影响，导致CT值偏差和组织对比度降低，从而降低诊断准确性。需要解决散射伪影问题。

Method: 利用散射概率密度分布在投影域具有旋转对称性的物理先验知识，使用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并将其嵌入Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks层中，结合散射光子分布的物理特性和KAN的复杂函数映射能力来准确表示散射。

Result: 通过合成和真实扫描实验验证，该方法能有效校正重建图像中的散射伪影，在定量指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习散射校正方法结合物理先验知识和KAN网络，能够准确建模散射分布，显著提升CBCT图像质量。

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

Method: 采用双分支CNN架构：RGB分支捕捉语义信息，频率分支关注高频伪影；引入通道注意力模块自适应融合异构特征；设计FSC损失函数结合焦点损失、监督对比损失和频率中心边界损失。

Result: 在DiFF基准测试中表现优异，涵盖文本到图像、图像到图像、人脸交换和人脸编辑四种代表性伪造方法，超越人类平均准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且具有潜力，能够为保护AI生态系统免受视觉伪造攻击做出贡献。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Group Relative Attention Guidance (GRAG)的新方法，通过重新加权DiT模型中不同token的delta值来调节编辑强度，实现无需调参的连续细粒度图像编辑控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Diffusion-in-Transformer的图像编辑方法缺乏对编辑程度的有效控制，限制了实现更定制化结果的能力。

Method: 通过分析DiT模型中的MM-Attention机制，发现Query和Key tokens共享一个仅与层相关的偏置向量。将该偏置解释为模型固有的编辑行为，而每个token与其对应偏置之间的delta编码了内容特定的编辑信号。提出GRAG方法重新加权不同token的delta值来调节模型对输入图像相对于编辑指令的关注度。

Result: 在现有图像编辑框架上的大量实验表明，GRAG只需四行代码即可集成，持续提升编辑质量。与常用的Classifier-Free Guidance相比，GRAG实现了更平滑和更精确的编辑程度控制。

Conclusion: GRAG是一种简单而有效的方法，能够在无需调参的情况下实现对图像编辑强度的连续细粒度控制，显著提升了编辑质量和控制精度。

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/little-misfit/GRAG-Image-Editing.

*Mia Kan,Yilin Liu,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAGE方法，通过结构感知和生成合成实现零样本视频过渡，在多样片段间产生平滑、语义一致的过渡效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频过渡方法在处理大时间间隔或显著语义差异的片段时存在局限性，需要内容感知和视觉连贯的过渡解决方案

Method: 结合结构引导（线图和运动流）与生成合成，无需微调即可实现零样本视频过渡

Result: 在定量指标和用户研究中，SAGE优于传统和生成基线方法

Conclusion: SAGE方法能够有效处理多样片段间的视频过渡，提供高质量、语义一致的过渡效果

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于摄像头的检测模型在基础设施感知场景中性能不佳的问题，包括多视角设置、多样化摄像头配置、视觉输入退化以及不同道路布局等挑战。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的BEV感知框架，包含图增强融合模块，利用摄像头与BEV单元之间的几何关系和潜在视觉线索，将多视角图像特征集成到BEV空间。

Conclusion: MIC-BEV展示了在现实世界部署的潜力，为智能交通系统提供可靠的基础设施感知解决方案。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

### [68] [Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709)
*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现预训练的视觉Transformer（ViT）能够自然涌现出物体绑定能力，即识别哪些图像块属于同一物体的能力。这种IsSameObject能力在自监督模型（DINO、MAE、CLIP）中表现突出，但在ImageNet监督模型中较弱，表明这是通过特定预训练目标获得的能力而非架构特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉Transformer是否自然具备物体绑定能力，即识别哪些图像块属于同一物体的能力，以及这种能力如何影响模型性能。

Method: 使用相似性探针从ViT各层的图像块嵌入中解码IsSameObject属性，分析不同预训练目标下该能力的表现，并通过消融实验验证其对下游任务的影响。

Result: IsSameObject解码准确率超过90%，在自监督ViT中可靠涌现，但在ImageNet监督模型中较弱。该能力编码在物体特征之上的低维子空间中，并主动引导注意力机制。

Conclusion: ViT自然具备物体绑定能力，挑战了认为ViT缺乏物体绑定的观点，展示了连接主义系统中"哪些部分属于一起"的符号知识如何自然涌现。

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

TL;DR: ProMoE是一个针对扩散变换器的MoE框架，通过两步路由器和显式路由指导解决视觉token与语言token的差异问题，提升专家专业化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE方法在扩散变换器中效果有限，主要因为视觉token存在空间冗余和功能异质性，阻碍专家专业化，而语言token语义密集且变化明显。

Method: 提出两步路由器：条件路由按功能角色划分条件/无条件token集合，原型路由通过可学习原型基于语义内容细化条件token分配；引入路由对比损失增强原型路由过程。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，ProMoE在Rectified Flow和DDPM训练目标下均超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: ProMoE通过显式路由指导和对比损失有效解决了视觉MoE中的专家专业化问题，为视觉领域的MoE应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续空间视频生成发展迅速，而离散方法由于误差累积和长上下文不一致性问题而落后，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 将视频生成任务制定为离散时空标记的迭代全局优化，采用线性化度量路径和分辨率相关时间步移机制，以及异步时间微调策略。

Result: 在挑战性视频和图像生成基准测试中，URSA始终优于现有离散方法，性能与最先进的连续扩散方法相当。

Conclusion: URSA证明了离散生成建模在视频生成中的潜力，能够高效扩展到高分辨率图像合成和长持续时间视频生成。

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型虽然能够生成长序列且保持历史一致性，但无法利用未来条件引导当前生成，在预定义相机轨迹的视频生成中会导致与场景碰撞，进而导致生成崩溃。

Method: 提出了生成式视图拼接（GVS）采样算法，将机器人规划中的扩散拼接技术扩展到视频生成；引入全向引导技术，通过同时条件化过去和未来增强时间一致性；提出闭环机制实现长程连贯性。

Result: GVS实现了稳定、无碰撞、帧间一致且能闭环的相机引导视频生成，适用于各种预定义相机路径，包括奥斯卡·路透斯瓦德的不可能阶梯。

Conclusion: GVS方法能够有效解决自回归视频扩散模型在相机引导生成中的局限性，提供了一种通用的视频拼接解决方案，兼容任何使用扩散强制训练的现成视频模型。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MSRANetV2的卷积神经网络架构，专门用于结直肠组织图像分类，在公开数据集上取得了优异的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌是全球癌症相关死亡的主要原因，传统诊断方法存在主观性强、耗时且易变异的缺点，需要开发更精确高效的诊断工具。

Method: 基于ResNet50V2主干网络，结合残差注意力机制和压缩激励模块，通过通道对齐和上采样操作融合多尺度特征表示。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，模型在7K数据集上平均精度0.9884±0.0151，召回率0.9900±0.0151，F1分数0.9900±0.0145，AUC 0.9999±0.00006，测试准确率0.9905±0.0025；在100K数据集上表现类似优异。

Conclusion: MSRANetV2是一个可靠、可解释且高性能的结直肠组织分类模型，能够有效提升诊断精度和效率。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM
visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by
highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate
that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural
model for classifying CRC tissues.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中学习满足线性时序逻辑任务的最优规划时面临的指数级样本复杂度问题。

Method: 将任务规范转换为Büchi自动机，使用无模型方法收集转移样本，在线构建乘积半马尔可夫决策过程，并采用基于价值的强化学习算法和奖励塑形技术。

Result: 在确定性网格世界模拟中测试，奖励塑形显著减少了收敛时间，且随着状态和动作空间增大，使用选项的优势更加明显。

Conclusion: 该方法能够合成设计正确的控制器，无需学习多智能体系统的底层转移模型，选项的使用在大规模多智能体系统中尤为重要。

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for accelerated learning of optimal plans for
a given task represented using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) in multi-agent
systems. Given a set of options (temporally abstract actions) available to each
agent, we convert the task specification into the corresponding Buchi Automaton
and proceed with a model-free approach which collects transition samples and
constructs a product Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) on-the-fly.
Value-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms can then be used to synthesize a
correct-by-design controller without learning the underlying transition model
of the multi-agent system. The exponential sample complexity due to multiple
agents is dealt with using a novel reward shaping approach. We test the
proposed algorithm in a deterministic gridworld simulation for different tasks
and find that the reward shaping results in significant reduction in
convergence times. We also infer that using options becomes increasing more
relevant as the state and action space increases in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Autonomous drone technology holds significant promise for enhancing search
and rescue operations during evacuations by guiding humans toward safety and
supporting broader emergency response efforts. However, their application in
dynamic, real-time evacuation support remains limited. Existing models often
overlook the psychological and emotional complexity of human behavior under
extreme stress. In real-world fire scenarios, evacuees frequently deviate from
designated safe routes due to panic and uncertainty. To address these
challenges, this paper presents a multi-agent coordination framework in which
autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assist human evacuees in real-time
by locating, intercepting, and guiding them to safety under uncertain
conditions. We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP), where two heterogeneous UAV agents, a high-level rescuer (HLR)
and a low-level rescuer (LLR), coordinate through shared observations and
complementary capabilities. Human behavior is captured using an agent-based
model grounded in empirical psychology, where panic dynamically affects
decision-making and movement in response to environmental stimuli. The
environment features stochastic fire spread, unknown evacuee locations, and
limited visibility, requiring UAVs to plan over long horizons to search for
humans and adapt in real-time. Our framework employs the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm with recurrent policies to enable robust
decision-making in partially observable settings. Simulation results
demonstrate that the UAV team can rapidly locate and intercept evacuees,
significantly reducing the time required for them to reach safety compared to
scenarios without UAV assistance.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large foundation models and multi-agent systems
offer unprecedented capabilities, yet current Human-in-the-Loop (HiTL)
paradigms inadequately integrate human expertise, often leading to cognitive
overload and decision-making bottlenecks in complex, high-stakes environments.
We propose the "Human-Machine Social Hybrid Intelligence" (HMS-HI) framework, a
novel architecture designed for deep, collaborative decision-making between
groups of human experts and LLM-powered AI agents. HMS-HI is built upon three
core pillars: (1) a \textbf{Shared Cognitive Space (SCS)} for unified,
multi-modal situational awareness and structured world modeling; (2) a
\textbf{Dynamic Role and Task Allocation (DRTA)} module that adaptively assigns
tasks to the most suitable agent (human or AI) based on capabilities and
workload; and (3) a \textbf{Cross-Species Trust Calibration (CSTC)} protocol
that fosters transparency, accountability, and mutual adaptation through
explainable declarations and structured feedback. Validated in a high-fidelity
urban emergency response simulation, HMS-HI significantly reduced civilian
casualties by 72\% and cognitive load by 70\% compared to traditional HiTL
approaches, demonstrating superior decision quality, efficiency, and human-AI
trust. An ablation study confirms the critical contribution of each module,
highlighting that engineered trust and shared context are foundational for
scalable, synergistic human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 在非受控环境中，扬声器的数量、位置和听音位置/区域各不相同，偏离标准布局会引入声场误差，降低音频内容再现的声学音色、成像和清晰度。

Method: 使用共轭先验分布更新扬声器-听者方向的估计布局；数字滤波器将扬声器声学响应适配到估计听音区域的共同参考目标；通过灵敏度/效率目标优化频域平移系数，并受空间、电学和声学领域约束。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效校正非标准扬声器布局中的声场误差，提高多声道音频再现的准确性。

Abstract: Surround sound systems commonly distribute loudspeakers along standardized
layouts for multichannel audio reproduction. However in less controlled
environments, practical layouts vary in loudspeaker quantity, placement, and
listening locations / areas. Deviations from standard layouts introduce
sound-field errors that degrade acoustic timbre, imaging, and clarity of audio
content reproduction. This work introduces both Bayesian loudspeaker
normalization and content panning optimization methods for sound-field
correction. Conjugate prior distributions over loudspeaker-listener directions
update estimated layouts for non-stationary listening locations; digital
filters adapt loudspeaker acoustic responses to a common reference target at
the estimated listening area without acoustic measurements. Frequency-domain
panning coefficients are then optimized via sensitivity / efficiency objectives
subject to spatial, electrical, and acoustic domain constraints; normalized and
panned loudspeakers form virtual loudspeakers in standardized layouts for
accurate multichannel reproduction. Experiments investigate robustness of
Bayesian adaptation, and panning optimizations in practical applications.

Motivation: 探索自监督语音表示与肌电信号之间的线性关系，利用这种关系开发无需显式发音模型和声码器训练的EMG到语音生成系统。

Method: 使用线性映射将自监督语音特征与肌电信号功率关联，利用肌电功率向量在特征空间中的聚类特性，直接映射EMG信号到语音特征空间进行语音合成。

Result: 发现自监督语音特征与肌电信号功率存在强线性关系（r=0.85），不同发音手势对应的EMG功率向量在特征空间中形成可分簇，成功实现了端到端EMG到语音生成。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型隐式编码了发音机制，利用这一特性可以开发高效的神经肌肉语音接口，为语音障碍患者提供新的沟通解决方案。

Abstract: We present a neuromuscular speech interface that translates electromyographic
(EMG) signals collected from orofacial muscles during speech articulation
directly into audio. We show that self-supervised speech (SS) representations
exhibit a strong linear relationship with the electrical power of muscle action
potentials: SS features can be linearly mapped to EMG power with a correlation
of $r = 0.85$. Moreover, EMG power vectors corresponding to different
articulatory gestures form structured and separable clusters in feature space.
This relationship: $\text{SS features}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{linear mapping}}$
$\text{EMG power}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{gesture-specific clustering}}$
$\text{articulatory movements}$, highlights that SS models implicitly encode
articulatory mechanisms. Leveraging this property, we directly map EMG signals
to SS feature space and synthesize speech, enabling end-to-end EMG-to-speech
generation without explicit articulatory models and vocoder training.

TL;DR: MGAudio是一个基于流的视频到音频生成框架，通过模型引导的双角色对齐机制，在VGGSound上实现了最先进的性能，FAD降至0.40。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖分类器引导或无分类器引导，而MGAudio旨在让生成模型通过专门设计的训练目标来自我引导，提高视频条件音频生成的质量。

Method: 采用可扩展的基于流的Transformer模型，结合双角色对齐机制（视听编码器同时作为条件模块和特征对齐器），以及模型引导目标来增强跨模态一致性和音频真实性。

Result: 在VGGSound上FAD降至0.40，显著超越最佳无分类器引导基线，在FD、IS和对齐指标上一致优于现有方法，在UnAV-100基准上也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 模型引导的双角色对齐是条件视频到音频生成中强大且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: We present MGAudio, a novel flow-based framework for open-domain
video-to-audio generation, which introduces model-guided dual-role alignment as
a central design principle. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
classifier-based or classifier-free guidance, MGAudio enables the generative
model to guide itself through a dedicated training objective designed for
video-conditioned audio generation. The framework integrates three main
components: (1) a scalable flow-based Transformer model, (2) a dual-role
alignment mechanism where the audio-visual encoder serves both as a
conditioning module and as a feature aligner to improve generation quality, and
(3) a model-guided objective that enhances cross-modal coherence and audio
realism. MGAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance on VGGSound, reducing
FAD to 0.40, substantially surpassing the best classifier-free guidance
baselines, and consistently outperforms existing methods across FD, IS, and
alignment metrics. It also generalizes well to the challenging UnAV-100
benchmark. These results highlight model-guided dual-role alignment as a
powerful and scalable paradigm for conditional video-to-audio generation. Code

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) has recently attracted attention as a low-power
alternative to neural networks due to its simple and interpretable inference
mechanisms. However, its performance on speech-related tasks remains limited.
This paper proposes TsetlinKWS, the first algorithm-hardware co-design
framework for the Convolutional Tsetlin Machine (CTM) on the 12-keyword
spotting task. Firstly, we introduce a novel Mel-Frequency Spectral Coefficient
and Spectral Flux (MFSC-SF) feature extraction scheme together with spectral
convolution, enabling the CTM to reach its first-ever competitive accuracy of
87.35% on the 12-keyword spotting task. Secondly, we develop an Optimized
Grouped Block-Compressed Sparse Row (OG-BCSR) algorithm that achieves a
remarkable 9.84$\times$ reduction in model size, significantly improving the
storage efficiency on CTMs. Finally, we propose a state-driven architecture
tailored for the CTM, which simultaneously exploits data reuse and sparsity to
achieve high energy efficiency. The full system is evaluated in 65 nm process
technology, consuming 16.58 $\mu$W at 0.7 V with a compact 0.63 mm$^2$ core
area. TsetlinKWS requires only 907k logic operations per inference,
representing a 10$\times$ reduction compared to the state-of-the-art KWS
accelerators, positioning the CTM as a highly-efficient candidate for
ultra-low-power speech applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的4D音频-视觉手术场景表示框架，通过将相控麦克风阵列的声学定位信息投影到RGB-D相机的动态点云上，实现手术场景的多模态理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Purpose: Surgical scene understanding is key to advancing computer-aided and
intelligent surgical systems. Current approaches predominantly rely on visual
data or end-to-end learning, which limits fine-grained contextual modeling.
This work aims to enhance surgical scene representations by integrating 3D
acoustic information, enabling temporally and spatially aware multimodal
understanding of surgical environments.
  Methods: We propose a novel framework for generating 4D audio-visual
representations of surgical scenes by projecting acoustic localization
information from a phased microphone array onto dynamic point clouds from an
RGB-D camera. A transformer-based acoustic event detection module identifies
relevant temporal segments containing tool-tissue interactions which are
spatially localized in the audio-visual scene representation. The system was
experimentally evaluated in a realistic operating room setup during simulated
surgical procedures performed by experts.
  Results: The proposed method successfully localizes surgical acoustic events
in 3D space and associates them with visual scene elements. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates accurate spatial sound localization and robust fusion
of multimodal data, providing a comprehensive, dynamic representation of
surgical activity.
  Conclusion: This work introduces the first approach for spatial sound
localization in dynamic surgical scenes, marking a significant advancement
toward multimodal surgical scene representations. By integrating acoustic and
visual data, the proposed framework enables richer contextual understanding and
provides a foundation for future intelligent and autonomous surgical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于编解码器的TTS模型在预训练鲁棒语音编解码器和量化误差方面的局限性，探索连续值生成模型作为替代方案。

Method: 提出BELLE框架，将每个梅尔频谱图帧视为从学习到的超分布中采样的高斯分布，使用贝叶斯证据学习从多个预训练TTS模型合成的多样化语音样本中进行知识蒸馏。

Result: BELLE在仅使用约十分之一训练数据的情况下，与当前最佳开源TTS模型相比表现出高度竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: BELLE展示了连续值自回归TTS框架的有效性，通过贝叶斯证据学习和多样化数据合成实现了高质量语音生成。

Abstract: Codec-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have recently gained traction for
their efficiency and strong performance in voice cloning. However, codec-based
TTS faces limitations due to the challenges of pretraining robust speech codecs
and the quality degradation introduced by quantization errors. Emerging
evidence suggests that continuous-valued generative models can alleviate these
issues and serve as a promising alternative. Yet, effectively modelling diverse
speech patterns and developing reliable sampling strategies for
continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) TTS remains underexplored. In this work,
we propose BELLE, Bayesian evidential learning with language modelling for TTS,
a novel continuous-valued AR framework that directly predicts mel-spectrograms
from textual input. BELLE treats each mel-spectrogram frame as a Gaussian
distribution sampled from a learned hyper distribution, enabling principled
uncertainty estimation, particularly in scenarios with parallel data (i.e., one
text-audio prompt paired with multiple speech samples). To obtain such data,
diverse speech samples are synthesized using multiple pre-trained TTS models
given the same text-audio prompts, which are distilled into BELLE via Bayesian
evidential learning. Experimental results indicate that BELLE demonstrates
highly competitive performance compared with the current best open-source TTS
models, even though BELLE is trained on a large amount of synthetic data and
uses only approximately one-tenth of their training data. Audio samples
generated by BELLE are available at https://belletts.github.io/Belle/. The
code, checkpoints, and synthetic data will be released after the paper is
accepted.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的帧在线融合框架，用于多个无失真差分波束形成器的组合，以解决传统自适应凸组合算法在高度非平稳场景中跟踪能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定波束形成虽然性能稳定且不依赖噪声统计估计，但单个波束形成器无法适应变化的声学条件，限制了其干扰抑制能力。传统自适应凸组合算法在高度非平稳场景（如快速移动干扰）中无法可靠跟踪快速变化。

Method: 提出帧在线神经融合框架，通过神经网络估计多个无失真差分波束形成器的组合权重，替代传统的自适应凸组合算法。

Result: 与传统自适应凸组合相比，所提方法能更有效地适应动态声学环境，在保持无失真约束的同时实现更强的干扰抑制。

Conclusion: 基于神经网络的融合框架能够有效解决传统自适应凸组合在高度非平稳场景中的局限性，提供更优越的干扰抑制性能。

Abstract: Fixed beamforming is widely used in practice since it does not depend on the
estimation of noise statistics and provides relatively stable performance.
However, a single beamformer cannot adapt to varying acoustic conditions, which
limits its interference suppression capability. To address this, adaptive
convex combination (ACC) algorithms have been introduced, where the outputs of
multiple fixed beamformers are linearly combined to improve robustness.
Nevertheless, ACC often fails in highly non-stationary scenarios, such as
rapidly moving interference, since its adaptive updates cannot reliably track
rapid changes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frame-online neural
fusion framework for multiple distortionless differential beamformers, which
estimates the combination weights through a neural network. Compared with
conventional ACC, the proposed method adapts more effectively to dynamic
acoustic environments, achieving stronger interference suppression while
maintaining the distortionless constraint.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合小波变换和梅尔频率特性的时域特征提取方法TMFWC，降低了计算复杂度，并与储层计算结合提高了音频信号处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MFCC特征缺乏时间信息，而传统小波变换在语音分析中频率分辨率不足且不符合人耳听觉感知。需要结合两者的优点开发新特征。

Method: 提出时域梅尔频率小波系数(TMFWC)方法，在时域结合小波变换概念提取梅尔尺度特征，避免频域转换的计算负担。

Result: TMFWC方法显著降低了计算复杂度，与储层计算结合后大幅提升了音频信号处理效率。

Conclusion: TMFWC成功融合了MFCC和小波变换的优点，提供了一种计算效率更高的语音特征提取方法。

Abstract: Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech
signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most
widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition
applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering
taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it
provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the
information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet
transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency
information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of
non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform
frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in
analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies,
and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to
develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet
transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features.
The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods
require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of
Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are
proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the
concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of
time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining
our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique
with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the
efficiency of audio signal processing.

TL;DR: STAR-Bench是一个新的音频基准测试，专注于评估模型在时间和3D空间中对声音动态的推理能力，揭示了现有模型在细粒度感知推理方面的显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频基准主要测试可从文本字幕恢复的语义，掩盖了细粒度感知推理的缺陷，需要正式定义和测量音频4D智能（时间+3D空间的声音动态推理）。

Method: STAR-Bench结合基础声学感知（六个属性，绝对和相对机制）和整体时空推理（包括连续和离散过程的片段重排序，以及静态定位、多源关系和动态轨迹的空间任务）。数据通过程序合成、物理模拟音频和四阶段人工标注流程确保高质量。

Result: 评估19个模型显示与人类存在显著差距，形成能力层次：闭源模型受限于细粒度感知，开源模型在感知、知识和推理方面均落后。相比先前基准，STAR-Bench导致准确率大幅下降（时间-31.5%，空间-35.2%）。

Conclusion: STAR-Bench为开发具有更稳健物理世界理解能力的未来模型提供了关键见解和清晰路径，专注于语言难以描述的线索。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large
Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that
can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained
perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as
reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to
measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six
attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete
processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source
relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two
methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use
procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we
follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection
based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only
answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops
(-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically
hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared
with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked
by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception,
knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear
path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of
the physical world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析通过联合分析文本和图像数据，比单模态方法能提供更丰富和准确的情感理解

Method: BERT-ViT-EF结合BERT和ViT编码器进行早期融合；DTCN在BERT后添加额外Transformer层，并使用对比学习对齐文本和图像表示

Result: 在TumEmo数据集上达到78.4%准确率和78.3% F1分数，在MVSA-Single上达到76.6%准确率和75.9% F1分数

Conclusion: 早期融合和更深层次的上下文建模在基于Transformer的多模态情感分析中具有显著优势

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析MACE力场的计算瓶颈，评估低精度执行策略，发现cuEquivariance后端和混合精度推理能显著加速SO(3)等变力场，同时保持物理保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习力场计算成本高，需要系统评估低精度算术和GPU优化内核是否能降低成本而不损害物理保真度。

Method: 端到端分析MACE性能，比较e3nn和cuEquivariance后端，评估FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16精度设置，进行推理、NVT/NPT水模拟和训练测试。

Result: cuEquivariance减少推理延迟约3倍，线性层使用BF16/FP16可再提速4倍，NVT/NPT MD能量和热力学观测量保持在运行间变异性内，半精度训练会降低力RMSE。

Conclusion: 融合等变内核和混合精度推理能显著加速先进力场，建议默认使用cuEquivariance+FP32，线性层启用BF16/FP16以获得最大吞吐量，训练保持FP32。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

Motivation: 对抗性攻击可能导致医疗AI系统做出危险误判，延误治疗或误诊，特别是在服务不足人群中威胁患者安全。

Method: 通过威胁建模、实验基准测试和模型评估，在皮肤科数据集上进行实证实验，测试对抗训练和蒸馏等防御方法。

Result: 对抗性方法显著降低分类准确率，防御措施虽能降低攻击成功率，但需与干净数据上的模型性能保持平衡。

Conclusion: 需要整合技术、伦理和政策方法，构建更具韧性和公平性的医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种浅层森林方法DiNo和RanBu，通过将少量深度受限的树转换为高效的基于距离的预测器，显著降低了随机森林的推理延迟和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机森林集成在表格预测任务中表现强劲，但依赖数百棵深度树会导致高推理延迟和内存需求，限制了在延迟敏感或资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: DiNo通过观测对的最远共同祖先测量同源距离，RanBu对Breiman的经典邻近度度量应用核平滑。两种方法都在森林训练后完全操作，无需额外生长树，仅需轻量级矩阵向量操作来调整单个带宽参数h。

Result: 在3个合成基准和25个公共数据集上，RanBu匹配或超过了全深度随机森林的准确性（特别是在高噪声设置中），同时将训练加推理时间减少了95%。DiNo在低噪声机制中以适度的计算成本实现了最佳偏差-方差权衡。两种方法都直接扩展到分位数回归，在保持准确性的同时实现了显著的速度提升。

Conclusion: DiNo和RanBu方法通过将浅层树转换为基于距离的预测器，有效解决了随机森林的延迟和内存问题，在保持或提高准确性的同时大幅提升了效率。

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

*Nuo Chen,Zehua Li,Keqin Bao,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TracePile是一个包含260万样本的大规模语料库，将代码执行转化为显式的逐步推理链（Chain of Execution），通过三种训练设置显著提升了LLaMA、Qwen等模型在数学、代码、逻辑和算法任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在代码训练中存在推理表达隐式、与语法或实现噪声纠缠的问题，使得直接在原始代码上训练效果不佳。

Method: 构建TracePile语料库，将代码执行转化为显式的逐步推理链（CoE），包含变量追踪问题和代码重写，采用继续预训练、指令调优和两阶段微调三种训练设置。

Result: 在四个基础模型和20个基准测试上均取得一致改进，LLaMA3.1-8B在九个数学数据集上平均提升7.1%，在LiveCodeBench、CRUX和MMLU上也有明显提升。

Conclusion: TracePile通过将代码执行转化为显式推理链，有效提升了LLM的推理能力，证明了代码执行轨迹作为训练数据的价值。

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

*Mortesa Hussaini,Jan Theiß,Anthony Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为FLIU的个性化联邦学习方法，通过自适应个性化因子来改进FedAvg，在异构数据环境中平衡本地性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异构数据联邦学习中，本地模型会收敛到各自的局部最优解，偏离全局数据分布。FedAvg等聚合方法会产生客户端漂移问题，导致对大多数客户端次优的更新。现有个性化方法只关注本地性能，忽视了FedAvg带来的泛化能力优势。

Method: 提出了FLIU方法，在FedAvg基础上增加简单的个性化步骤，使用自适应个性化因子。在不同数据分布条件下（IID、病理非IID、Dirichlet分布）使用MNIST和CIFAR-10进行实证评估，分析单轮通信中的不同阶段。

Result: 对联邦学习方法进行了全面评估，包括本地性能和泛化能力。FLIU方法在复杂数据异构环境下表现出色，能够更好地平衡个性化与泛化需求。

Conclusion: FLIU通过自适应个性化因子有效解决了客户端漂移问题，在保持良好泛化能力的同时提升了本地性能，为异构数据联邦学习提供了更平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

TL;DR: 提出数字到事件推理任务，通过推理感知框架从数值时间序列中推断结构化事件，解决现有方法缺乏对数值变化背后潜在事件和推理过程解释的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在数值时间序列理解方面存在局限，主要关注预测或趋势描述，而未能揭示驱动数值变化的潜在事件或解释其推理过程。

Method: 提出推理感知框架，包含代理引导事件提取器(AGE)、基于标记多元Hawkes的合成生成器(EveDTS)，以及结合时间序列编码器和结构化解码器的两阶段微调管道。

Result: 在多领域数据集上的实验表明，该方法在事件级精度和召回率方面显著优于强LLM基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为连接定量推理和语义理解提供了新方向，使LLM能够直接从数值动态中解释和预测事件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO)框架，通过最大似然估计将偏好优化与排名选择建模相结合，支持多种反馈格式，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM对齐方法主要依赖成对偏好优化，忽略了从更丰富的人类反馈中学习的机会，如多选比较和top-k排名。

Method: 提出了RCPO统一框架，支持基于效用和基于排名的选择模型，包含DPO、SimPO等现有方法，并为更丰富的反馈格式提供原则性训练目标。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-it模型上的实证研究表明，RCPO在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard基准测试中始终优于竞争基线。

Conclusion: RCPO展示了直接利用排名偏好数据结合适当选择模型可以实现更有效的对齐，为将排名选择建模融入LLM训练提供了通用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

TL;DR: LLMCOMP是一种利用解码器专用大语言模型进行科学数据压缩的新范式，在严格误差约束下比现有压缩方法提升30%压缩比


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率科学模拟和观测系统产生海量时空数据，需要高效且有误差约束的压缩方法；同时解码器专用LLM在建模复杂序列数据方面表现出色

Method: 将3D场量化为离散token，通过Z-order曲线排列保持局部性，使用覆盖引导采样提升训练效率，用自回归transformer建模token转换，压缩时进行top-k预测并存储排名索引和回退校正

Result: 在多个再分析数据集上的实验表明，LLMCOMP在严格误差约束下持续优于最先进压缩器，压缩比提升高达30%

Conclusion: LLM在作为高保真科学数据的通用压缩器方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Noise Combination Sampling的新方法，通过合成噪声子空间中的最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，从而在扩散模型的生成过程中自然地嵌入条件信息，无需依赖逐步超参数调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型在零样本逆问题求解中表现出色，但存在一个固有困境：过度整合观测信息会干扰生成过程，而整合不足则无法强调逆问题的约束条件。

Method: 提出Noise Combination Sampling方法，从噪声子空间中合成最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，替代标准DDPM过程中的噪声项，使条件信息自然嵌入生成过程。

Result: 该方法可应用于广泛的逆问题求解器，包括图像压缩，特别是在生成步骤数T较小时，以可忽略的计算开销实现优越性能，显著提高鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: Noise Combination Sampling方法有效解决了扩散模型在逆问题求解中条件信息整合的平衡问题，提供了一种无需超参数调优的稳定解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

Result: 证明了在无限基础集上MAS函数不存在，但提出的弱MAS模型具有Holder连续性稳定性，且能构建通用单调模型来逼近所有单调集合函数。

Conclusion: 实验表明，该模型在集合包含任务中优于不包含集合包含归纳偏置的标准集合模型，为集合包含问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

Method: 在真实世界条件下评估SKEL性能，让实际用户基于当前视角和需求细化输入标签。使用iLog移动应用，大学生参与为期四周的研究。

Result: 结果凸显了在用户努力与数据质量之间找到适当平衡的挑战，同时展示了SKEL的潜在益处，包括减少标注工作和提高收集数据质量。

Conclusion: SKEL在真实用户环境中具有应用价值，能够有效平衡用户标注负担与数据质量需求，为数字个人助理的标注质量改进提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

Motivation: 传统Transformer在高能粒子碰撞等大数据吞吐环境中部署困难，其二次复杂度需要大量资源并增加推理延迟。

Method: 结合linformer架构，采用基于运动学特征的空间感知粒子分区方法，并引入卷积层来捕捉局部相关性，借鉴了喷注物理学的见解。

Result: 在喷注分类任务中优于标准linformer，性能与全注意力Transformer相当，但资源消耗显著减少，推理延迟更低。在ModelNet10点云分类数据集上也验证了这一趋势。

Conclusion: SAL-T通过物理启发的空间分区和局部相关性捕捉，成功解决了Transformer在高数据吞吐环境中的部署挑战，在保持性能的同时大幅提升了效率。

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LRQK是一个两阶段框架，通过低秩分解查询和键矩阵来减少KV缓存的内存占用，同时保持注意力输出的精确性，在长上下文场景下实现显著内存节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着输入文本长度增加，LLM中的KV缓存会导致GPU内存成本过高，限制了在资源受限设备上进行长上下文推理。现有方法如KV量化和剪枝虽然减少内存使用，但存在数值精度损失或关键值对保留不理想的问题。

Method: LRQK采用两阶段框架：在预填充阶段将全精度查询和键矩阵分解为紧凑的秩-r因子；在解码阶段使用这些低维投影计算代理注意力分数，并通过混合GPU-CPU缓存机制，仅传输缺失的全精度KV对。

Result: 在RULER和LongBench基准测试中，使用LLaMA-3-8B和Qwen2.5-7B的实验表明，LRQK在长上下文设置下匹配或超越领先的稀疏注意力方法，同时实现显著的内存节省且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: LRQK框架有效解决了长上下文推理中的内存瓶颈问题，通过低秩分解和混合缓存策略，在保持精确注意力的同时大幅减少内存使用，为资源受限设备上的长文本处理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

TL;DR: 该论文将选项框架应用于高速公路自动驾驶任务，通过定义纵向和横向操作的专用选项，结合安全和舒适约束，实现了分层控制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度强化学习在自动驾驶中有广泛应用，但很少使用选项框架。该框架天然适合分层控制应用，特别是自动驾驶任务。

Method: 定义了具有安全和舒适约束的纵向和横向操作专用选项，提出了几种分层控制设置，并基于最先进强化学习技术开发了实用算法。

Conclusion: 基于混合选项的灵活策略在所有研究方法中表现最好，优于基于动作的基线策略，同时比传统的连续动作策略更易于解释。

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

TL;DR: CLP是一个连续层剪枝框架，通过可微凹门算法自动识别最佳剪枝层段，并使用截止端点调优策略恢复模型性能，在多种模型上显著优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在资源受限的边缘设备上部署面临挑战，现有层剪枝方法依赖手工指标且忽略层间依赖关系，会破坏信息流并严重降低性能。

Method: 提出CLP框架：1）可微凹门算法通过梯度优化自动识别连续层段进行剪枝；2）截止端点调优策略仅微调剪枝段相邻层来恢复性能。

Result: 在LLaMA2、LLaMA3和Qwen等多种模型上测试，在20%剪枝率下，LLaMA3-70B平均性能保持率达95.34%，比基线方法提升4.29%-30.52%。

Conclusion: CLP能有效剪枝大型语言模型且保持高性能，还可与量化技术结合进一步压缩模型，仅带来轻微性能损失。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

Conclusion: SAEA框架通过建模预测误差的时空自相关性，有效提升了交通预测模型的准确性，证明了考虑误差相关性的重要性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷等离子体是一种环保的种子萌发增强方法，但由于复杂的种子-等离子体-环境相互作用，效果难以预测。需要开发可靠的预测模型来优化冷等离子体在精准农业中的应用。

Method: 使用机器学习模型（梯度提升、XGBoost、Extra Trees及其混合模型）预测大豆、大麦、向日葵、萝卜和番茄在介质阻挡放电等离子体处理下的萌发提升。通过特征工程分析等离子体参数与萌发率的关系。

Result: Extra Trees模型表现最佳（R²=0.919，RMSE=3.21，MAE=2.62），特征缩减后进一步提升至R²=0.925。发现激素效应：7-15kV、200-500s处理效果最佳，超过20kV或长时间暴露会降低萌发率。放电功率≥100W时萌发率最高。不同物种和品种预测精度差异明显。

Conclusion: 该机器学习框架成功预测了冷等离子体处理对种子萌发的提升效果，并集成到MLflow中，为精准农业中的种子处理优化提供了决策支持工具。

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

TL;DR: ELBO-KTO是一种结合ELBO替代扩散对数似然与无配对偏好目标(KTO)的方法，用于对齐扩散语言模型与人类偏好，在多项基准测试中表现优于基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(dLLMs)作为自回归生成器的替代方案，但由于序列对数似然难以计算且配对偏好数据收集成本高，对齐人类偏好具有挑战性。

Method: 使用ELBO替代扩散对数似然，结合基于前景理论的无配对偏好优化目标(KTO)，并采用方差减少技术来稳定训练梯度。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct上，ELBO-KTO在kto-mix-14k和UltraFeedback-Binary上分别获得65.9%和62.3%的调整胜率，在下游任务中表现与基础模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: 无配对偏好优化是扩散LLM中配对对齐的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and

underexplored. We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed

compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for
physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur
further research in generative modeling for inverse design. Code & data can be

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

Result: 发现特征稀疏性和特征重要性不会引起不连续的相变，网络稀疏性更好地表征MoE模型；高网络稀疏性模型表现出更高的单语义性；专家在适当初始化时会自然组织成连贯的特征组合。

Conclusion: MoE模型中的网络稀疏性可能在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更可解释的模型，挑战了可解释性和能力之间存在根本冲突的常见假设。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

*Xiangfei Qiu,Xingjian Wu,Hanyin Cheng,Xvyuan Liu,Chenjuan Guo,Jilin Hu,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分解的损失函数DBLoss，通过指数移动平均将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量，分别计算损失并加权，显著提升了深度学习预测模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MSE损失函数有时无法准确捕捉预测范围内的季节性模式或趋势，即使在前向传播中使用分解模块分别建模趋势和季节性。

Method: 使用指数移动平均将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量，分别计算这两个分量的损失，然后进行加权组合。DBLoss可作为通用损失函数与任何深度学习预测模型结合。

Result: 大量实验表明，DBLoss显著提升了最先进模型在多样化真实世界数据集上的性能表现。

Conclusion: DBLoss为时间序列损失函数设计提供了新的视角，能够有效提升预测模型的准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

TL;DR: 提出了HIPE方法，一种基于信息论的获取策略，在贝叶斯优化中平衡预测不确定性减少和超参数学习，特别适用于小批量、少样本场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统(准)随机初始化方法忽略了两个关键因素：(a)空间填充设计可能不利于减少预测不确定性；(b)初始化期间高效的超参数学习对高质量预测至关重要，这可能与空间填充设计冲突。

Method: 提出HIPE（超参数知情预测探索）策略，使用信息论原理平衡预测不确定性减少和超参数学习，并在高斯过程设置中推导出闭式表达式。

Result: 在主动学习和少样本贝叶斯优化的广泛实验中，HIPE在预测准确性、超参数识别和后续优化性能方面优于标准初始化策略，特别是在大批量、少样本场景中。

Conclusion: HIPE方法在贝叶斯优化的初始化阶段显著提升了性能，特别适用于现实世界应用中常见的大批量、少样本设置。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个神经-符号-因果架构，集成了LLM策略师、形式验证符号约束引擎和因果推理模块，在电子商务环境中展现出比纯LLM或LLM+符号约束架构更好的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自主决策代理存在高风险，缺乏架构保障时表现出灾难性脆弱性，相同能力仅因提示框架不同就产生截然不同的结果。

Method: 提出Chimera架构，整合三个互补组件：LLM策略师、形式验证符号约束引擎和因果推理模块（用于反事实推理）。在包含价格弹性、信任动态和季节性需求的真实电子商务环境中进行52周模拟基准测试。

Result: 在组织偏向销量或利润优化的场景下，纯LLM代理灾难性失败（销量场景损失99K美元）或破坏品牌信任（利润场景下降48.6%）。添加符号约束可防止灾难但仅达到Chimera利润的43-87%。Chimera始终提供最高回报（152万美元和196万美元，某些情况达220万美元）同时提升品牌信任（+1.8%和+10.8%，某些情况+20.86%），展现出提示无关的鲁棒性。TLA+形式验证证明所有场景零约束违规。

Conclusion: 架构设计而非提示工程决定了生产环境中自主代理的可靠性。Chimera架构为高风险领域部署LLM代理提供了有效的安全保障。

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Transformer和BiLSTM的并行预测框架，用于混沌系统预测，在Lorenz系统的自主演化预测和未测量变量推断任务中表现优于单分支架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混沌系统的非线性特性导致对初始条件极度敏感，传统方法无法同时捕捉时间序列的局部特征和全局依赖关系。

Method: 采用双分支架构：Transformer分支捕获长程依赖，BiLSTM分支提取局部时序特征，通过特征融合层整合互补表示。

Result: 在Lorenz系统的两个代表性任务中，该混合框架始终优于单分支架构，证明了其在混沌系统预测中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: Transformer和BiLSTM的并行混合框架能够有效解决混沌系统预测中局部特征和全局依赖的捕获问题，具有更好的预测性能。

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统越来越多地影响重要决策，但由于开发时缺乏明确的公平性考虑，存在歧视性影响的风险。

Method: 通过改进公平性测量方法、系统分解ML系统以预测偏见动态，以及设计有效的干预措施来减少算法歧视。

Result: 论文提供了更合适的公平性测量框架，能够系统性地分析ML系统中的偏见动态，并开发出在保持系统效用的同时减少歧视的干预方法。

Conclusion: 随着ML系统（包括生成式AI）日益融入社会，这项工作为确保机器学习的社会影响与更广泛的社会价值观保持一致奠定了基础，并指出了持续挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: This PhD thesis investigates the societal impact of machine learning (ML). ML
increasingly informs consequential decisions and recommendations, significantly
affecting many aspects of our lives. As these data-driven systems are often
developed without explicit fairness considerations, they carry the risk of
discriminatory effects. The contributions in this thesis enable more
appropriate measurement of fairness in ML systems, systematic decomposition of
ML systems to anticipate bias dynamics, and effective interventions that reduce
algorithmic discrimination while maintaining system utility. I conclude by
discussing ongoing challenges and future research directions as ML systems,
including generative artificial intelligence, become increasingly integrated
into society. This work offers a foundation for ensuring that ML's societal
impact aligns with broader social values.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MUStReason基准测试和PragCoT框架，用于评估和改进视频语言模型在讽刺检测任务中的表现，通过分离感知和推理过程来提升模型对隐含意图的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在讽刺检测等复杂任务上表现不佳，因为讽刺理解不仅依赖于字面内容，还需要结合语调、面部表情和对话上下文等非语言线索来推断说话者的真实意图。

Method: 开发了MUStReason诊断基准，包含模态特定相关线索和推理步骤的标注；提出了PragCoT框架，引导视频语言模型关注隐含意图而非字面含义。

Result: 通过MUStReason基准评估了视频语言模型的讽刺分类性能，并对生成的推理进行了定量和定性分析，将问题分解为感知和推理两个部分。

Conclusion: PragCoT框架能够有效提升视频语言模型在讽刺检测任务中的表现，通过关注隐含意图这一讽刺检测的核心属性来改进模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

TL;DR: 提出了一个原则性框架来减轻奖励模型中的虚假相关性偏见，同时保留反映真实偏好的潜在因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对齐技术（如人类反馈强化学习）中的奖励模型经常利用虚假相关性（如响应长度、歧视、谄媚等），这个问题日益受到关注。

Method: 首先构建数据生成过程的公式化描述，假设观测数据来自虚假和非虚假潜在变量。通过变分推断恢复这些变量，并利用它们训练奖励模型。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效缓解了虚假相关问题，产生了更鲁棒的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够理论识别非虚假潜在变量，并通过实践方法有效减轻奖励模型中的偏见，同时保持真实偏好因素。

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从多任务专家演示中学习参数化技能，以显著提高对未见任务的泛化能力，并确保学到的技能具有时间扩展性、语义意义和适应性。

Method: 使用时序变分推理和信息论正则化方法，联合学习参数化技能策略和元策略，元策略在每个时间步选择适当的离散技能和连续参数。

Result: 在LIBERO和MetaWorld基准测试中，DEPS优于多任务和技能学习基线方法，并能发现可解释的参数化技能，如抓取物体的技能，其连续参数定义抓取位置。

Conclusion: DEPS能够有效发现参数化技能，提高泛化能力，并产生可解释的技能表示。

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的核心挑战，先前开发的Cobweb/4V模型在视觉领域表现出对灾难性遗忘的鲁棒性，本研究旨在探究这种稳定性的关键因素。

Method: 通过比较Cobweb/4V与神经网络基线（包括新提出的CobwebNN），在不同复杂度的数据集（MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、MedMNIST、CIFAR-10）上进行实验，测试三个假设：自适应结构重组、稀疏更新和信息理论学习。

Result: 实验表明自适应结构重组增强了学习可塑性，稀疏更新有助于减少干扰，信息理论学习过程能够在不回顾过去数据的情况下保留先验知识。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了缓解灾难性遗忘的机制，强调了基于概念和信息理论方法在构建稳定自适应持续学习系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质设计方法如RSO依赖单路径梯度下降，忽略了序列空间约束，限制了设计的多样性和可设计性

Method: 基于马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛(MCMC)框架，在连续logit空间中操作，结合梯度引导探索和蛋白质语言模型引导的跳跃，能量函数耦合AlphaFold2结构目标和ESM2序列先验

Result: 在蛋白质结合物设计任务中，RSS产生5倍可设计结构和2-3倍结构多样性，计算成本相同

Conclusion: RSS是高效探索蛋白质设计空间的原理性方法

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统台风集合预报系统计算成本高且难以完全表征大气非线性特征，需要开发更高效的AI预报方法。

Method: FuXi-ENS采用可学习扰动方案生成集合预报，并与ECMWF-ENS在2018年90个全球台风上进行系统性对比分析。

Result: FuXi-ENS在台风相关物理变量预测和路径预报方面优势明显，集合离散度更小，但强度预报仍低于观测值；动力学分析显示其能更好捕捉大尺度环流和暖核结构。

Conclusion: 可学习扰动方案有潜力提升台风预报技能，为基于AI的极端天气集合预报提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，通过将音频生成模型的潜在表示映射到人类可解释的声学概念来解释这些模型。该方法在连续和离散音频潜在空间上验证，并分析最先进的文本到音乐模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在语言模型中成功提取可解释特征，但应用于音频生成面临挑战：音频的密集性质需要压缩，这会模糊语义含义，且自动特征表征仍然有限。

Method: 在音频自编码器潜在空间上训练稀疏自编码器，然后学习从SAE特征到离散化声学属性（音高、振幅和音色）的线性映射。

Result: 实现了对AI音乐生成过程的可控操作和分析，揭示了声学属性在合成过程中如何出现。在DiffRhythm-VAE、EnCodec和WavTokenizer等音频潜在空间上验证了该方法。

Conclusion: 该框架可以扩展到视觉潜在空间生成模型的可解释分析，为理解生成模型提供了有效方法。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

Motivation: 理解自适应梯度方法（如Adam）相对于梯度下降对模型泛化的影响，特别是Adam的"丰富性偏好"特性及其对数据旋转的敏感性。

Method: 分析Adam在坐标方向预处理方案下的行为，研究数据旋转对其性能的影响，并采用重参数化方法使一阶方法对数据旋转具有等变性。

Result: 即使小的数据旋转也会使Adam失去丰富性偏好，收敛到远离贝叶斯最优决策边界的线性边界；重参数化方法能有效恢复Adam对丰富决策边界的偏好。

Conclusion: 自适应梯度方法对数据旋转敏感，但通过重参数化技术可以使其对旋转具有等变性，从而保持其丰富性偏好的优势。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理多分辨率数据，在无需大量训练数据的情况下实现准确的算子学习。

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合SHAP特征重要性和因果分析的创新故障检测框架，用于解决工业过程中复杂数据的故障检测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程产生的复杂数据给故障检测系统带来挑战，现有机器学习方法往往结果不透明或性能不佳。

Method: 使用田纳西伊士曼过程作为基准，首先应用SHAP识别关键过程特征，然后通过有向无环图进行因果分析来揭示故障传播机制。

Conclusion: 这种双重方法将预测能力与因果理解相结合，为复杂制造环境提供了强大且可解释的故障检测工具。

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种渐进式高秩权重更新方法，通过累积连续的低秩增量来构建高秩权重更新，克服传统LoRA的限制，实现更快的收敛和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，计算开销成为任务特定微调的主要瓶颈。虽然低秩适应(LoRA)通过将权重更新限制在低维子空间来降低计算成本，但这种限制会阻碍效果并减慢收敛速度。

Method: 通过累积连续的低秩增量来渐进式构建高秩权重更新。识别每个更新的最优低秩矩阵以最小化损失函数并接近全微调效果。通过适当缩放原始低秩矩阵的列来实现高效无缝优化。

Result: 在多达120亿参数的流行LLM上进行广泛数值测试，在自然语言理解、常识推理和数学问题解决等多样化任务上，相对于最先进的LoRA变体，表现出持续的性能提升和快速收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法通过渐进式高秩权重更新有效解决了传统LoRA的限制，在保持计算效率的同时实现了更好的性能和更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型训练虽然能产生低PDE残差，但需要进一步通过物理约束来正则化模型，提高生成场的物理合理性。

Method: 基于预训练扩散架构，采用残差公式，在训练目标中集成PDE损失项，通过有限差分近似有效平流-扩散平衡来强制物理一致性。

Result: 经验观察表明，传统扩散训练已能产生低PDE残差，而使用额外损失进行微调能进一步正则化模型并增强生成场的物理合理性。

Conclusion: 物理条件潜在扩散模型能有效提升大气数据降尺度生成结果的物理一致性，代码已开源供未来发展参考。

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

TL;DR: GIFT是一种新的强化学习框架，通过最小化隐式和显式奖励模型之间的差异来对齐LLMs，结合了GRPO的多响应生成、DPO的隐式奖励和UNA的隐显奖励对齐原则，将复杂奖励最大化问题转化为简单的MSE损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PPO和GRPO直接最大化累积奖励的方法存在训练不稳定、收敛慢、泛化差等问题，而离线方法如DPO和UNA缺乏探索能力。需要一种既保持在线探索又简化优化的对齐方法。

Method: 结合GRPO的在线多响应生成和归一化、DPO的隐式奖励公式、UNA的隐显奖励对齐原则，通过联合归一化隐式和显式奖励，将非凸优化问题转化为凸的MSE损失。

Result: 相比GRPO需要更少超参数、收敛更快、泛化更好且训练过拟合显著减少，在数学基准上实现了优越的推理和对齐性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: GIFT通过隐显奖励对齐成功简化了LLM对齐问题，在保持在线探索能力的同时实现了更稳定高效的训练和更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via
SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was
achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The
results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle
alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance
strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIP方法在回归任务中要么仅限于二元特征，要么在处理连续大规模数据时计算不可行。简单二值化连续特征会牺牲全局最优性并产生过深树。

Method: 将最优回归树训练重构为两阶段优化问题，提出RS-ORT算法，在树结构变量上进行分支，结合边界收紧技术和可分解上下界策略加速训练。

Result: 在多个回归基准测试中，RS-ORT在训练和测试性能上优于现有方法，在200万样本的连续特征数据集上，4小时内可获得保证的训练性能。

Conclusion: RS-ORT能够有效处理大规模连续特征数据，提供更简单树结构和更好泛化能力的全局最优回归树。

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然二元偏好数据在基础模型微调中很关键，但用户决策过程中的时间信息尚未被充分利用。响应时间可以反映偏好强度，具有重要价值。

Method: 提出结合响应时间和二元选择数据的新方法，使用证据积累漂移扩散模型，开发Neyman正交损失函数，实现理论最优收敛速率。

Conclusion: 整合响应时间信息可以显著改进偏好学习效果，在理论和实验上都证明了其优越性，特别是在样本效率方面有重大提升。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法主要关注成对因果关系，忽视了变量组（子系统）及其集体因果影响，需要开发能够发现组级因果关系的技术。

Method: 使用深度学习联合建模所有时间序列组的结构关系，对训练好的模型进行组级干预，然后通过模型不变性测试确定变量组间的因果链接。

Conclusion: 将组级干预应用于深度学习模型并结合不变性测试，能够有效揭示复杂因果结构，为神经科学和气候科学等领域提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

Method: 在理论分析基础上，在完整复杂度的GPT-3小架构上进行实验验证，训练时包含层归一化、跳跃连接和权重衰减等标准组件。

Result: 移除Query权重的简化模型在验证损失上与标准基线模型表现相当，证明了Query权重的冗余性。

Conclusion: Query权重在注意力机制中是冗余的，这一发现在大规模模型上值得进一步研究验证。

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the

Result: 相比STE，在DeiT Tiny/Small上提升1-8%准确率，ResNet 18/50提升1-2%，LLaMA模型提升1-22困惑度点；相比n-SPSA减少796倍计算量

Conclusion: FOGZO在量化感知预训练中实现了精度和训练时间之间的更好权衡

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能在不共享敏感数据的情况下协作训练模型，但仍容易受到梯度泄漏攻击的威胁，需要评估差分隐私机制的实际防御效果。

Method: 在模拟联邦学习环境中，使用不同隐私级别训练多个计算机视觉模型，然后分析从截获梯度中重建私有数据的质量。

Result: DP-SGD显著减轻了梯度泄漏攻击风险，但模型性能有所下降；PDP-SGD保持了强大的分类性能，但无法有效防御重建攻击。

Conclusion: 需要超越理论保证来实证评估隐私机制，特别是在分布式学习场景中，信息泄漏可能对数据安全和隐私构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

Motivation: 高维流动模型的集合模拟计算成本高昂，传统神经算子需要大量数据且难以泛化到3D流动。需要开发无需数据、计算高效的替代方法。

Method: 采用物理基础的架构，以初始条件、边界条件和强迫函数作为输入，直接输出解。结合数值方法和机器学习可扩展性。

Result: 在2D基准测试和3D测试案例中，该方法在精度上超越先前神经算子，对于集合模拟比传统数值求解器更高效，首次实现了三维Navier-Stokes方程的准确求解。

Conclusion: 该方法为端到端科学模拟和预测建立了实用的数据无关、高保真PDE替代模型路径。

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Conclusion: 使用数据驱动的多功能回声状态网络模型模拟生物动力学是可行且有效的。

Abstract: In this work, a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction-diffusion model has
been developed, combining excitable-system dynamics with diffusion processes
and sharing conceptual features with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Designed to
capture the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems, particularly
electrophysiological processes, the model was solved numerically to generate
time-series data. These data were subsequently used to train and evaluate an
Echo State Network (ESN), which successfully reproduced the system's dynamic
behavior. The results demonstrate that simulating biological dynamics using
data-driven, multifunctional ESN models is both feasible and effective.

### [148] [ChessQA: Evaluating Large Language Models for Chess Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23948)
*Qianfeng Wen,Zhenwei Tang,Ashton Anderson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ChessQA基准测试，用于全面评估大语言模型在象棋领域的理解能力，涵盖从基础规则到高级概念的五个任务类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM象棋能力评估缺乏系统性和全面性，难以准确衡量模型在不同规模、训练方法和架构下的象棋理解能力。

Method: 设计了包含五个任务类别的基准测试：结构理解、模式识别、短战术、局面判断和语义理解，对应象棋知识的不同抽象层次。

Result: 评估当代LLM发现所有五个类别都存在持续弱点，提供了按类别的结果和错误分析。

Conclusion: ChessQA提供了比简单走子质量评估更全面的象棋能力评估框架，支持动态更新和进一步研究。

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

*Scott Emmons,Roland S. Zimmermann,David K. Elson,Rohin Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种实用的方法来衡量思维链(CoT)的可监测性，包括可读性和覆盖度两个维度，并通过自动评分器提示让LLM能够计算现有CoT的可监测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链监测为AI安全提供了独特机会，但这种机会可能因训练实践或模型架构的变化而丧失。为了帮助保持可监测性，需要一种实用的测量方法。

Method: 开发了自动评分器提示，使任何有能力的LLM能够计算现有CoT的可读性（推理能否被人理解）和覆盖度（CoT是否包含人类产生最终输出所需的所有推理）。

Result: 在合成CoT退化上进行合理性检查后，应用于多个前沿模型的挑战性基准测试，发现它们表现出高可监测性。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于测量CoT的默认可监测性，应被视为对抗性压力测试的补充，而非替代品，用于测试针对故意规避模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

Abstract: The proliferation of probabilistic AI has promoted proposals for specialized
stochastic computers. Despite promising efficiency gains, these proposals have
failed to gain traction because they rely on fundamentally limited modeling
techniques and exotic, unscalable hardware. In this work, we address these
shortcomings by proposing an all-transistor probabilistic computer that
implements powerful denoising models at the hardware level. A system-level
analysis indicates that devices based on our architecture could achieve
performance parity with GPUs on a simple image benchmark using approximately
10,000 times less energy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型的文本嵌入在所有扩散时间步中保持固定，限制了其对生成过程的适应性。

Method: 提出扩散自适应文本嵌入（DATE），在每个扩散时间步基于中间扰动数据动态更新文本嵌入，通过优化问题推导更新规则。

Result: DATE在保持模型生成能力的同时，在多概念生成和文本引导图像编辑等任务中提供了优于固定文本嵌入的文本-图像对齐。

Conclusion: DATE方法能够在不需额外训练的情况下，通过动态调整文本条件来显著提升扩散模型的文本-图像对齐效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

TL;DR: SynCast是一个高分辨率神经网络预测模型，通过整合气象和空气成分数据，提高对平均和极端污染水平的预测准确性，特别针对野火、城市雾霾和沙尘暴等事件引发的污染峰值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是全球主要健康和环境风险，现有模型往往低估罕见但危险的污染事件。需要更准确的颗粒物浓度预测来支持及时的公共卫生预警和干预。

Method: 基于区域适应的transformer架构，结合扩散基随机精化模块，利用ERA5和CAMS数据集，采用领域感知目标和极值理论指导的损失函数。

Result: 模型在多个PM变量（PM1、PM2.5、PM10）预测上表现出显著改进，特别是在极端条件下，在不影响全局准确性的前提下显著提升了高影响区域的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代空气质量早期预警系统提供了可扩展的基础，支持脆弱区域的气候健康风险缓解。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

TL;DR: 提出了谱变换网络(STNet)，通过谱变换技术改进算子特征值问题的深度学习求解方法，利用近似特征值和特征函数对原始算子进行变换，包含收缩投影和滤波变换两种技术，显著提升了求解精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算子特征值问题在科学和工程中很重要，但传统数值方法受维度诅咒限制。现有深度学习方法性能依赖于算子谱分布，较大的特征值间隙能提高精度，因此需要利用谱分布的定制化谱变换来提升性能。

Method: STNet在每次迭代中使用近似特征值和特征函数对原始算子进行谱变换，将其转化为等价但更易求解的问题。采用收缩投影排除已求解特征函数对应的子空间，减少搜索空间；使用滤波变换放大目标区域的特征值并抑制外部特征值。

Result: 大量实验表明STNet始终优于现有的基于学习的方法，在精度方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 谱变换网络通过谱变换技术有效解决了算子特征值问题的维度诅咒问题，结合收缩投影和滤波变换显著提升了深度学习方法的求解精度和性能。

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

Motivation: 组合老虎机扩展了经典老虎机框架，学习者在每轮选择多个臂，应用于在线推荐和品类优化等场景。虽然UCB算法自然扩展到此场景，但臂消除方法的适应更具挑战性。

Method: 引入新颖的消除方案，将臂分为确认、活跃和消除三类，并加入显式探索来更新这些集合。该方法适用于组合多臂老虎机的一般图反馈和组合线性上下文老虎机两种设置。

Result: 该算法在两种设置中都实现了接近最优的遗憾界，而基于UCB的方法由于缺乏足够的显式探索可能被证明会失败。同时提供了匹配的下界。

Conclusion: 提出的消除算法在组合老虎机中有效解决了UCB方法的局限性，通过显式探索实现了接近最优的性能，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络的精度严重依赖于配置点的放置。全局采样覆盖整个域但计算昂贵，局部采样效率高但可能忽略已学习区域，降低鲁棒性。需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 采用全局-局部融合采样策略，通过用与残差成反比的高斯噪声扰动训练点来生成新配置点，集中在困难区域同时保持探索。引入轻量级线性代理来近似全局残差分布以减少计算开销。

Result: 在基准PDE上的广泛实验表明，GLF相比全局和局部采样策略，在精度和效率方面都有持续改进。

Conclusion: 该研究为增强PINNs在解决复杂和高维PDE中的可靠性和效率提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

TL;DR: 提出Two-Stage LKPLO多阶段异常检测框架，结合广义损失函数、核PCA和局部聚类，在复杂数据结构上实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于投影的异常检测方法依赖固定统计指标和假设单一数据结构的局限性

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 广义损失函数PLO替代固定指标；2) 全局核PCA线性化非线性结构；3) 局部聚类处理多模态分布

Result: 在10个基准数据集上通过5折交叉验证和自动超参数优化，显著优于基线方法，特别是在多聚类和复杂高维数据上表现突出

Conclusion: 该框架为重要类别的异常检测问题提供了强大工具，并强调了混合多阶段架构的重要性

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过因果解耦学习来减少无监督域自适应中负迁移的方法RED，通过对抗训练分离因果特征和环境特征，并减少环境特征引起的判别分歧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督域自适应中由于领域偏移导致的负迁移问题，特别是非因果环境特征在不同域间引起的判别分歧。

Method: 提出RED方法，通过对抗训练域特定的环境特征提取器，将样本解耦为域不变因果特征和域特定环境特征，然后估计并减少环境分歧。

Result: 实验结果表明RED能有效缓解负迁移，并达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过因果解耦学习减少环境分歧是解决负迁移问题的有效途径，RED方法在理论和实验上都证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: CA-GAN是一个专门为表格数据设计的因果感知生成对抗网络框架，通过因果图提取和条件WGAN-GP生成器，结合强化学习目标，在保持数据效用和隐私的同时捕捉复杂因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格数据生成方法（特别是基于GAN的方法）在捕捉复杂因果关系、保持数据效用和提供可证明的隐私保证方面存在不足，限制了在真实企业环境中的部署。

Method: 采用两步法：1）因果图提取学习数据流形中的因果关系；2）基于因果图结构的条件WGAN-GP生成器，结合强化学习目标对齐真实和生成数据的因果图。

Result: 在14个表格数据集上优于6种最先进方法，在因果保持、效用保持和隐私保持三个核心数据工程指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: CA-GAN为数据工程师提供了一个实用、高性能的解决方案，能够创建高质量、符合隐私要求的合成数据集，用于数据库系统基准测试、软件开发加速和安全数据驱动研究。

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

TL;DR: 提出检索增强预测（RAP）框架，结合深度学习预测能力和历史数据真实演化，通过检索相似历史样本作为动态指导，改善长期自回归预测中的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在复杂物理系统长期时空预测中的局限性，特别是自回归推演过程中误差累积导致物理不合理的问题。

Method: RAP框架：1）从大规模数据库中检索与当前状态最相似的历史样本；2）将该样本的真实未来演化作为参考目标；3）使用双流架构将参考目标作为条件输入，提供动态指导。

Result: 在气象学、湍流和火灾模拟等基准测试中，RAP超越了最先进方法，显著优于仅使用类比预测的基线方法，生成更物理真实的预测，有效抑制长期推演中的误差发散。

Conclusion: RAP框架通过结合参数化深度学习和非参数化历史数据，为复杂物理系统的长期时空预测提供了更可靠和物理合理的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

TL;DR: FolDE是一种主动学习辅助定向进化方法，通过自然性预热启动和恒定谎言批量选择器，在蛋白质优化中比现有方法发现更多优质突变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统蛋白质优化方法成本高昂，现有ALDE方法在选择最高预测突变体时会产生同质化训练数据，影响后续预测模型的准确性。

Method: FolDE采用自然性预热启动（利用蛋白质语言模型输出增强有限活性测量）和恒定谎言批量选择器（提高批量多样性）来最大化最终成功率。

Result: 在20个蛋白质靶点的模拟中，FolDE比最佳基线ALDE方法多发现23%的前10%突变体（p=0.005），找到前1%突变体的可能性高55%。

Conclusion: FolDE通过改进的预热启动和批量选择策略，显著提高了蛋白质优化的效率，并作为开源软件提供给所有实验室使用。

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

TL;DR: FALQON是一个消除FP8量化LoRA训练中量化开销的框架，通过直接合并LoRA适配器到FP8量化主干中，实现3倍训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8量化主要对大型矩阵乘法有加速效果，但在LoRA这种使用小维度矩阵的高效微调方法中，固有的量化开销会削弱加速效果。

Method: 提出FALQON框架，直接合并LoRA适配器到FP8量化主干中，重新制定前向和反向计算以减少量化开销，并引入行级代理更新机制。

Result: 实验评估显示FALQON比现有量化LoRA方法实现约3倍训练加速，同时保持相似的准确度水平。

Conclusion: FALQON提供了一个实用的大规模模型高效微调解决方案，其端到端FP8工作流程无需后训练量化，便于高效部署。

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

Motivation: 受高斯设置中I-MMSE恒等式的启发，希望在离散设置中建立类似的理论框架，为离散扩散模型提供原则性的对数似然估计方法。

Method: 推导了信息-最小去噪分数熵(I-MDSE)关系和信息-最小去噪交叉熵(I-MDCE)关系，将互信息与分数匹配损失联系起来，提供了对数似然的时间积分分解。

Result: 实验在合成和真实数据上验证了估计器的准确性、方差稳定性和实用性，证明DSE和DCE损失不仅是变分界，而且是对数似然的紧致估计器。

Conclusion: 该框架为离散扩散模型提供了原则性的对数似然估计方法，支持时间无关公式、条件似然估计和耦合蒙特卡洛估计等实用扩展。

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了视觉语言模型中的上下文学习能力，发现当前VLM主要依赖文本线索而未能有效整合视觉信息，揭示了多模态上下文学习的关键局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在大语言模型中已被广泛研究，但在视觉语言模型中的有效性仍未被充分探索，需要系统评估VLM的多模态上下文学习能力。

Method: 评估了四种架构的七个视觉语言模型在三个图像描述基准上的表现，分析了提示设计、架构选择和训练策略的影响，并首次分析了VLM注意力模式随上下文演示数量增加的变化。

Result: 训练图像-文本交错数据能提升ICL性能但不保证有效整合视觉和文本信息；指令调优改善指令跟随但减少对上下文演示的依赖；当前VLM主要关注文本线索而未能利用视觉信息。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态上下文学习方面存在显著局限性，需要增强其从多模态上下文示例中学习的能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

Method: 提出图引导概念选择(G2ConS)，包含块选择方法和独立于LLM的概念图，前者选择重要文档块，后者填补知识缺口

Result: 在多个真实数据集上评估，G2ConS在构建成本、检索效果和回答质量方面均优于所有基线方法

Conclusion: G2ConS通过有效减少LLM调用次数，实现了图基RAG方法在成本效益和性能上的显著提升

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

<details>

Motivation: 复杂耗散系统在科学和工程中普遍存在，但远离平衡态时能量耗散和时间不可逆性难以从数据中量化。学习准确且可解释的动力学模型面临挑战：模型需要足够表达能力描述不同过程，又需要足够约束保持物理意义和数学可识别性。

Method: I-OnsagerNet扩展Onsager原理，保证学习到的势能从稳态密度获得，漂移项可清晰分解为时间可逆和时间不可逆分量（如Helmholtz分解所要求）。该方法能够计算熵产生并量化不可逆性。

Result: 应用于聚合物拉伸流和随机梯度Langevin动力学，揭示了新的见解：势垒高度随应变率呈超线性缩放，熵产生率呈亚线性缩放，以及不可逆性随批量大小增加而抑制。

Conclusion: I-OnsagerNet建立了一个通用的数据驱动框架，用于发现和解释非平衡动力学。

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid
dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale
turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy

generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

TL;DR: SPEAR++改进了SPEAR攻击，通过应用稀疏字典学习技术，使联邦学习中线性层ReLU激活的梯度反演变得可行，将可处理的批次大小提升了10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度反演攻击缺乏理论保证，SPEAR攻击虽然理论突破但受限于指数级时间复杂度，无法处理大批次数据。

Method: 应用最先进的稀疏字典学习技术来解决线性层ReLU激活的梯度反演问题。

Result: SPEAR++保持了SPEAR的所有优点（对DP噪声和FedAvg聚合的鲁棒性），同时可处理10倍大的批次大小。

Conclusion: SPEAR++显著提升了梯度反演攻击的实用性，使联邦学习的隐私保护特性面临更严峻挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

TL;DR: SPARK是一个物理引导的定量增强插件，通过重建自编码器将物理参数整合到物理丰富的离散状态字典中，在潜在空间进行插值生成物理上合理的新训练样本，并与傅里叶增强图ODE结合进行下游预测。


<details>

Motivation: 传统数值方法计算成本高，现代数据驱动方法面临数据稀缺和分布偏移问题，需要克服这些基本限制。

Method: 使用重建自编码器构建物理丰富的离散状态字典，在潜在空间进行原则性插值生成新训练样本，结合傅里叶增强图ODE进行预测建模。

Conclusion: 物理引导的增强范式在解决数据稀缺和分布偏移问题上具有显著效果，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

Motivation: ICU数据中生命体征测量存在大量缺失段，影响机器学习预测性能，而现有插补方法比较不足，实践中仍使用可能降低预测准确性的临时插补技术。

Method: 建立包含15种插补方法和4种截断方法的可扩展基准，在主要ICU数据集上进行基准测试，比较不同插补技术的效果。

Result: 提供了不同插补方法的比较结果，为研究人员选择最准确的插补技术提供指导。

Conclusion: 该基准为ICU数据插补提供了比较基础，有助于促进更多机器学习模型进入临床实践。

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

<details>

Motivation: 深度生成模型常在敏感数据上训练，存在隐私泄露风险，现有方法主要依赖全局标准评估隐私风险，缺乏样本级别的可解释性评估方法。

Method: 使用极值统计方法分析最近邻距离，开发了PRIVET算法，该算法与数据模态无关，能够为每个合成样本计算个体隐私泄露分数。

Result: PRIVET在各种数据模态下都能可靠检测记忆化和隐私泄露，包括高维数据、小样本遗传数据，甚至在欠拟合情况下也有效。相比现有方法，PRIVET在提供数据集级别和样本级别评估方面具有优势。

Conclusion: PRIVET提供了一种有效的样本级别隐私风险评估方法，填补了现有隐私评估方法的空白，有助于合成数据在实际应用中的安全部署。

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

Motivation: 现有稀疏线性赌博机算法只能在数据丰富机制或数据匮乏机制中单独达到最优性能，无法同时适应两种机制。稀疏IDS算法虽然能在贝叶斯设置下实现这种适应性，但需要贝叶斯假设

Method: 使用稀疏乐观信息导向采样(SOIDS)算法，通过引入时间依赖的学习率，在无需贝叶斯假设的最坏情况下平衡信息获取和遗憾最小化

Result: SOIDS算法在理论上证明了能够同时实现数据丰富和数据匮乏两种机制下的最优最坏情况遗憾界，并通过实验验证了其良好性能

Conclusion: SOIDS扩展了IDS的理论保证，提供了第一个在无需贝叶斯假设的情况下，同时实现两种机制最优性能的算法

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the data-poor
regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the number of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algorithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, providing the first algorithm
that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the data-rich
and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good performance of
SOIDS.

TL;DR: 提出PaTaRM框架，通过整合偏好感知奖励机制和动态标准适应，解决了传统奖励模型在RLHF中的局限性，实现了高效、可泛化且可解释的奖励建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对奖励模型依赖二元标签导致推理不匹配，点对方法需要复杂标注且适应性差。需要一种统一框架来整合相对偏好信息并动态适应任务需求。

Method: PaTaRM结合偏好感知奖励机制和动态标准适应系统，利用成对数据构建点对训练信号，无需显式点对标签，同时为全局任务一致性和实例特定推理生成评估标准。

Result: 在RewardBench和RMBench上平均相对提升4.7%，在IFEval和InFoBench基准测试中下游RLHF性能平均提升13.6%。

Conclusion: PaTaRM提供了一种高效、可泛化且可解释的奖励建模解决方案，显著提升了RLHF性能。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的扩展框架成功结合了准确性和可解释性，实体类别集成和LLM驱动的类别生成方法为时序知识图谱预测提供了透明且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALS框架通过将KV缓存投影到紧凑的潜在空间，并在该空间中进行稀疏token选择，有效解决了LLM长上下文推理中的KV缓存压缩问题，避免了RoPE机制带来的重构开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文时面临KV缓存过大和内存带宽要求高的问题，而现有的低秩压缩方法由于RoPE机制会导致严重的精度下降或新的速度瓶颈。

Method: 提出SALS框架：将KV缓存通过低秩投影到紧凑潜在空间，在该空间中使用无RoPE的查询-键交互进行稀疏token选择，仅重构重要token子集。

Result: 在多个模型上验证，SALS实现了6.4倍KV缓存压缩和5.7倍注意力算子加速，端到端吞吐量在4K和32K序列上分别提升1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: SALS通过潜在空间稀疏注意力机制，在保持竞争性精度的同时实现了显著的KV缓存压缩和推理加速，是处理长上下文LLM推理的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方程发现在回归任务中已取得显著成功，但缺乏针对分类任务的专门方法。本文旨在将方程发现技术扩展到二元分类领域，寻找可解释的决策边界函数。

Method: 提出EDC框架，使用适度复杂度的语法来发现决策边界函数。语法包含求和项，包括线性、二次、指数项以及特征乘积项（产生双曲线以捕捉XOR类依赖关系）。

Result: 在人工和真实数据上的广泛实验表明，EDC能够发现目标方程的结构和参数值，在二元分类中优于现有ED方法，性能与最先进分类方法相当。

Conclusion: EDC为二元分类提供了一种新的可解释方法，其语法复杂度可配置，特别适合包含领域特定表达式的场景，在保持灵活性的同时避免过拟合。

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

Motivation: 贝叶斯聚类能处理不确定性但计算成本高，且现实数据集常包含缺失值，简单插补会忽略不确定性导致结果不理想。

Method: 扩展先验数据拟合网络(PFNs)到无监督贝叶斯聚类，使用Transformer架构，在有限高斯混合模型先验生成的合成数据集上训练。

Result: 比AIC、BIC和变分推断等手工模型选择方法更准确估计聚类数量，聚类质量与变分推断相当但速度快几个数量级，在高缺失率的真实基因组数据集上优于插补基线方法。

Conclusion: Cluster-PFN能够提供可扩展且灵活的贝叶斯聚类解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

Motivation: 传统方法将感知和决策耦合在一起训练，这可能导致感知质量不佳。PeL旨在分离感知和决策学习，专注于优化感知属性本身。

Method: 定义感知属性独立于目标任务或重参数化，使用任务无关信号优化感官接口，并通过表示不变性指标评估感知质量。

Result: 证明了PeL更新在保持足够不变性的情况下与贝叶斯任务风险梯度正交，并提供了一套任务无关的评估指标来认证感知质量。

Conclusion: PeL提供了一个系统化的框架来分离感知和决策学习，能够独立优化感知属性，为构建更鲁棒的智能体系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗等高风险领域应用时，常常忽略不确定性，即使置信度低也提供预测，这会影响预测的可靠性

Method: 采用两阶段方法：训练阶段使用实例硬度过滤问题实例优化数据集；推理阶段引入置信度拒绝机制，只保留可靠预测

Result: 在三个真实医疗数据集上的评估表明，该方法能有效提升模型可靠性，同时平衡预测性能和拒绝率

Conclusion: 实例硬度过滤与置信度拒绝相结合的方法为安全关键应用中的机器学习系统部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

Motivation: 合成数据虽然能解决智能卡数据在公共交通研究中的隐私和可访问性问题，但现有评估方法零散，缺乏对群体层面变化和任务特定效用的考虑，不清楚合成数据的可靠性、安全性和实用性。

Method: 提出了RPU框架，在三个互补维度（代表性、隐私、效用）和三个层次（记录、群体、总体）上系统评估合成出行数据，整合一致的指标量化相似性、披露风险和实际有用性。

Result: 对12种代表性生成方法进行基准测试，结果显示合成数据不天然保证隐私，不存在"一刀切"模型，隐私与代表性/效用之间存在明显权衡，CTGAN提供最平衡的权衡。

Conclusion: RPU框架为研究人员和从业者提供了系统可复现的基础，用于比较合成数据生成技术并在公共交通应用中选择合适方法。

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了APEX协议，用于在计算预算有限的情况下，对组合合成库进行近似但全面的虚拟筛选，利用神经网络代理模型实现快速枚举和近似top-k化合物检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的组合合成库规模庞大（数十亿化合物），但虚拟筛选通常只能评估不到0.1%的化合物，导致许多高分化合物未被发现。同时，筛选目标和约束条件在过程中经常变化，现有算法缺乏复用性。

Method: APEX使用神经网络代理模型，利用组合合成库的结构特性来预测目标和约束条件，使得在消费级GPU上能在1分钟内完成全枚举，实现近似top-k集合的精确检索。

Result: 开发了包含1000多万化合物的基准CSL，标注了5个医学相关靶点的对接分数和理化性质。APEX在检索准确性和运行时间方面均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: APEX协议能够高效处理大规模组合合成库的虚拟筛选问题，在有限计算预算下实现近似但全面的搜索，为药物发现提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种使用少量成功演示来初始化强化学习智能体价值函数的简单有效方法，通过在稀疏奖励环境中提供有用的动作先验来减少探索负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏奖励环境中的强化学习面临缺乏信息反馈的挑战，需要解决探索效率低下的问题。

Method: 使用离线演示预计算价值估计，并将其作为早期学习目标，然后通过标准在线交互进行精炼，形成离线到在线的混合范式。

Result: 在基准任务上的实验表明，该方法加速了收敛，即使使用最少或次优的演示数据也优于标准基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了稀疏奖励设置中的样本效率，通过演示初始化价值函数是一种有效的策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

Abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet
existing research often relies on outdated datasets, non-reproducible
preprocessing pipelines, and limited coverage of clinical interventions. We
introduce MIMIC-Sepsis, a curated cohort and benchmark framework derived from
the MIMIC-IV database, designed to support reproducible modeling of sepsis
trajectories. Our cohort includes 35,239 ICU patients with time-aligned
clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock
onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating
treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for
evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.

Conclusion: 提出的数据感知LoRA初始化理论框架和LoRA-DA算法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为LoRA初始化提供了理论基础和实用解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

Motivation: 标准直接预测方法在存在标签自相关时，条件负对数似然的估计存在偏差，影响预测模型训练效果。

Result: 实验表明DistDF提升了多种预测模型的性能，并达到了最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: DistDF通过替代最小化条件分布间的差异，有效解决了标签自相关导致的估计偏差问题，显著提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Conclusion: 量子启发方法与经典架构的结合能够开发轻量级、高性能且可解释的预测模型，推动QML超越当前限制的适用性。

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current
limitations.

Conclusion: 该框架成功克服了传统二元标签的局限性，能够捕捉中间退化状态，DTC-VAE方法在健康指标一致性方面表现最佳。

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

Conclusion: 稳健记忆的参数复杂度取决于稳健比ρ，这为理解神经网络稳健性提供了新的理论洞见

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

### [203] [Greedy Sampling Is Provably Efficient for RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24700)
*Di Wu,Chengshuai Shi,Jing Yang,Cong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）的理论基础，发现在一般偏好模型下，直接使用经验估计（贪婪采样）就能获得优于现有方法的性能保证，这与之前需要构造乐观或悲观估计的方法形成对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF已成为训练大型语言模型的关键技术，但理论理解有限。现有研究主要关注基于奖励的Bradley-Terry偏好模型，而本文考虑更一般的偏好模型，旨在获得更好的性能保证。

Method: 采用直接使用经验估计的贪婪采样方法，而不是构造乐观或悲观估计。该方法基于KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构特性。

Result: 在一般偏好模型下获得了比现有方法有数量级提升的性能保证，并特别针对BT模型证明了贪婪采样的充分性。

Conclusion: 贪婪采样在RLHF中是足够的，这一发现源于KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构特性，为RLHF的理论理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

TL;DR: Game-TARS是一个通用游戏智能体，使用统一、可扩展的键盘鼠标动作空间进行训练，在大规模跨领域预训练中表现出色，在多个游戏基准测试中超越现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有游戏智能体在异构领域（操作系统、网页、模拟游戏）中缺乏通用性的问题，开发一个能够通过人类对齐的键盘鼠标输入进行大规模持续预训练的通用智能体。

Method: 采用统一可扩展的动作空间，基于人类键盘鼠标输入；使用衰减持续损失减少因果混淆；实施稀疏思维策略平衡推理深度和推理成本；在5000亿个token的多样化轨迹和多模态数据上进行预训练。

Result: 在开放世界Minecraft任务中成功率是之前最先进模型的2倍；在未见过的网页3D游戏中接近人类新手水平；在FPS基准测试中超越GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Claude-4-Sonnet；缩放实验证实统一动作空间在跨游戏和多模态数据扩展时持续改进。

Conclusion: 简单可扩展的动作表示结合大规模预训练为开发具有广泛计算机使用能力的通用智能体提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified,
scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs.
Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale
continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and
simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse
trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual
loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that
balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS
achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨人工智能在科学问题解决中的作用，重点关注其对学科创造力的影响。通过区分创造性方法和创造性产品，引入学科创造力的概念，并通过数学案例说明AI可能取代而非扩展学科创造力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI在科学问题解决中的角色，特别关注其对学科创造力的潜在影响，探讨AI可能如何改变科学追求的价值。

Method: 基于创造力哲学理论，区分创造性方法和创造性产品，提出学科创造力的概念，并通过两个数学案例进行分析。

Result: 研究发现，虽然计算可以扩展学科创造力，但某些涉及AI的方法可能会取代学科创造力，这种取代有可能改变（甚至削弱）科学追求的价值。

Conclusion: AI在科学问题解决中对学科创造力具有双重影响——既能扩展也可能取代，这种取代可能对科学追求的价值产生负面影响。

Abstract: This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in scientific
problem-solving, with a focus on its implications for disciplinary creativity.
Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between
creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of
disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific
expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in
mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity,
certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has
the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific
pursuit.

*Eline M. Bovy,Caleb Probine,Marnix Suilen,Ufuk Topcu,Nils Jansen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了多环境POMDP（ME-POMDP）和对抗信念POMDP（AB-POMDP）模型，用于处理具有离散模型不确定性的POMDP问题，并开发了精确和近似的点基算法来计算鲁棒策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当多个领域专家对问题建模存在分歧时，需要一种能够处理模型不确定性的POMDP框架，目标是找到在所有可能POMDP模型中都表现良好的单一鲁棒策略。

Method: 将ME-POMDP推广到具有初始信念集合的AB-POMDP，证明任意ME-POMDP可以简化为仅变化转移和奖励函数或仅变化观测和奖励函数的模型，同时保持最优策略。开发了精确和近似的点基算法。

Result: 能够在标准POMDP基准测试的多环境扩展中计算鲁棒策略，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ME-POMDP和AB-POMDP为处理模型不确定性提供了有效的框架，所开发的算法能够计算在所有可能环境中最坏情况下表现最优的策略。

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究利用大型语言模型(LLMs)发现新的启发式算法来解决单机总延迟调度问题，开发了EDDC和MDDC两种算法，在大型实例上表现优于传统启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统启发式算法在单机总延迟调度问题上表现有限，而精确方法在大规模实例中计算不可行，需要开发更有效的启发式算法。

Method: 利用LLMs发现新的启发式算法EDDC和MDDC，基于经典的EDD和MDD规则，并与混合整数规划和动态规划等精确方法进行比较。

Result: 对于超过100个作业的实例，EDDC改进了经典EDD规则，MDDC始终优于传统启发式方法，在大型复杂实例上与精确方法竞争。

Conclusion: 人-LLM协作可以产生可扩展的高性能启发式算法，用于NP难约束组合优化问题，即使在资源有限的情况下也能有效配置。

Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization
literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large
Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)
problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a
single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We
develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger
(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date
(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that
employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered
algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time
derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare
their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across
various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than
100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become
computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD
rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently
outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact
approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows
that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics
for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited
resources when effectively configured.

### [208] [Policy Cards: Machine-Readable Runtime Governance for Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24383)
*Juraj Mavračić*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Policy Cards是一种机器可读的部署层标准，用于表达AI代理的操作、监管和伦理约束，作为代理的组成部分在运行时执行约束要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有透明度工具如模型卡、数据卡等缺乏规范层来编码具体的允许/拒绝规则、义务和合规要求，无法为自主AI代理提供可验证的合规性。

Method: 开发Policy Cards框架，定义规范层来编码允许/拒绝规则、义务、证据要求和与NIST AI RMF、ISO/IEC 42001、欧盟AI法案等保证框架的映射关系。

Result: 每个Policy Card可以自动验证、版本控制，并链接到运行时执行或持续审计管道，为自主代理提供可验证的合规性，在多代理生态系统中形成分布式保证基础。

Conclusion: Policy Cards提供了将高级治理与工程实践相结合的实际机制，实现了大规模的可问责自主性。

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于测试时调优的框架，利用预训练transformer模型直接从串联质谱和分子式进行端到端的从头分子结构生成，无需数据库匹配或中间步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖数据库匹配或需要中间碎片/指纹预测的多步骤流程，难以识别参考数据库中不存在的化合物。

Method: 通过测试时调优增强预训练transformer模型，直接从串联质谱和分子式生成分子结构，无需人工标注和中间步骤。

Result: 在NPLIB1和MassSpecGym两个基准测试上分别比现有最佳方法DiffMS提升100%和20%，测试时调优在MassSpecGym上比传统微调提升62%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够动态适应新质谱数据，即使预测与真实值有偏差，生成的分子候选结构仍然准确，为人工解释和可靠识别提供有价值指导。

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现实世界法律实验成本高或不可行，利用AI系统模拟法律社会成为验证和发展法律理论的有效替代方案。LLM凭借其世界知识和角色扮演能力，是构建法律社会模拟的强有力候选技术。

Method: 引入Law in Silico框架，基于LLM构建智能体来模拟法律场景，包含个体决策机制和制度机制（立法、裁决、执行）。通过比较模拟犯罪率与现实数据来验证框架有效性。

Result: 实验表明LLM智能体能够很大程度上重现宏观层面的犯罪趋势，并提供与现实观察一致的见解。微观层面模拟显示，功能良好、透明且适应性的法律系统能更好地保护弱势个体的权利。

Conclusion: LLM能够有效模拟法律系统，不仅重现宏观犯罪模式，还揭示了透明适应性法律体系对弱势群体保护的重要性，为法律理论发展和实践应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

TL;DR: 提出两种架构模式：DOM转换模式和超媒体功能识别模式，用于从结构化数据构建软件代理的世界模型，解决HTML冗长和API集成僵化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件代理的自主性依赖于从结构化数据构建可操作的世界模型，但面临两个关键挑战：原始HTML的冗长性使基础模型难以直接处理，硬编码API集成的静态特性阻碍代理适应不断发展的服务。

Method: DOM转换模式将冗长的原始DOM提炼为紧凑、任务相关的世界模型表示；超媒体功能识别模式通过解析标准化语义描述，在运行时动态发现和集成未知Web服务的能力。

Result: 这两种模式共同提供了一个稳健的框架，使代理能够高效构建和维护准确的世界模型。

Conclusion: 该模式语言为工程化代理提供了可扩展、自适应和可互操作的自动化能力，适用于Web及其扩展资源。

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

TL;DR: 病理学基础模型在癌症诊断、预后和多模态检索方面表现不佳，存在诊断准确率低、鲁棒性差、几何不稳定性、计算需求大和安全漏洞等问题，需要从根本上重新思考该范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型在计算机视觉和语言处理领域取得了突破，但在计算病理学中的快速应用并未带来预期的突破，反而暴露了根本性弱点。

Method: 通过系统评估分析病理学基础模型的缺陷，识别出七个相互关联的原因。

Result: 发现当前病理学基础模型在诊断准确性、鲁棒性、几何稳定性、计算效率和安全方面存在严重问题。

Conclusion: 病理学基础模型与组织形态学的本质存在概念上的不匹配，需要从根本上重新思考建模范式。

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCAP是一个用于大语言模型的递归上下文感知推理和规划框架，通过计划提前分解、结构化父计划重注入和内存高效执行三个关键机制，显著提升了长时程任务的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的顺序提示方法容易产生上下文漂移、目标信息丢失和循环失败问题，而分层提示方法则存在跨级连续性弱或运行时开销大的缺陷。

Method: ReCAP结合三个关键机制：(1) 计划提前分解：生成完整子任务列表，执行第一项并优化剩余；(2) 结构化父计划重注入：在递归返回时保持多级上下文一致性；(3) 内存高效执行：限制活动提示，使成本随任务深度线性扩展。

Result: 实验表明ReCAP在各种长时程推理基准测试中显著提升了子目标对齐和成功率，在严格pass@1协议下，同步Robotouille提升32%，异步Robotouille提升29%。

Conclusion: ReCAP框架通过将高层目标与低层动作对齐、减少冗余提示以及保持跨递归的连贯上下文更新，有效解决了长时程任务中的多步推理和动态重规划挑战。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Abstract: While Generative AI rapidly advances in various domains, generating truly
creative, aesthetic, and counter-intuitive outputs remains a challenge. This
paper presents an approach to tackle these difficulties in the domain of chess
puzzles. We start by benchmarking Generative AI architectures, and then
introduce an RL framework with novel rewards based on chess engine search
statistics to overcome some of those shortcomings. The rewards are designed to
enhance a puzzle's uniqueness, counter-intuitiveness, diversity, and realism.
Our RL approach dramatically increases counter-intuitive puzzle generation by
10x, from 0.22\% (supervised) to 2.5\%, surpassing existing dataset rates
(2.1\%) and the best Lichess-trained model (0.4\%). Our puzzles meet novelty
and diversity benchmarks, retain aesthetic themes, and are rated by human
experts as more creative, enjoyable, and counter-intuitive than composed book
puzzles, even approaching classic compositions. Our final outcome is a curated
booklet of these AI-generated puzzles, which is acknowledged for creativity by
three world-renowned experts.

Abstract: This work investigates the use of digital twins for dynamical system modeling
and control, integrating physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid approaches with
both traditional and AI-driven controllers. Using a miniature greenhouse as a
test platform, four predictive models Linear, Physics-Based Modeling (PBM),
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM) are
developed and compared under interpolation and extrapolation scenarios. Three
control strategies Model Predictive Control (MPC), Reinforcement Learning (RL),
and Large Language Model (LLM) based control are also implemented to assess
trade-offs in precision, adaptability, and implementation effort. Results show
that in modeling HAM provides the most balanced performance across accuracy,

TL;DR: 提出基于摊销变分推理的可扩展训练算法，通过多样性强化学习和贝叶斯推理扩展策略，提升大视觉语言模型的推理能力、泛化性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练算法（SFT、PPO、GRPO）在未见推理任务上泛化能力不足，且严重依赖有偏的奖励模型，需要改进推理训练方法。

Method: 将LVLMs推理重新表述为后验推理，采用摊销变分推理框架，引入稀疏奖励函数鼓励多样化高似然潜在思维链，并用边际似然替代昂贵搜索方法。

Result: 在七个推理基准测试中提升了最先进LVLMs的性能，在有效性、泛化性和可解释性方面均有改进。

Conclusion: 该方法通过变分推理和多样性强化学习，有效解决了现有推理训练的局限性，为LVLMs提供了更可靠的推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Method: 提出了OS-Sentinel混合安全检测框架，结合形式化验证器检测显式系统级违规和基于VLM的上下文判断器评估上下文风险和代理行为。

Result: 实验表明OS-Sentinel在多个指标上比现有方法提升了10%-30%。

Conclusion: 该研究为移动代理安全研究奠定了基础，并为开发更安全可靠的自主移动代理提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中因果效应依赖于具体情境（如年龄、国家、剂量等），需要形式化处理这种情境依赖性。

Method: 结合judo calculus与标准得分、约束和梯度因果发现方法，使用Lawvere-Tierney模态算子j选择相关情境，在情境覆盖上证明因果主张。

Result: 实验结果显示层理论因果发现的去中心化特性带来计算效率提升，性能优于经典因果发现方法。

Conclusion: judo calculus为处理情境依赖的因果发现提供了形式化框架，在计算效率和性能上均有优势。

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

*Aymane El Gadarri,Ali Aouad,Vivek F. Farias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为sign estimator的新方法，通过将交叉熵损失替换为二元分类损失，解决了传统LLM对齐方法在人类偏好异质性下的不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM对齐方法对人类偏好的异质性很脆弱，拟合简单的概率模型会导致对人口平均效用的不一致估计。

Method: 使用sign estimator，在聚合步骤中用二元分类损失替换交叉熵损失，在温和假设下实现一致的序数对齐。

Result: 在LLM对齐的数字孪生模拟中，sign estimator显著减少了偏好扭曲，将估计误差降低近35%，与真实人口偏好的不一致性从12%降至8%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持现有LLM对齐管道实现简单性的同时，优于显式建模用户异质性的面板数据启发式方法。

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合个体社会基础设施韧性(SIR)的条件深度学习模型，用于预测破坏性事件后个体移动模式的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测破坏性事件前的个体移动模式变化面临挑战：缺乏个体异质性SIR的测量方法；个体移动模式与空间环境的复杂交互未被充分捕捉；个体级移动数据稀疏且不适合传统预测方法。

Method: 将个体SIR纳入条件深度学习模型，利用大规模稀疏个体级数据捕捉个体移动模式与局部空间环境的复杂关系。

Result: 实验表明，结合个体SIR和空间环境能增强模型预测事件后个体移动模式的能力。条件模型能捕捉到具有相似事前移动模式但SIR不同的个体在移动模式上的差异变化。

Conclusion: 整合个体社会基础设施韧性和空间环境能有效预测破坏性事件后的个体移动模式变化，为资源需求预测提供新方法。

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗AI服务于平均患者，在罕见变异、多病共存和代表性不足人群方面表现不佳，这种平均患者谬论损害公平性和信任。

Method: 构建多智能体生态系统，按器官系统、患者群体和分析模式聚类智能体，共享模型库和证据合成工具，通过协调层整合结果。

Result: 验证从群体平均转向个体可靠性，测量低密度区域误差、小样本校准和风险-覆盖权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法通过从单一模型转向协调智能，使医疗AI与医学首要原则保持一致：透明、公平、以个体为中心的护理。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneCast是一个结构化、模块化的跨域时间序列预测框架，通过将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量，分别使用轻量级投影模块和基于离散扩散的语义感知标记化方法进行建模，在多个领域实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域时间序列预测方法在处理异构数据时面临挑战，特别是在面对领域特定的趋势变化和不一致的周期性模式时表现不佳，主要问题在于将时间序列视为未分化的序列，没有显式解耦其固有结构组件。

Method: 提出OneCast框架：1）将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量；2）季节性分量通过轻量级投影模块使用可解释基函数重建周期性模式；3）趋势分量通过语义感知标记器在分段级别编码为离散标记，然后通过掩码离散扩散机制进行推断；4）两个分支的输出结合生成最终预测。

Result: 在八个领域上的广泛实验表明，OneCast在大多数情况下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过显式解耦时间序列的结构组件并采用模块化建模方法，OneCast能够有效捕捉季节性模式并跟踪领域特定趋势，在跨域时间序列预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 系统日志是网络安全的核心，但分析大量多样化日志数据面临高成本、缺乏专业知识和时间限制等挑战，许多组织难以进行基本分析。

Method: 采用模块化架构，包含路由器、日志识别器、日志解析器和搜索工具，结合LLM和ML算法，解决LLM的上下文窗口限制和结构化文本处理能力差的问题。

Result: 在四个不同领域日志和多种任务上评估，相比ChatGPT、ChatPDF和NotebookLM等最先进LLM聊天机器人，性能提升39%-68%，使用ROUGE-1分数时四分位距降低93%，结果变异性显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强LLM在结构化文本分析方面的能力，提高了准确性和鲁棒性，为网络安全专家和非技术用户提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车的普及，需要理解其驾驶行为以提高交通安全和开发智能驾驶系统，特别是在与传统燃油车混合行驶的环境中。

Method: 使用真实世界数据集，比较了IDM、OVM、OVRV和简化CACC等经典物理模型与随机森林回归器的预测性能，通过最小化RMSE来校准模型参数。

Result: 随机森林模型在所有场景下表现最优，RMSE分别为0.0046（中等距离）、0.0016（长距离）和0.0025（超长距离）；在物理模型中，CACC表现最好，长距离RMSE为2.67。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在预测电动汽车跟驰行为方面优于经典物理模型，对模拟电动汽车行为和分析混合自动驾驶交通动态具有重要价值。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

Motivation: 为了让医生真正信任人工智能，需要消除AI的黑箱特性，使其推理过程像咨询同事一样透明可理解。

Method: 开发了HistoLens系统，可将病理学家的自然语言问题转换为AI引擎的精确查询，提供结构化报告和热图可视化证据，并训练AI专注于患者组织而忽略背景噪声。

Result: 创建了一个工作流程，病理学家保持专家主导地位，使用可信赖的AI助手验证见解，实现更快、更自信的诊断。

Conclusion: HistoLens通过透明性和协作性设计，成功建立了医生与AI之间的信任关系，使AI成为病理学家的可靠助手而非黑箱工具。

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化框架，用于从半结构化知识源生成高难度、可用于训练的多跳问答问题，解决了现有数据集稀缺且不适合监督微调或强化学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多跳问答数据集稀缺，且大多仅适用于评估而非训练。人工构建需要多跳推理的问题成本高昂且难以扩展，这成为训练高能力检索推理代理的关键数据瓶颈。

Method: 系统包含三个步骤：(1)通过自然语言推理的关系类型化和多样性感知扩展生成多样化的逻辑标记证据簇；(2)应用反向问题构建来组合间接线索；(3)采用两步评估管道确保质量，包括多模型共识过滤和结构化约束分解与基于证据的匹配。

Result: 该框架能够规模化地生成复杂、检索抵抗但可验证的问题，既适用于监督微调/强化学习训练，也适用于具有挑战性的评估，大幅减少了人工策划工作。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架有效解决了多跳问答训练数据的稀缺问题，能够生成与强评估基准难度相当的高质量训练数据，同时显著降低人工成本。

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

TL;DR: BLM₁是一个多模态空间基础模型，通过两阶段训练实现了跨空间转移、跨任务学习和跨具身泛化，在数字和物理任务中均优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在数字-物理空间和具身智能体之间泛化能力差，VLAs缺乏高级推理能力，ELLMs局限于数字空间，需要统一的跨空间跨具身模型。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段通过精选数字语料注入具身知识，保持语言能力；第二阶段训练策略模块，通过意图桥接接口从MLLM提取高级语义指导控制。

Result: 单一BLM₁实例在数字任务中提升约6%，物理任务中提升约3%，优于MLLMs、ELLMs、VLAs和GMLMs四个模型家族。

Conclusion: BLM₁成功实现了跨空间、跨任务、跨具身的统一模型，为具身智能提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法局限于单数据集训练，限制了规划鲁棒性。研究发现不同数据集中车辆轨迹分布和历史-未来相关性具有显著一致性，为多数据集集成提供了基础。

Method: 1. HFTDN：聚合多数据集的历史-未来轨迹对，基于历史轨迹相似性检索相关未来轨迹生成跨数据集规划指导；2. GFTM：从多数据集中学习鲁棒的历史-未来相关性，将历史轨迹转换为通用规划先验；3. S2D：训练时选择性抑制规划先验实现鲁棒学习，推理时充分利用先验最大化规划性能。

Result: UniPlanner实现了跨数据集统一学习，提升了规划鲁棒性和性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了单数据集训练的局限性，通过多数据集集成显著提升了自动驾驶规划的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

TL;DR: MGA是一个基于"先观察后决策"原则的GUI智能体，通过独立建模每一步的环境状态，解决了传统方法对历史轨迹的依赖和局部探索偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI智能体存在两个主要问题：对历史轨迹的依赖导致错误传播，以及"决策优先、观察滞后"机制忽略关键界面线索。

Method: MGA将GUI交互重新构建为"先观察后决策"，每个步骤建模为独立的环境状态，包含当前截图、任务无关的空间信息和动态更新的结构化记忆。

Result: 在OSworld基准测试、真实桌面应用和跨任务迁移实验中，MGA在鲁棒性、泛化性和效率方面相比最先进基线方法取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: MGA通过观察优先的方法有效解决了GUI交互中的关键挑战，为GUI智能体发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: MCTS的样本效率问题可以通过状态/动作抽象来解决，但现有方法如pruned OGA在抽象节点内多个动作具有相同UCB值时使用随机平局规则，这存在改进空间。

Method: 提出并实证评估了多种替代随机策略的内部抽象策略，用于处理抽象节点内多个动作具有相同UCB值的情况。

Result: 提出的多种内部抽象策略在大多数环境和参数设置中表现优于随机策略。

Conclusion: 通过设计更好的内部抽象策略，可以显著提升基于抽象的MCTS算法的性能。

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM内部行为的自我指示方法，通过计算输入问题与输出推理路径之间的相关性矩阵秩来评估推理可信度，无需外部资源即可提升推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检查方法依赖外部资源（如训练验证器或复杂提示），导致高计算开销且仅适用于特定领域，需要一种更高效通用的LLM输出验证方法。

Method: 利用LLM内部行为，通过计算输入问题与输出推理路径之间的相关性矩阵秩作为推理正确性指标，设计简单的即插即用Self-Indicator方法对候选推理路径进行重加权。

Result: 在多个不同规模和模型家族的LLM上实验显示，该方法能区分正确与错误推理路径的准确率超过75%，并在三个推理基准上提升准确率超过8%。

Conclusion: LLM的内部行为已隐含其推理路径的可信度信息，Self-Indicator方法提供了一种高效、无需外部资源的推理验证方案。

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

Conclusion: 多智能体框架通过整合不同证据源有效提升了判断预测的准确性和可解释性，为声明验证任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

Conclusion: 通过系统应对七个关键挑战，gLLM辅助的定量内容分析可以更广泛地被传播研究者采用，并确保符合有效性、可靠性、可重复性和研究伦理的学科质量标准。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的数据科学系统仅依赖LLM内部推理，缺乏科学和理论原则指导，在处理噪声和复杂数据集时可信度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 基于PCS原则构建多智能体系统，采用模块化工作流处理数据清洗、特征工程、建模和评估，每个阶段由专门智能体负责，结合扰动分析、单元测试和模型验证。

Result: 在9个不同特征的数据集上评估，使用DeepSeek-V3和GPT-4o作为后端，VDSAgents持续优于AutoKaggle和DataInterpreter等最先进的端到端数据科学系统。

Conclusion: 将PCS原则嵌入LLM驱动的数据科学自动化是可行的，能显著提升系统性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

Motivation: 现有脑-AI对齐研究局限于特定输入和任务，缺乏比较不同模态AI模型内在组织方式的统一框架。

Method: 通过分析151个基于Transformer的模型（包括视觉、语言和多模态模型），将其内在空间注意力拓扑映射到标准人脑功能网络上。

Result: 发现模型在该空间中呈现连续弧状几何分布，脑相似度逐渐增加；模型分布模式受预训练范式和位置编码方案影响，而非仅由模态决定。

Conclusion: Brain-like Space为跨领域智能提供了首个统一框架，揭示了连接机器与大脑的深层组织原则，且脑相似度与下游任务性能并非完全一致。

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

TL;DR: Orion是一个高效推理框架，通过依赖感知的查询分解和逻辑并行内容扩展，解决了LLM在实时Web应用中的效率与质量平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理存在计算效率低和推理策略僵化的问题，无法同时满足Web服务对低延迟、高吞吐和高推理质量的双重要求。

Method: 将查询推理分为两个协同阶段：关键点生成（通过检索增强的少样本提示生成逻辑结构化的关键点）和内容并行扩展（基于依赖图并发扩展内容确保逻辑一致性），并引入流水线调度机制实现跨查询并行。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Orion相比基线实现了最高4.33倍的token生成速度和3.42倍的答案延迟降低，同时通过显式建模点间依赖关系将推理质量提升了18.75%。

Conclusion: Orion框架成功解决了LLM推理在Web应用中的效率与质量平衡问题，通过创新的分解和并行策略显著提升了推理性能。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进SNN在强化学习中训练效果的方法，通过分析替代梯度斜率设置和引入特权引导策略，显著提升了无人机位置控制任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN在复杂控制任务中面临的两个关键挑战：非可微分脉冲神经元需要替代梯度但优化特性不明确，以及SNN的状态动态需要在序列上训练但在强化学习中早期训练序列长度有限。

Method: 系统分析替代梯度斜率设置，发现较浅斜率能增加深层梯度幅度但减少与真实梯度的对齐；提出利用特权引导策略引导学习过程，同时保持脉冲策略与环境的在线交互。

Result: 在强化学习设置中，较浅斜率或调度斜率使训练和最终部署性能提升2.1倍；结合自适应斜率调度在真实世界无人机位置控制任务中达到400分平均回报，显著优于行为克隆和TD3BC等现有技术。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对SNN中替代梯度学习的理论理解，并展示了在真实世界机器人系统中实用的神经形态控制器训练方法。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的两阶段流程，通过跨任务示例和基于图的标签传播方法减少对LLM数据标注的依赖，从而降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为新颖或困难任务收集高质量示例成本高昂且劳动密集，需要减少对LLM数据标注的依赖。

Method: 两阶段流程：第一阶段利用跨任务示例提示LLM对少量目标任务实例进行伪标注；第二阶段引入基于图的标签传播方法，在不额外查询LLM的情况下将标签信息传播到剩余目标示例。

Result: 在五个任务上的实验表明，该方法在降低标注成本的同时实现了强大的性能。

Conclusion: 该流程结合了跨任务监督的灵活性和无需LLM传播的可扩展性，为ICL提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

Motivation: 现有数据合成方法（如随机环境采样或多智能体角色扮演）在真实世界环境中无法生成高质量的多轮工具调用训练数据，存在目标模型训练、工具架构隔离和多轮逻辑依赖三大挑战。

Method: FunReason-MT采用三种核心技术：1) 环境-API图交互收集多样化高质量轨迹；2) 高级工具查询合成简化复杂查询构建；3) 引导迭代链生成复杂思维链。

Result: 在Berkeley函数调用排行榜（BFCLv3）上，基于FunReason-MT生成数据训练的4B模型在同等规模模型中达到最先进性能，超越大多数闭源模型。在BFCLv4上的进一步性能提升证实了该框架的可靠性。

Conclusion: FunReason-MT为智能体学习提供了可靠且鲁棒的数据源，能够有效解决多轮函数调用数据合成的复杂性障碍。

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

presents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is
effective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance
of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.

Conclusion: 通过将工具依赖关系与领域知识相结合，可以显著提升工具增强推理和规划的效果，为复杂任务中的示例生成提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools
and documents to enhance exemplar artifact generation. Our method begins by
constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.

Motivation: 当前机器人操作方法主要依赖显式指令，而真实世界中人类很少直接发出指令，需要机器人能够主动推断用户意图以实现有效协作。

Method: 提出RoboOmni框架，采用Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor架构，基于端到端全模态LLM，统一意图识别、交互确认和动作执行，时空融合听觉和视觉信号。

Conclusion: RoboOmni框架能够有效处理跨模态上下文指令，实现主动意图识别和协作，为真实世界人机交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid
progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation.
Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on
explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue
instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user
intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual
instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue,
environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address
this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor
framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention
recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses
auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition,
while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training
data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build
OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640
backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation
and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based
baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and
proactive assistance.

Motivation: 虽然社交机器人在支持学习任务方面已被广泛研究，但它们在协助学生自主学习方面的潜力尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在探索社交机器人如何通过提供任务导向的目标提醒和积极情感支持来充当大学生自主学习同伴。

Method: 采用探索性的Wizard-of-Oz研究设计，比较三种条件：目标提醒、情感支持和仅提供物理存在的控制组，评估这些支持行为对学生感知专注度、生产力和参与度的影响。

Abstract: While the efficacy of social robots in supporting people in learning tasks
has been extensively investigated, their potential impact in assisting students
in self-studying contexts has not been investigated much. This study explores
how a social robot can act as a peer study companion for college students
during self-study tasks by delivering task-oriented goal reminder and positive
emotional support. We conducted an exploratory Wizard-of-Oz study to explore
how these robotic support behaviors impacted students' perceived focus,
productivity, and engagement in comparison to a robot that only provided
physical presence (control). Our study results suggest that participants in the
goal reminder and the emotional support conditions reported greater ease of
use, with the goal reminder condition additionally showing a higher willingness
to use the robot in future study sessions. Participants' satisfaction with the
robot was correlated with their perception of the robot as a social other, and
this perception was found to be a predictor for their level of goal achievement
in the self-study task. These findings highlight the potential of socially
assistive robots to support self-study through both functional and emotional
engagement.

Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the obstacle
negotiation of legs, yet many state-of-the-art systems rely on costly actuators
and sensors, and fall-recovery is seldom integrated, especially for
wheeled-legged morphologies. This work presents a recovery-aware
visual-inertial navigation system on a low-cost wheeled quadruped. The proposed
system leverages vision-based perception from a depth camera and deep
reinforcement learning policies for robust locomotion and autonomous recovery
from falls across diverse terrains. Simulation experiments show agile mobility
with low-torque actuators over irregular terrain and reliably recover from
external perturbations and self-induced failures. We further show goal directed
navigation in structured indoor spaces with low-cost perception. Overall, this
approach lowers the barrier to deploying autonomous navigation and robust
locomotion policies in budget-constrained robotic platforms.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive keyframe selection method for improved
3D scene reconstruction in dynamic environments. The proposed method integrates
two complementary modules: an error-based selection module utilizing
photometric and structural similarity (SSIM) errors, and a momentum-based
update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds according
to scene motion dynamics. By dynamically curating the most informative frames,
our approach addresses a key data bottleneck in real-time perception. This
allows for the creation of high-quality 3D world representations from a
compressed data stream, a critical step towards scalable robot learning and
deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies,
such as fixed temporal intervals or uniform frame skipping. These findings
highlight a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can
dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes. We evaluate our
proposed adaptive keyframe selection module on two recent state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, and observe consistent improvements
in reconstruction quality across both frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive
ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each individual component in our
method, underlining their contribution to the overall performance gains.

Abstract: Tendon-actuated concentric tube mechanisms combine the advantages of
tendon-driven continuum robots and concentric tube robots while addressing
their respective limitations. They overcome the restricted degrees of freedom
often seen in tendon-driven designs, and mitigate issues such as snapping
instability associated with concentric tube robots. However, a complete and
general mechanical model for these systems remains an open problem. In this
work, we propose a Cosserat rod-based framework for modeling the general case
of $n$ concentric tubes, each actuated by $m_i$ tendons, where $i = \{1,
\ldots, n\}$. The model allows each tube to twist and elongate while enforcing
a shared centerline for bending. We validate the proposed framework through
experiments with two-tube and three tube assemblies under various tendon
routing configurations, achieving tip prediction errors $<4\%$ of the robot's
total length. We further demonstrate the model's generality by applying it to
existing robots in the field, where maximum tip deviations remain around $5\%$
of the total length. This model provides a foundation for accurate shape

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种能够自适应扭转变形的软体机器人手指，通过包裹方式抓取物体。该手指能够在平面内和平面外方向进行自适应扭转变形，从而深入物体间的狭窄间隙进行抓取。


<details>

Conclusion: 提出的可变刚度软体手指能够成功实现自适应扭转变形和包裹式抓取功能，为在密集物体环境中进行精确抓取提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a soft robot finger capable of adaptive-twist deformation
to grasp objects by wrapping them. For a soft hand to grasp and pick-up one
object from densely contained multiple objects, a soft finger requires the
adaptive-twist deformation function in both in-plane and out-of-plane
directions. The function allows the finger to be inserted deeply into a limited
gap among objects. Once inserted, the soft finger requires appropriate control
of grasping force normal to contact surface, thereby maintaining the twisted
deformation. In this paper, we refer to this type of grasping as grasping by
wrapping. To achieve these two functions by a single actuation source, we
propose a variable stiffness mechanism that can adaptively change the stiffness
as the pressure is higher. We conduct a finite element analysis (FEA) on the
proposed mechanism and determine its design parameter based on the FEA result.
Using the developed soft finger, we report basic experimental results and
demonstrations on grasping various objects.

Abstract: This survey comprehensively reviews the evolving field of multi-robot
collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). As an explicit scene representation, 3DGS has enabled
unprecedented real-time, high-fidelity rendering, ideal for robotics. However,
its use in multi-robot systems introduces significant challenges in maintaining
global consistency, managing communication, and fusing data from heterogeneous
sources. We systematically categorize approaches by their architecture --
centralized, distributed -- and analyze core components like multi-agent
consistency and alignment, communication-efficient, Gaussian representation,
semantic distillation, fusion and pose optimization, and real-time scalability.
In addition, a summary of critical datasets and evaluation metrics is provided
to contextualize performance. Finally, we identify key open challenges and
chart future research directions, including lifelong mapping, semantic
association and mapping, multi-model for robustness, and bridging the Sim2Real

Motivation: 现有端到端深度强化学习方法在泛化到新地形时存在安全性和可解释性限制，需要更安全可靠的机器人运动控制方法。

Conclusion: VOCALoco框架通过模块化技能选择有效提升了腿式机器人在复杂地形上的运动安全性和能效。

Abstract: Recent advancements in legged robot locomotion have facilitated traversal
over increasingly complex terrains. Despite this progress, many existing
approaches rely on end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which poses
limitations in terms of safety and interpretability, especially when
generalizing to novel terrains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VOCALoco, a modular skill-selection framework that dynamically adapts
locomotion strategies based on perceptual input. Given a set of pre-trained
locomotion policies, VOCALoco evaluates their viability and energy-consumption
by predicting both the safety of execution and the anticipated cost of
transport over a fixed planning horizon. This joint assessment enables the
selection of policies that are both safe and energy-efficient, given the
observed local terrain. We evaluate our approach on staircase locomotion tasks,
demonstrating its performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios using
a quadrupedal robot. Empirical results show that VOCALoco achieves improved
robustness and safety during stair ascent and descent compared to a
conventional end-to-end DRL policy

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了具有垂直角度敏感性的三维边界向量细胞模型，解决了传统二维BVC模型在水平对称环境中的空间模糊问题，显著提高了三维空间中的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BVC模型仅限于二维环境，在存在水平对称性的环境中容易产生空间模糊，需要扩展到三维空间以解决这一问题。

Method: 在BVC框架中引入垂直角度敏感性，处理LiDAR数据捕捉垂直轮廓，从而区分在纯二维表示中无法区分的位置。

Result: 在垂直变化最小的环境中，3D模型与2D基线性能相当；随着3D复杂性增加，产生更明显的空间场并显著减少空间混叠。

Conclusion: 在BVC定位中添加垂直维度可以显著增强真实世界3D空间中的导航和地图构建，同时在简单近平面场景中保持性能相当。

Abstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of
vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and
allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the
hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional
(2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of
horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we
incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby
enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to
significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired
robot model.
  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby
disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D
representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal
vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D
baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more
distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings
show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can
significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while
retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.

TL;DR: SynAD是首个利用合成数据增强真实世界端到端自动驾驶模型的框架，通过在多智能体合成场景中指定具有最全面驾驶信息的智能体作为ego车辆，将路径级场景投影到地图上，并使用Map-to-BEV网络生成鸟瞰图特征，有效提升了安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界驾驶数据限制了训练场景的多样性，而合成场景生成虽然能丰富数据多样性，但在端到端自动驾驶模型中的应用尚未充分探索，主要因为缺乏指定的ego车辆和传感器输入。

Method: 在多智能体合成场景中指定信息最全面的智能体作为ego车辆；将路径级场景投影到地图上；开发Map-to-BEV网络生成鸟瞰图特征；设计训练策略有效整合地图基础合成数据与真实驾驶数据。

Result: 实验结果表明SynAD有效整合了所有组件，显著提升了安全性能。

Conclusion: SynAD通过桥接合成场景生成和端到端自动驾驶，为更全面和鲁棒的自动驾驶模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of high-quality
real-world driving datasets have propelled end-to-end autonomous driving.
Despite this progress, relying solely on real-world data limits the variety of
driving scenarios for training. Synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a
promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data; however, its
application within E2E AD models remains largely unexplored. This is primarily
due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor
inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To
address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance
real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent
with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a
multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto
maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view
features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training
strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real
driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively
integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance. By bridging
synthetic scenario generation and E2E AD, SynAD paves the way for more
comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models.

Abstract: Perceptual ambiguity and task conflict limit multitask robotic manipulation
via imitation learning. We propose a framework combining a Language-Conditioned
Visual Representation (LCVR) module and a Language-conditioned
Mixture-ofExperts Density Policy (LMoE-DP). LCVR resolves perceptual
ambiguities by grounding visual features with language instructions, enabling
differentiation between visually similar tasks. To mitigate task conflict,
LMoE-DP uses a sparse expert architecture to specialize in distinct, multimodal
action distributions, stabilized by gradient modulation. On real-robot
benchmarks, LCVR boosts Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) and Diffusion
Policy (DP) success rates by 33.75% and 25%, respectively. The full framework

Abstract: This work addresses the collaborative multi-robot autonomous online

for dynamically balanced exploration area partition and task allocation among a
team of mobile robots operating in obstacle-dense non-convex environments.
  We present a novel topological map structure that simultaneously
characterizes both spatial connectivity and global exploration completeness of

are planned in a receding horizon fashion under global coverage guidance.
  A distributed weighted topological graph Voronoi algorithm is introduced
implementing balanced graph space partitions of the fused topological maps.
Theoretical guarantees are provided for distributed consensus convergence and
equitable graph space partitions with constant bounds.
  A local planner optimizes the visitation sequence of exploration targets
within the balanced partitioned graph space to minimize travel distance, while
generating safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible motion trajectories.
  Comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates
significant improvements in exploration efficiency, completeness, and workload
balance across the robot team.

Abstract: To generate reliable motion for legged robots through trajectory
optimization, it is crucial to simultaneously compute the robot's path and
contact sequence, as well as accurately consider the dynamics in the problem
formulation. In this paper, we present a phase-based trajectory optimization
that ensures the feasibility of translational dynamics and friction cone
constraints throughout the entire trajectory. Specifically, our approach
leverages the superposition properties of linear differential equations to
decouple the translational dynamics for each contact point, which operates
under different phase sequences. Furthermore, we utilize the differentiation
matrix of B{\'e}zier polynomials to derive an analytical relationship between
the robot's position and force, thereby ensuring the consistent satisfaction of
translational dynamics. Additionally, by exploiting the convex closure property
of B{\'e}zier polynomials, our method ensures compliance with friction cone
constraints. Using the aforementioned approach, the proposed trajectory
optimization framework can generate dynamically reliable motions with various
gait sequences for legged robots. We validate our framework using a quadruped
robot model, focusing on the feasibility of dynamics and motion generation.

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶框架主要依赖模仿学习，但受限于次优专家演示和部署时的协变量偏移问题。强化学习虽然能利用模拟环境扩展，但通常局限于低维符号输入，无法实现真正的端到端学习。

Method: 提出ZTRS框架，结合离线强化学习和穷举策略优化方法，直接处理高维传感器数据，完全消除模仿学习依赖，仅通过奖励信号进行训练。

Conclusion: ZTRS证明了仅通过奖励学习直接处理传感器数据的可行性，为端到端自动驾驶提供了新的研究方向，避免了模仿学习的局限性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving maps raw sensor inputs directly into
ego-vehicle trajectories to avoid cascading errors from perception modules and
to leverage rich semantic cues. Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation
Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and
covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is
typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and
maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We
introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory
Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs
without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of
our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only
learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.
ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive
Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable
actions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three
benchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop
planning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM
(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the
state-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on
HUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a
significant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era
of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human
welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of
robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex
task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up
new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents
often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control
tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic
manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical
world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises
a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an
action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a
vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task
performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent
achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real
environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly
improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction
tasks.

Abstract: Navigating to a designated goal using visual information is a fundamental
capability for intelligent robots. Most classical visual navigation methods are
restricted to single-goal, single-modality, and closed set goal settings. To
address the practical demands of multi-modal, open-vocabulary goal queries and
multi-goal visual navigation, we propose LagMemo, a navigation system that
leverages a language 3D Gaussian Splatting memory. During exploration, LagMemo
constructs a unified 3D language memory. With incoming task goals, the system
queries the memory, predicts candidate goal locations, and integrates a local
perception-based verification mechanism to dynamically match and validate goals
during navigation. For fair and rigorous evaluation, we curate GOAT-Core, a
high-quality core split distilled from GOAT-Bench tailored to multi-modal
open-vocabulary multi-goal visual navigation. Experimental results show that
LagMemo's memory module enables effective multi-modal open-vocabulary goal

Abstract: Behavioral cloning is a simple yet effective technique for learning
sequential decision-making from demonstrations. Recently, it has gained
prominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where
achieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of
tasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates
a (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the
task's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is
compelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that
cloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its
fully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg
insertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from
the Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical
analysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with
$\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to
the demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and
practice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with
fewer demonstrated tasks. Project page with videos and code:

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robots and
autonomous systems that can interact with human in a more natural and intuitive
way. One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these
systems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of
humans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style
manipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP.
The approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of
tool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The
discriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation
data executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates
realistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human
motion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and
the results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation
skills that outperform current baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate
that HMAMP has potential for real-world applications by performing real robot
arm hammering tasks. In general, HMAMP represents a significant step towards
developing robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a
more natural and intuitive way, by learning to manipulate tools and objects in
a manner similar to how humans do.

Abstract: Learning generalizable robotic manipulation policies remains a key challenge
due to the scarcity of diverse real-world training data. While recent
approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised
representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms
such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or
scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize
2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and
dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present
DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and
dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future
prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on
multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future
dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned
representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic
manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two
challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic
experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate,
generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability
across diverse manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 传统起重机轨迹规划方法难以直接处理非线性摩擦和碰撞避免等复杂物理约束，导致实际应用中可能出现执行器饱和和碰撞问题。

Method: 利用微分平坦性框架，直接包含非线性摩擦、载荷和绳索碰撞避免等复杂物理和动态约束，仅约束末端点的载荷摆动。

Result: 对比仿真验证表明，忽略干摩擦会导致执行器饱和和碰撞，而摩擦建模是实现快速安全起重机轨迹的基本要求。

Conclusion: 摩擦建模对于生成快速安全的起重机轨迹至关重要，所提出的微分平坦性方法能有效处理复杂约束并实现激进运动。

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal trajectory generation method for 3D overhead
cranes by leveraging differential flatness. This framework enables the direct
inclusion of complex physical and dynamic constraints, such as nonlinear
friction and collision avoidance for both payload and rope. Our approach allows
for aggressive movements by constraining payload swing only at the final point.
A comparative simulation study validates our approach, demonstrating that
neglecting dry friction leads to actuator saturation and collisions. The
results show that friction modeling is a fundamental requirement for fast and
safe crane trajectories.

TL;DR: 提出CoNi-OA算法，专门用于无人机-地面车辆协同场景中的避障，无需全局状态估计或障碍物预测，仅使用单帧LiDAR数据实时生成避障轨迹


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoNi-MPC框架在无人机控制中有效但缺乏环境信息，导致避障困难。需要一种不依赖全局状态估计的避障方法来解决无人机-地面车辆协同任务中的障碍物规避问题

Method: 利用单帧原始LiDAR数据生成调制矩阵，直接调整四旋翼无人机速度实现避障。基于调制的方法在UGV非惯性坐标系中实时生成无碰撞轨迹

Result: 算法计算需求显著降低（每次迭代小于5毫秒），在动态和不可预测环境中保持安全性，适用于静态和动态环境

Conclusion: CoNi-OA为无人机-地面车辆协同系统提供了一种高效、实时的避障解决方案，无需全局状态估计或障碍物预测，扩展了在特征缺失或未知场景中的适用性

Abstract: CoNi-MPC provides an efficient framework for UAV control in air-ground
cooperative tasks by relying exclusively on relative states, eliminating the
need for global state estimation. However, its lack of environmental
information poses significant challenges for obstacle avoidance. To address
this issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative
Non-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for
UAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or
obstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data
from the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the
quadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based
method enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the
UGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less
than 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable
environments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a
modulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV
cooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time
trajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the
need for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static
and dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or
unknown scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法能准确预测步态进展和关节角度，对动力大腿假肢的障碍跨越具有重要实用价值。

Abstract: For amputees with powered transfemoral prosthetics, navigating obstacles or
complex terrain remains challenging. This study addresses this issue by using
an inertial sensor on the sound ankle to guide obstacle-crossing movements. A
genetic algorithm computes the optimal neural network structure to predict the
required angles of the thigh and knee joints. A gait progression prediction
algorithm determines the actuation angle index for the prosthetic knee motor,
ultimately defining the necessary thigh and knee angles and gait progression.
Results show that when the standard deviation of Gaussian noise added to the
thigh angle data is less than 1, the method can effectively eliminate noise
interference, achieving 100\% accuracy in gait phase estimation under 150 Hz,
with thigh angle prediction error being 8.71\% and knee angle prediction error
being 6.78\%. These findings demonstrate the method's ability to accurately
predict gait progression and joint angles, offering significant practical value

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器噪声协方差在实际中难以准确指定，受环境变化、前端预处理等因素影响，需要可靠的状态估计方法。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：下层使用不变扩展卡尔曼滤波进行轨迹估计，上层通过导数滤波器计算分析梯度来优化协方差。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法比现有基线方法具有更高的效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过贝叶斯因子分解和并行计算，有效解决了噪声协方差估计问题，实现了高效的状态估计。

Abstract: Reliable state estimation hinges on accurate specification of sensor noise
covariances, which weigh heterogeneous measurements. In practice, these
covariances are difficult to identify due to environmental variability,
front-end preprocessing, and other reasons. We address this by formulating
noise covariance estimation as a bilevel optimization that, from a Bayesian
perspective, factorizes the joint likelihood of so-called odometry and
supervisory measurements, thereby balancing information utilization with
computational efficiency. The factorization converts the nested Bayesian
dependency into a chain structure, enabling efficient parallel computation: at
the lower level, an invariant extended Kalman filter with state augmentation
estimates trajectories, while a derivative filter computes analytical gradients
in parallel for upper-level gradient updates. The upper level refines the
covariance to guide the lower-level estimation. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets show that our method achieves higher efficiency over
existing baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了随机奖励收集游戏(SPCG)作为团队定向问题(TOP)的扩展，用于在自利机器人、能量约束和随机转移条件下进行规划。通过理论分析和算法设计，证明了在特定条件下存在纯纳什均衡，并提出了两种算法来学习有效的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的团队定向问题(TOP)变体假设所有机器人合作实现单一目标，无法扩展到奖励稀缺环境中机器人竞争的场景。需要一种能够处理自利机器人在图上操作、受能量约束和随机转移影响的规划方法。

Method: 提出了随机奖励收集游戏(SPCG)框架，设计了两种算法：Ordinal Rank Search(ORS)用于获取序数排名，Fictitious Ordinal Response Learning(FORL)用于学习针对高排名对手的最佳响应策略。

Result: 在道路网络和合成图上的实证评估表明：1) ORS的条件化状态别名使策略学习在大型团队中更高效；2) FORL训练的策略在不平衡奖励分布下泛化能力更好；3) 学习策略达到了等效TOP混合整数线性规划解的87%-95%最优性。

Conclusion: SPCG框架成功扩展了TOP以处理竞争性多机器人场景，提出的算法能够有效学习可扩展且泛化能力强的策略，在复杂环境下接近最优解。

Abstract: The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) generalizes many real-world multi-robot
scheduling and routing tasks that occur in autonomous mobility, aerial
logistics, and surveillance applications. While many flavors of the TOP exist
for planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate
toward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the
robots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic
Prize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the
presence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy
constraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and
star graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs
that coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a
rank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal
Rank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in
temporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious
Ordinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's
senior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and
synthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show
that 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies
that scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the
global index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced
prize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods.
Finally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95%
optimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer
linear programming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器人视觉惯性SLAM面临视觉退化和IMU运动激励不足的挑战，需要开发更稳定和准确的定位与建图系统。

Method: 利用立体相机直接深度估计，消除IMU初始化中的尺度估计需求；通过精确重力初始化，将俯仰和横滚从位姿估计中解耦，求解4自由度PnP问题；使用最小3点求解器减少计算时间；提出偏差消除的4-DOF PnP估计器；动态运动时联合估计IMU协方差以自适应调整重力先验权重。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上的广泛实验表明，GeVI-SLAM相比最先进方法具有更高的精度和更好的稳定性。

Conclusion: GeVI-SLAM通过重力增强和4-DOF PnP方法，有效解决了水下机器人SLAM的挑战，实现了更准确和稳定的性能。

Abstract: Accurate visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI SLAM) for
underwater robots remains a significant challenge due to frequent visual
degeneracy and insufficient inertial measurement unit (IMU) motion excitation.
In this paper, we present GeVI-SLAM, a gravity-enhanced stereo VI SLAM system
designed to address these issues. By leveraging the stereo camera's direct
depth estimation ability, we eliminate the need to estimate scale during IMU
initialization, enabling stable operation even under low acceleration dynamics.
With precise gravity initialization, we decouple the pitch and roll from the
pose estimation and solve a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) problem for pose tracking. This allows the use of a minimal 3-point
solver, which significantly reduces computational time to reject outliers
within a Random Sample Consensus framework. We further propose a
bias-eliminated 4-DOF PnP estimator with provable consistency, ensuring the
relative pose converges to the true value as the feature number increases. To
handle dynamic motion, we refine the full 6-DOF pose while jointly estimating
the IMU covariance, enabling adaptive weighting of the gravity prior. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that GeVI-SLAM
achieves higher accuracy and greater stability compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层框架来支持环境不确定性下的机器人巡检，通过全局视图规划和局部视图重规划相结合，在保持全局覆盖目标的同时适应局部表面形态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于已知环境模型规划巡检路线，但模型与实际现场条件之间的差异（由自然或人为活动引起）可能改变表面形态或引入路径障碍，需要应对环境不确定性。

Method: 将巡检任务分为两个层次：(a)基于历史地图生成感兴趣区域的初始全局视图规划；(b)局部视图重规划以适应巡检场景的当前形态。

Result: 通过在地下矿井中使用四足机器人的实际部署验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的分层框架能够在保持全局覆盖目标的同时，使局部自主系统对环境不确定性保持鲁棒性，并完成巡检任务。

Abstract: In this work, we present a hierarchical framework designed to support robotic
inspection under environment uncertainty. By leveraging a known environment
model, existing methods plan and safely track inspection routes to visit points
of interest. However, discrepancies between the model and actual site
conditions, caused by either natural or human activities, can alter the surface
morphology or introduce path obstructions. To address this challenge, the
proposed framework divides the inspection task into: (a) generating the initial
global view-plan for region of interests based on a historical map and (b)
local view replanning to adapt to the current morphology of the inspection
scene. The proposed hierarchy preserves global coverage objectives while
enabling reactive adaptation to the local surface morphology. This enables the
local autonomy to remain robust against environment uncertainty and complete
the inspection tasks. We validate the approach through deployments in
real-world subterranean mines using quadrupedal robot.

TL;DR: 提出了统一迭代校准(UIC)框架，用于多传感器系统的外参和时间偏移联合校准，特别针对水下SLAM中的DVL传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DVL校准方法受限于特定传感器配置或依赖过度简化假设，且无法同时估计平移外参和时间偏移。

Method: 采用最大后验估计框架，结合高斯过程运动先验进行高保真运动插值，交替进行GP运动状态更新和梯度校准变量更新。

Result: UIC可应用于IMU、相机等多种传感器，开发了开源DVL-相机校准工具箱，仿真和真实世界测试验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: UIC框架不仅适用于水下应用，其GP先验集成和可靠初始化程序等设计可广泛应用于其他多传感器校准问题。

Abstract: The calibration of extrinsic parameters and clock offsets between sensors for
high-accuracy performance in underwater SLAM systems remains insufficiently
explored. Existing methods for Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) calibration are
either constrained to specific sensor configurations or rely on oversimplified
assumptions, and none jointly estimate translational extrinsics and time
offsets. We propose a Unified Iterative Calibration (UIC) framework for general
DVL sensor setups, formulated as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with a
Gaussian Process (GP) motion prior for high-fidelity motion interpolation. UIC
alternates between efficient GP-based motion state updates and gradient-based
calibration variable updates, supported by a provably statistically consistent
sequential initialization scheme. The proposed UIC can be applied to IMU,
cameras and other modalities as co-sensors. We release an open-source
DVL-camera calibration toolbox. Beyond underwater applications, several aspects
of UIC-such as the integration of GP priors for MAP-based calibration and the
design of provably reliable initialization procedures-are broadly applicable to
other multi-sensor calibration problems. Finally, simulations and real-world
tests validate our approach.

Abstract: This paper presents a curriculum-based reinforcement learning framework for
training precise and high-performance jumping policies for the robot `Olympus'.
Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a
simple yet effective strategy. First, we densify the inherently sparse jumping
reward using the laws of projectile motion. Next, a reference state
initialization scheme is employed to accelerate the exploration of dynamic
jumping behaviors without reliance on reference trajectories. We also present a
walking policy that, when combined with the jumping policies, unlocks versatile
and dynamic locomotion capabilities. Comprehensive testing validates walking on
varied terrain surfaces and jumping performance that exceeds previous works,
effectively crossing the Sim2Real gap. Experimental validation demonstrates
horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to
1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed
method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce GroundLoc, a LiDAR-only localization pipeline
designed to localize a mobile robot in large-scale outdoor environments using
prior maps. GroundLoc employs a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) image projection focusing
on the perceived ground area and utilizes the place recognition network R2D2,
or alternatively, the non-learning approach Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
(SIFT), to identify and select keypoints for BEV image map registration. Our
results demonstrate that GroundLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
SemanticKITTI and HeLiPR datasets across various sensors. In the multi-session
localization evaluation, GroundLoc reaches an Average Trajectory Error (ATE)
well below 50 cm on all Ouster OS2 128 sequences while meeting online runtime
requirements. The system supports various sensor models, as evidenced by
evaluations conducted with Velodyne HDL-64E, Ouster OS2 128, Aeva Aeries II,
and Livox Avia sensors. The prior maps are stored as 2D raster image maps,
which can be created from a single drive and require only 4 MB of storage per

Abstract: With the increasing integration of intelligent driving functions into
serial-produced vehicles, ensuring their functionality and robustness poses
greater challenges. Compared to traditional road testing, scenario-based
virtual testing offers significant advantages in terms of time and cost
efficiency, reproducibility, and exploration of edge cases. We propose a
Transformer-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE-T) model for
generating multi-agent traffic scenarios in roundabouts, which are
characterized by high vehicle dynamics and complex layouts, yet remain
relatively underexplored in current research. The results show that the
proposed model can accurately reconstruct original scenarios and generate
realistic, diverse synthetic scenarios. Besides, two Key-Performance-Indicators
(KPIs) are employed to evaluate the interactive behavior in the generated
scenarios. Analysis of the latent space reveals partial disentanglement, with
several latent dimensions exhibiting distinct and interpretable effects on
scenario attributes such as vehicle entry timing, exit timing, and velocity
profiles. The results demonstrate the model's capability to generate scenarios
for the validation of intelligent driving functions involving multi-agent
interactions, as well as to augment data for their development and iterative
improvement.

Conclusion: Fare框架成功构建了故障弹性的模仿学习策略，显著提升了视觉导航在分布外场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: While imitation learning (IL) enables effective visual navigation, IL
policies are prone to unpredictable failures in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios. We advance the notion of failure-resilient policies, which not only
detect failures but also recover from them automatically. Failure recognition
that identifies the factors causing failure is key to informing recovery: e.g.
pinpointing image regions triggering failure detections can provide cues to
guide recovery. We present Fare, a framework to construct failure-resilient IL
policies, embedding OOD-detection and recognition in them without using
explicit failure data, and pairing them with recovery heuristics. Real-world
experiments show that Fare enables failure recovery across two different policy
architectures, enabling robust long-range navigation in complex environments.

Abstract: Real-time control is an essential aspect of safe robot operation in the real
world with dynamic objects. We present a framework for the analysis of
object-aware controllers, methods for altering a robot's motion to anticipate
and avoid possible collisions. This framework is focused on three design
considerations: kinematics, motion profiles, and virtual constraints.
Additionally, the analysis in this work relies on verification of robot
behaviors using fundamental robot-obstacle experimental scenarios. To showcase
the effectiveness of our method we compare three representative object-aware
controllers. The comparison uses metrics originating from the design
considerations. From the analysis, we find that the design of object-aware
controllers often lacks kinematic considerations, continuity of control points,
and stability in movement profiles. We conclude that this framework can be used
in the future to design, compare, and benchmark obstacle avoidance methods.

constituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output
evolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework
for embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique
strategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing,
and physical algorithmic computing. These embodied computers enable the soft
robot to perform complex behaviors that would otherwise require CMOS-based
electronics -- including coordinated locomotion with obstacle avoidance,
payload weight and orientation classification, and programmable operation based
on logical rules. This paper will detail the working principles of these
embodied physical computing methods, survey the current state-of-the-art, and
present a perspective for future development.

TL;DR: Reality Distortion Room (RDR) 是一个基于投影映射的增强现实系统，通过视觉效果改变房间外观来微妙地鼓励用户移动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究用户在物理房间中如何对视觉失真效果产生运动反应，为在有限物理空间中实现AR体验提供基础理解。

Method: 使用Microsoft RoomAlive系统进行投影映射和无障碍交互，在标准客厅中展示五种增强效果：墙壁网格、家具全息图和空气中的小颗粒。

Result: 实验显示用户对不同的失真和增强效果有反应，增强后的客厅可以产生伸长、包裹、移位、抬高和放大的视觉印象。

Conclusion: 该研究支持在有限物理空间中实现AR体验，提供了关于如何微妙鼓励用户在房间内移动的初步理解。

Abstract: Reality Distortion Room (RDR) is a proof-of-concept augmented reality system
using projection mapping and unencumbered interaction with the Microsoft
RoomAlive system to study a user's locomotive response to visual effects that
seemingly transform the physical room the user is in. This study presents five
effects that augment the appearance of a physical room to subtly encourage user
motion. Our experiment demonstrates users' reactions to the different
distortion and augmentation effects in a standard living room, with the
distortion effects projected as wall grids, furniture holograms, and small
particles in the air. The augmented living room can give the impression of
becoming elongated, wrapped, shifted, elevated, and enlarged. The study results
support the implementation of AR experiences in limited physical spaces by
providing an initial understanding of how users can be subtly encouraged to
move throughout a room.

TL;DR: Spatial Orchestra是一个AR音乐体验系统，用户通过走进彩色虚拟气泡来演奏大提琴音符，无需音乐技能即可创作音乐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让任何技能水平的人都能轻松创作音乐，探索空间感知与音乐表演艺术之间的复杂关系。

Method: 使用独立AR头显，用户在指定区域内与不断移动的声音气泡互动，通过走进彩色编码的气泡来触发大提琴音符。

Result: 用户可以通过自然行走和舞蹈动作在充满气泡的环境中创作音乐，将参与者转变为音乐家。

Conclusion: 该系统成功展示了空间感知与音乐表演的融合，使音乐创作变得简单易行且富有表现力。

Abstract: Spatial Orchestra demonstrates how easy it is to play musical instruments
using basic input like natural locomotion, which is accessible to most. Unlike
many musical instruments, our work allows individuals of all skill levels to
effortlessly create music by walking into virtual bubbles. Our Augmented
Reality experience involves interacting with ever-shifting sound bubbles that
the user engages with by stepping into color-coded bubbles within the assigned
area using a standalone AR headset. Each bubble corresponds to a cello note,
and omits sound from the center of the bubble, and lets the user hear and
express in spatial audio, effectively transforming participants into musicians.
This interactive element enables users to explore the intersection of spatial
awareness, musical rhythm that extends to bodily expression through playful
movements and dance-like gestures within the bubble-filled environment. This
unique experience illuminates the intricate relationship between spatial
awareness and the art of musical performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于大语言模型的智能体可以通过提示个性特征和上下文数据创建高度互动的应用，但有效评估其个性特征一直具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了基于语言评估标准和人类认知学习水平的灵活问题库，通过自然语言处理模型、其他大语言模型和人类专家评估智能体响应。

Result: 研究结果揭示了纯深度学习解决方案的局限性，强调了跨学科设计在智能体开发中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 跨学科方法对于有效评估基于大语言模型的智能体个性至关重要，纯技术解决方案存在局限性。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents can be used to create highly
engaging interactive applications through prompting personality traits and
contextual data, effectively assessing their personalities has proven
challenging. This novel interdisciplinary approach addresses this gap by
combining agent development and linguistic analysis to assess the prompted
personality of LLM-based agents in a poetry explanation task. We developed a
novel, flexible question bank, informed by linguistic assessment criteria and
human cognitive learning levels, offering a more comprehensive evaluation than
current methods. By evaluating agent responses with natural language processing
models, other LLMs, and human experts, our findings illustrate the limitations
of purely deep learning solutions and emphasize the critical role of
interdisciplinary design in agent development.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MORA是一个针对言语障碍儿童的交互式故事练习系统，通过角色驱动的对话叙事嵌入目标语音，提供视觉提示和反馈，并支持AI辅助的言语治疗师工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学龄前儿童言语障碍治疗中家庭练习参与度低、现有工具互动性不足以及与临床治疗计划脱节的问题。

Method: 开发交互式故事系统，将目标语音嵌入动态对话叙事，提供视觉提示和反馈，采用AI辅助工作流程让言语治疗师配置材料、审查语音记录并调整治疗计划。

Result: 形成性研究和专家评审显示系统与现有发音治疗方法高度契合，能增强儿童参与度和识字能力，具有跨言语和语言障碍的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: MORA成功弥合了临床与家庭练习之间的差距，同时尊重专业治疗师的专业知识，为言语障碍治疗提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Speech sound disorder is among the most common communication challenges in
preschool children. Home-based practice is essential for effective therapy and
for acquiring generalization of target sounds, yet sustaining engaging and
consistent practice remains difficult. Existing story-based activities, despite
their potential for sound generalization and educational benefits, are often
underutilized due to limited interactivity. Moreover, many practice tools fail
to sufficiently integrate speech-language pathologists into the process,
resulting in weak alignment with clinical treatment plans. To address these
limitations, we present MORA, an interactive story-based practice system. MORA
introduces three key innovations. First, it embeds target sounds and vocabulary
into dynamic, character-driven conversational narratives, requiring children to
actively produce speech to progress the story, thereby creating natural
opportunities for exposure, repetition, and generalization. Second, it provides
visual cues, explicit instruction, and feedback, allowing children to practice
effectively either independently or with caregivers. Third, it supports an
AI-in-the-loop workflow, enabling SLPs to configure target materials, review
logged speech with phoneme-level scoring, and adapt therapy plans
asynchronously -- bridging the gap between clinic and home practice while
respecting professional expertise. A formative study with six licensed SLPs
informed the system's design rationale, and an expert review with seven SLPs
demonstrated strong alignment with established articulation-based treatments,
as well as potential to enhance children's engagement and literacy.
Furthermore, discussions highlight the design considerations for professional
support and configurability, adaptive and multimodal child interaction, while
highlighting MORA's broader applicability across speech and language disorders.

TL;DR: MultiColleagues是一个多代理对话系统，通过AI代理之间的对话和与用户的协作构思，展示了AI如何作为同事参与联合问题解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统主要擅长管理任务和执行预定义步骤，但在与人类进行联合问题解决和贡献新想法方面能力有限。

Method: 开发了MultiColleagues多代理对话系统，让AI代理像同事一样相互对话、分享新想法，并积极邀请用户参与协作构思。通过20名参与者的组内研究，与单代理基线进行比较。

Result: MultiColleagues增强了社会存在感感知，产生的想法在质量和新颖性方面评分显著更高，并鼓励了更深入的阐述。

Conclusion: 研究表明AI代理有潜力超越流程合作伙伴的角色，成为能够共享意图、增强群体动态并与人类协作推进想法的同事。

Abstract: Most AI systems today are designed to manage tasks and execute predefined
steps. This makes them effective for process coordination but limited in their
ability to engage in joint problem-solving with humans or contribute new ideas.
We introduce MultiColleagues, a multi-agent conversational system that shows
how AI agents can act as colleagues by conversing with each other, sharing new
ideas, and actively involving users in collaborative ideation. In a
within-subjects study with 20 participants, we compared MultiColleagues to a
single-agent baseline. Results show that MultiColleagues fostered stronger
perceptions of social presence, produced ideas rated significantly higher in
quality and novelty, and encouraged deeper elaboration. These findings
demonstrate the potential of AI agents to move beyond process partners toward
colleagues that share intent, strengthen group dynamics, and collaborate with
humans to advance ideas.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文通过系统文献综述分析了176篇关于LLM多模态系统在人类社交行为解释中的应用，发现现有研究存在模式识别为主、语言优先、静态评估和伦理讨论不全面等问题，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解研究人员如何应用多模态模型的'社交能力'，因为虽然LLM驱动的多模态系统越来越多地用于解释人类社交行为，但相关应用方式仍不明确。

Method: 采用四维编码框架（应用、技术、评估和伦理）对176篇跨领域出版物进行系统文献综述。

Result: 发现：(1)多使用模式识别和信息提取，但缺乏自适应交互推理；(2)主导的'模态到文本'管道优先语言而非丰富视听线索；(3)评估依赖静态基准，缺乏社会基础的人类中心评估；(4)伦理讨论主要关注法律风险，忽视社会风险。

Conclusion: 提出了评估社交能力、伦理意识和交互感知的多模态系统的研究议程。

Abstract: LLM-powered multimodal systems are increasingly used to interpret human
social behavior, yet how researchers apply the models' 'social competence'
remains poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic literature review
of 176 publications across different application domains (e.g., healthcare,
education, and entertainment). Using a four-dimensional coding framework
(application, technical, evaluative, and ethical), we find (1) frequent use of
pattern recognition and information extraction from multimodal sources, but
limited support for adaptive, interactive reasoning; (2) a dominant
'modality-to-text' pipeline that privileges language over rich audiovisual
cues, striping away nuanced social cues; (3) evaluation practices reliant on
static benchmarks, with socially grounded, human-centered assessments rare; and
(4) Ethical discussions focused mainly on legal and rights-related risks (e.g.,
privacy), leaving societal risks (e.g., deception) overlooked--or at best
acknowledged but left unaddressed. We outline a research agenda for evaluating
socially competent, ethically informed, and interaction-aware multi-modal
systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究通过对象回忆作为代理指标，探索移动增强现实(AR)中的注意力机制，开发了基于PLS-SEM的认知攻击防护模型，能够预测AR体验中对象的回忆概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究移动AR中用户对物理和虚拟对象的回忆能力差异，防止恶意攻击者利用认知漏洞让用户遗忘关键任务对象，保护AR用户体验安全。

Method: 整合四个移动AR研究的数据（共1,152个对象回忆测试），使用偏最小二乘结构方程模型(PLS-SEM)构建预测模型，并与随机森林和多层感知器分类器进行基准比较。

Result: PLS-SEM在四个研究中的三个取得了最佳F1分数，识别出光照、增强密度、AR配准稳定性、认知负荷和AR熟悉度为主要驱动因素，能够输出每个对象的回忆概率。

Conclusion: PLS-SEM在移动AR中提供了具有竞争力的预测准确性，同时具备可解释的设计和评估杠杆，当预测回忆率下降时可驱动界面调整，有效防御认知攻击。

Abstract: We study attention in mobile Augmented Reality (AR) using object recall as a
proxy outcome. We observe that the ability to recall an object (physical or
virtual) that was encountered in a mobile AR experience depends on many
possible impact factors and attributes, with some objects being readily
recalled while others are not, and some people recalling objects overall much
better or worse than others. This opens up a potential cognitive attack in
which adversaries might create conditions that make an AR user not recall
certain potentially mission-critical objects. We explore whether a calibrated
predictor of object recall can help shield against such cognitive attacks. We
pool data from four mobile AR studies (with a total of 1,152 object recall
probes) and fit a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM)
with formative Object, Scene, and User State composites predicting recall, also
benchmarking against Random Forest and multilayer perceptron classifiers.
PLS-SEM attains the best F1 score in three of four studies. Additionally, path
estimates identify lighting, augmentation density, AR registration stability,
cognitive load, and AR familiarity as primary drivers. The model outputs
per-object recall probabilities that can drive interface adjustments when
predicted recall falls. Overall, PLS-SEM provides competitive accuracy with
interpretable levers for design and evaluation in mobile AR.

*Hiroki Nakano,Jo Takezawa,Fabrice Matulic,Chi-Lan Yang,Koji Yatani*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究显示，披露AI写作支持会降低读者对作者的信任度、关怀度、能力和喜爱度，特别是在社交和人际写作中影响最显著。但较高的AI素养可以减轻这些负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作支持变得普遍，了解披露AI使用如何影响读者对作者的看法成为一个关键但尚未充分探索的问题。

Method: 对261名参与者进行研究，分析990份回复，考察披露不同AI参与程度如何影响作者在六种不同沟通行为中的印象。

Result: 披露AI使用通常会削弱对作者信任度、关怀度、能力和喜爱度的感知，在社交和人际写作中下降最明显。负面感知与人类真诚度丧失、作者努力减少和AI情境不适当相关。但较高AI素养可以减轻这些负面看法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI介导作者身份的社会动态复杂性，为设计透明、情境敏感且能更好保持信任和真实性的写作系统提供了设计启示。

Abstract: As AI writing support becomes ubiquitous, how disclosing its use affects
reader perception remains a critical, underexplored question. We conducted a
study with 261 participants to examine how revealing varying levels of AI
involvement shifts author impressions across six distinct communicative acts.
Our analysis of 990 responses shows that disclosure generally erodes
perceptions of trustworthiness, caring, competence, and likability, with the
sharpest declines in social and interpersonal writing. A thematic analysis of
participants' feedback links these negative shifts to a perceived loss of human
sincerity, diminished author effort, and the contextual inappropriateness of
AI. Conversely, we find that higher AI literacy mitigates these negative
perceptions, leading to greater tolerance or even appreciation for AI use. Our
results highlight the nuanced social dynamics of AI-mediated authorship and
inform design implications for creating transparent, context-sensitive writing
systems that better preserve trust and authenticity.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于VR的导盲犬训练系统，通过全景视觉和触觉反馈帮助新手训练师学习导盲犬行为识别和正确指令发出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 导盲犬对视力障碍人士的独立出行至关重要，但专业训练师数量有限。新手训练师目前主要通过观察专家或视频学习，缺乏沉浸感，难以从训练师视角理解行为和同步指令时机。

Method: 构建VR辅助平台，集成全景视觉模块（提供上下文指导、姿势对比）和触觉反馈模块（提供指令手势的触觉反馈），支持多种场景和犬只熟练度的重复训练。

Result: 系统能够改善右手指令的时机、准确性和表现力，支持独立重复练习。

Conclusion: 该系统可加速技能获取、提升训练质量、缓解合格训练师短缺问题，最终增加导盲犬的可用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a VR-based guide dog training system designed to assist
novice trainers in understanding guide dog behavior and issuing appropriate
training commands. Guide dogs play a vital role in supporting independent
mobility for visually impaired individuals, yet the limited number of skilled
trainers restricts their availability. Training is highly demanding, requiring
accurate observation of the dog's status and precise command issuance,
especially through right-hand gestures. While the trainer's left hand holds the
harness to perceive haptic cues, the right hand is used to indicate directions,
maintain attention, and provide comfort, with motion patterns varying by
scenario and the dog's progress. Currently, novices learn mainly by observing
experts or watching videos, which lacks immersion and makes it difficult to
adopt the trainer's perspective for understanding behavior or synchronizing
command timing.
  To address these limitations, the proposed system introduces a VR-based
assistive platform integrating panoramic visuals and haptic feedback to create
an immersive training environment. The visual module provides contextual
guidance, including cues for command execution and real-time comparison of the
user's posture with standard actions, while the haptic module delivers tactile
feedback for command gestures. Users can re-experience training sessions across
diverse scenarios and dog proficiency levels, allowing independent and repeated
practice. By improving the timing, accuracy, and expressiveness of right-hand
commands, the system aims to accelerate skill acquisition, enhance training
quality, and mitigate the shortage of qualified trainers, ultimately increasing
the availability of guide dogs for visually impaired individuals.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在生成式AI融入儿童学习环境的背景下，家长如何通过自我导向学习(SDL)视角来感知和支持7-13岁儿童的AI素养发展。研究发现家长对AI的认知主要停留在学习工具层面，忽视了其非教育用途和风险，同时家长自身AI知识不足，常通过共同探索来与孩子共同学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI嵌入儿童学习空间，家庭面临指导其使用的新挑战。中童期(7-13岁)是关键发展阶段，儿童寻求自主权的同时父母影响仍然重要。研究旨在了解家长如何感知和支持儿童AI素养发展。

Method: 通过焦点小组访谈，与13对亲子进行讨论，分析家长对儿童AI素养发展的认知和支持方式。

Result: 家长描述了由屏幕时间、自我动机和知识增长驱动的参与阶段演变。多数家长将AI主要视为学习工具，很少考虑其非教育角色或隐私、基础设施嵌入等风险。家长承认自身AI理解不足，常采用共同探索的共学方式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了家庭如何共同构建儿童AI素养，暴露了实际期望与批判性素养之间的张力，并提供了在平衡自主与监督的同时促进自我导向学习的设计启示。

Abstract: As generative AI becomes embedded in children's learning spaces, families
face new challenges in guiding its use. Middle childhood (ages 7-13) is a
critical stage where children seek autonomy even as parental influence remains
strong. Using self-directed learning (SDL) as a lens, we examine how parents
perceive and support children's developing AI literacy through focus groups
with 13 parent-child pairs. Parents described evolving phases of engagement
driven by screen time, self-motivation, and growing knowledge. While many
framed AI primarily as a study tool, few considered its non-educational roles
or risks, such as privacy and infrastructural embedding. Parents also noted
gaps in their own AI understanding, often turning to joint exploration and
engagement as a form of co-learning. Our findings reveal how families
co-construct children's AI literacy, exposing tensions between practical
expectations and critical literacies, and provide design implications that
foster SDL while balancing autonomy and oversight.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of negative experiences in online spaces demands
urgent attention from the human-computer interaction (HCI) community. However,
research on online safety remains fragmented across different HCI subfields,
with limited communication and collaboration between disciplines. This siloed
approach risks creating ineffective responses, including design solutions that
fail to meet the diverse needs of users, and policy efforts that overlook
critical usability concerns. This workshop aims to foster interdisciplinary
dialogue on online safety by bringing together researchers from within and
beyond HCI - including but not limited to Social Computing, Digital Design,
Internet Policy, Cybersecurity, Ethics, and Social Sciences. By uniting
researchers, policymakers, industry practitioners, and community advocates we
aim to identify shared challenges in online safety research, highlight gaps in
current knowledge, and establish common research priorities. The workshop will
support the development of interdisciplinary research plans and establish
collaborative environments - both within and beyond Australia - to action them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的广泛使用给众包数据收集带来了新挑战，特别是在调查研究中，AI自动生成回复威胁实证研究的完整性，并影响对公众意见和行为的理解。

Method: 采用两种检测方法：基于LLM的检测和基于签名的检测，在七个调查研究中比较2022年前后收集的回复数据。

Result: 研究发现2022年后调查中的AI生成回复显著增加，表明生成式AI可能无声地扭曲众包数据质量。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可能损害数据质量、误导研究人员并影响下游研究发现，需要制定检测策略来保障研究完整性，应对这些方法和伦理挑战。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI (GenAI) has introduced new
challenges in crowdsourced data collection, particularly in survey-based
research. While GenAI offers powerful capabilities, its unintended use in
crowdsourcing, such as generating automated survey responses, threatens the
integrity of empirical research and complicates efforts to understand public
opinion and behavior. In this study, we investigate and evaluate two approaches
for detecting AI-generated responses in online surveys: LLM-based detection and
signature-based detection. We conducted experiments across seven survey
studies, comparing responses collected before 2022 with those collected after
the release of ChatGPT. Our findings reveal a significant increase in
AI-generated responses in the post-2022 studies, highlighting how GenAI may
silently distort crowdsourced data. This work raises broader concerns about
evolving landscape of data integrity, where GenAI can compromise data quality,
mislead researchers, and influence downstream findings in fields such as
health, politics, and social behavior. By surfacing detection strategies and
empirical evidence of GenAI's impact, we aim to contribute to ongoing
conversation about safeguarding research integrity and supporting scholars
navigating these methodological and ethical challenges.

Abstract: Maintaining physical activity is essential for older adults' health and
well-being, yet participation remains low. Traditional paper-based and
in-person interventions have been effective but face scalability issues.
Smartphone apps offer a potential solution, but their effectiveness in
real-world use remains underexplored. Most prior studies take place in
controlled environments, use specialized hardware, or rely on in-person
training sessions or researcher-led setup. This study examines the feasibility
and engagement of Senior Fit, a standalone mobile fitness app designed for
older adults. We conducted continuous testing with 25 participants aged 65-85,
refining the app based on their feedback to improve usability and
accessibility. Our findings underscore both the potential and key challenges in
designing digital health interventions. Older adults valued features such as
video demonstrations and reminders that made activity feel accessible and
motivating, yet some expressed frustration with manual logging and limited
personalization. The Facebook group provided encouragement for some but
excluded others unfamiliar with the platform. These results highlight the need
for fitness apps that integrate flexible tracking, clear feedback, and
low-barrier social support. We contribute design recommendations for creating
inclusive mobile fitness tools that align with older adults' routines and
capabilities, offering insights for future long-term, real-world deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型可以快速预测接近最优的线路切换决策，但在实际部署前需要验证其对网络运行的影响，特别是最坏情况下的负载削减。

Method: 训练神经网络解决最优电力线路切换问题，采用双层攻击者-防御者验证方法，结合AC物理的凸松弛和局部神经网络搜索来找到最坏情况负载削减的下界。

Result: 优化方法始终比随机采样方法找到更大的负载削减，在多个PGLib测试案例和包含超过1000万参数的神经网络模型上验证有效。

Conclusion: 提出的验证方法能够有效评估神经网络决策在最坏情况下的性能影响，为机器学习模型在电力系统中的应用提供了重要安全保障。

Abstract: Solving for globally optimal line switching decisions in AC transmission
grids can be intractability slow. Machine learning (ML) models, meanwhile, can
be trained to predict near-optimal decisions at a fraction of the speed.
Verifying the performance and impact of these ML models on network operation,
however, is a critically important step prior to their actual deployment. In
this paper, we train a Neural Network (NN) to solve the optimal power shutoff
line switching problem. To assess the worst-case load shedding induced by this
model, we propose a bilevel attacker-defender verification approach that finds
the NN line switching decisions that cause the highest quantity of network load
shedding. Solving this problem to global optimality is challenging (due to AC
power flow and NN nonconvexities), so our approach exploits a convex relaxation
of the AC physics, combined with a local NN search, to find a guaranteed lower
bound on worst--case load shedding. These under-approximation bounds are solved
via MathOptAI.jl. We benchmark against a random sampling approach, and we find
that our optimization-based approach always finds larger load shedding. Test
results are collected on multiple PGLib test cases and on trained NN models

Abstract: Cardiac auscultation is an essential clinical skill, requiring excellent
hearing to distinguish subtle differences in timing and pitch of heart sounds.
However, diagnosing solely from these sounds is often challenging due to
interference from surrounding noise, and the information may be limited.
Existing solutions that adaptively cancel external noise are either not
real-time or are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for
implementation in a portable system. This work proposes an end-to-end system
with a real-time adaptive noise cancellation pipeline integrated into a device
that simultaneously acquires electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG)
signals. The performance of the system is validated using real-world hospital
noise datasets and recordings captured with the dual-modality device. For PCG
and ECG signals recorded from the device in noisy hospital settings, the
proposed algorithms achieved signal-to-noise ratio improvements of 37.01 dB and
30.32 dB, respectively. These results demonstrate the systems effectiveness in
enabling reliable and accessible cardiac screening, including noisy hospital
environments typical of resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无电池物联网设备因环境能量收集的随机性和时变性导致的长期任务完成率低的问题，需要设计最优的任务调度策略来应对能量变化。

Method: 采用马尔可夫决策过程框架处理能量变化，定义了两个适当的奖励函数，推导出最优固定阈值调度策略。

Result: OSTB策略相比ALAP策略实现了8.6%的任务完成率提升，65%的电源故障减少，以及86.29%的任务执行延迟降低。

Conclusion: 基于MDP的最优固定阈值调度策略能有效提升无电池物联网设备的任务完成率，显著优于传统调度方法。

Abstract: Realizing high long-term task completion rates represents a fundamental
challenge in battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) devices powered by ambient
energy harvesting. This difficulty is primarily due to the stochastic and
time-varying characteristics of the available energy, which significantly
complicate the design of optimal task scheduling policies. In this paper, we
consider a battery-less IoT device that must periodically report sensing
measurements to a monitoring center. We adopt the Markov decision process (MDP)
framework to handle energy variability while aiming to maximize the long-term
task completion rate. For this, we first identify its components and then
define two appropriate reward functions. We demonstrate the inherent properties
associated with the MDP formulation and the related optimal policy.
Subsequently, we solve the resulting optimization problem, leading to the
optimal stationary threshold-based (OSTB) scheduling. Simulation results
demonstrate that OSTB outperforms the well-known ``as late as possible'' (ALAP)
scheduling strategy. For instance, an $8.6\%$ increase in the task completion
rate, along with a $65\%$ reduction in power failures and a $86.29\%$ decrease
in execution delays during task execution are registered assuming a $4.7$ mF
capacitor.

Abstract: The increasing integration of intermittent distributed energy resources
(DERs) has introduced significant variability in distribution networks, posing
challenges to voltage regulation and reactive power management. This paper
presents a novel neural two-stage stochastic Volt-VAR optimization (2S-VVO)
method for three-phase unbalanced distribution systems considering network
reconfiguration under uncertainty. To address the computational intractability
associated with solving large-scale scenario-based 2S-VVO problems, a
learning-based acceleration strategy is introduced, wherein the second-stage
recourse model is approximated by a neural network. This neural approximation
is embedded into the optimization model as a mixed-integer linear program
(MILP), enabling effective enforcement of operational constraints related to
the first-stage decisions. Numerical simulations on a 123-bus unbalanced
distribution system demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 50
times speedup compared to conventional solvers and decomposition methods, while
maintaining a typical optimality gap below 0.30%. These results underscore the
method's efficacy and scalability in addressing large-scale stochastic VVO
problems under practical operating conditions.

Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale
electricity markets, as mandated by FERC Order 2222, imposes new challenges on
system operations. To remain consistent with existing market structures,
regional transmission organizations (RTOs) have advanced the aggregation of
transmission-node-level DERs (T-DERs), where a nodal virtual power plant (VPP)
represents the mapping of all distribution-level DERs to their respective
transmission nodes. This paper develops a real-time economic dispatch (RTED)
framework that enables multi-transmission-node DER aggregation while addressing
computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a spatio-temporal graph
convolutional network (ST-GCN) for adaptive prediction of distribution factors
(DFs), thereby capturing the dynamic influence of individual T-DERs across the
transmission system. Furthermore, an iterative constraint identification
strategy is incorporated to alleviate transmission security constraints without
compromising system reliability. Together, these innovations accelerate the
market clearing process and support the effective participation of T-DER
aggregators under current market paradigms. The proposed approach is validated
on large-scale test systems, including modified 118-, 2383-, and 3012-bus
networks under a rolling RTED setting with real demand data. Numerical results
demonstrate significant improvements in reducing operational costs and
maintaining transmission network feasibility, underscoring the scalability and
practicality of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统化框架来分析自动驾驶系统中各种数据融合模式及其性能影响，通过ILP优化方法生成确定性离线调度，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DAG调度方法过度简化数据融合任务，假设固定触发机制，无法捕捉真实自动驾驶软件栈中多样的融合模式。

Method: 建模三种不同的融合任务类型：定时触发、等待所有和立即融合；采用基于整数线性规划(ILP)的方法优化多个实时性能指标。

Result: 在真实自动驾驶案例研究、树莓派实现和随机生成DAG上的评估表明，该框架能处理现有工作范围之外的多种融合模式，在可比场景中实现显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够全面表示真实世界的融合行为，生成可直接应用于实际平台的确定性离线调度，解决了现有方法在融合模式建模方面的局限性。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are
widely used to model complex data dependencies and inter-task communication.
However, existing DAG scheduling approaches oversimplify data fusion tasks by
assuming fixed triggering mechanisms, failing to capture the diverse fusion
patterns found in real-world ADS software stacks. In this paper, we propose a
systematic framework for analyzing various fusion patterns and their
performance implications in ADS. Our framework models three distinct fusion
task types: timer-triggered, wait-for-all, and immediate fusion, which
comprehensively represent real-world fusion behaviors. Our Integer Linear
Programming (ILP)-based approach enables an optimization of multiple real-time
performance metrics, including reaction time, time disparity, age of
information, and response time, while generating deterministic offline
schedules directly applicable to real platforms. Evaluation using real-world
ADS case studies, Raspberry Pi implementation, and randomly generated DAGs
demonstrates that our framework handles diverse fusion patterns beyond the
scope of existing work, and achieves substantial performance improvements in
comparable scenarios.

Result: 降阶模型合理复制了温度和烟雾趋势，与真实数据集高度一致。

Conclusion: 降阶模型为地下采矿中锂离子电池热失控传播提供了可行且有效的模拟解决方案。

Abstract: Large-format lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) provide effective energy storage
solutions for high-power equipment used in underground mining operations. They
have high Columbic efficiency and minimal heat and emission footprints.
However, improper use of LIBs, accidents, or other factors may increase the
probability of thermal runaway (TR), a rapid combustion reaction that
discharges toxic and flammable substances. Several such incidents have been
documented in mines. Since repeatable TR experiments to uncover the
transient-state propagation of TR are expensive and hazardous, high-fidelity
models are usually developed to mimic the impact of these events. They are
resource-intensive and are impractical to develop for many scenarios that could
be observed in a mine. Therefore, dynamic models within a reduced-order
framework were constructed to represent the transient-state combustion event.
Reduced order models (ROMs) reasonably replicate trends in temperature and
smoke, showing strong alignment with the ground-truth dataset.

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles (CAEV) is the solution to the
future smart mobility having benefits of efficient traffic flow and cleaner

Conclusion: 该样本基MHE方法能够有效处理不规则采样数据，为线性系统建立了样本可观测性与样本i-IOSS之间的联系，提供了验证采样策略的理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sample-based moving horizon estimation (MHE)
scheme for general nonlinear systems to estimate the current system state using
irregularly and/or infrequently available measurements. The cost function of
the MHE optimization problem is suitably designed to accommodate these
irregular output sequences. We also establish that, under a suitable
sample-based detectability condition known as sample-based incremental
input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS), the proposed sample-based MHE
achieves robust global exponential stability (RGES). Additionally, for the case
of linear systems, we draw connections between sample-based observability and
sample-based i-IOSS. This demonstrates that previously established conditions
for linear systems to be sample-based observable can be utilized to verify or
design sampling strategies that satisfy the conditions to guarantee RGES of the
sample-based MHE. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed sample-based MHE
is illustrated through a simulation example.

Conclusion: 该混合建模框架成功解决了气动干燥过程的建模挑战，实现了高精度预测并确保闭环控制的稳定性。

Abstract: Pneumatic drying processes in industries such as agriculture, chemicals,and
pharmaceuticals are notoriously difficult to model and control due to
multi-source disturbances,coupled stage dynamics, and significant measurement
delays. Traditional modeling paradigms often fail to simultaneously deliver
accuracy, interpretability, and closed-loop applicability. To address this
challenge, this paper introduces a unified hybrid modeling framework, termed
Physics-Guided Residual Lifting with Control-Consistent Correction,which
integrates a transient mechanistic model with a stability-constrained
data-driven component. The framework covers the complete process chain of
drying, transport, and winnowing. On the mechanistic level, the model unifies
mass transfer dynamics using the partial pressure difference of water vapor,
incorporates water activity clamping and latent heat corrections for bound
water, and ensures energy closure with moisture-dependent specific heat. On the
data-driven level,we propose an orthogonal residual learning scheme. It
leverages intermediate states from the mechanistic model as proxy variables to
construct a physics-inspired dictionary, preventing parameter compensation and
overfitting during ridge regression. Furthermore, to ensure suitability for
predictive control, a Control-Consistent Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition
with stability constraints is employed to learn the residual dynamics, for
which we provide boundedness proofs and stability guarantees. The framework was
validated on 10 industrial batches, comprising 63,000 samples. On unseen test
data, the hybrid model achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 0.016% for outlet
moisture and 0.015 {\deg}C for outlet temperature, with values improving to
0.986 and 0.995, respectively. The resulting prediction residuals exhibit
white-noise characteristics, with significantly reduced spectral energy at low
frequencies.

Abstract: This paper presents the development and validation of a digital twin for a
scaled-down electric vehicle (EV) emulator, designed to replicate longitudinal
vehicle dynamics under diverse operating conditions. The emulator integrates a
separately excited DC motor (SEDCM), a four-quadrant DC-DC converter, a battery
emulator, and a mechanical load emulator. The system models tractive effort,
aerodynamic drag, and gradient resistance using Newton's second law. In
contrast to conventional graphical modeling tools (e.g., block diagrams and
bond graphs), the adopted Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) framework
offers clear advantages by explicitly representing energy interactions and
facilitating the systematic derivation of control structures. A control
strategy developed within this framework governs energy flow across the
powertrain, enabling accurate speed control via armature voltage regulation.
Experimental tests conducted on a Lucas-Nulle test bench show strong
correlation with simulation results. The study also introduces a methodology to
compute the maximum admissible vehicle mass - determined to be 13.5 kg for a
180 W motor operating at 1900 rpm - based on acceleration and slope
constraints. Furthermore, a switching algorithm for the bidirectional converter
ensures reliable four quadrant operation. Overall, the proposed framework
provides a scalable and effective approach for EV emulation, control design,
and energy management validation.

Abstract: Neural-network-based controllers (NNCs) can represent complex, highly
nonlinear control laws, but verifying the closed-loop stability of dynamical
systems using them remains challenging. This work presents contributions to a
state-of-the-art stability verification procedure for NNC-controlled systems
which relies on semialgebraic-set-based input-output modeling to pose the
search for a Lyapunov function as an optimization problem. Specifically, this
procedure's conservatism when analyzing NNCs using transcendental activation
functions and the restriction to feedforward NNCs are addressed by a)
introducing novel semialgebraic activation functions that preserve key
properties of common transcendental activations and b) proving compatibility of
NNCs from the broader class of recurrent equilibrium networks (RENs) with this
procedure. Furthermore, the indirect optimization of a local region of
attraction (RoA) estimate using a restricted set of candidate Lyapunov
functions is greatly improved via c) the introduction of a richer
parameterization of candidate Lyapunov functions than previously reported and
d) the formulation of novel semidefinite programs (SDPs) that directly optimize
the resulting RoA estimate. The value of these contributions is highlighted in
two numerical examples.

canonical phase description of parametric oscillator Ising machines by starting
from the Stuart-Landau oscillator model -- the canonical normal form near a
Hopf bifurcation, and a natural reduced description for many parametric
oscillator implementations such as the degenerate optical parametric oscillator
(DOPO) among others. The resulting phase dynamics combine the usual
phase-difference coupling observed in the standard Kuramoto model along with an
intrinsic phase sum term that is generated when conjugate coupling is
considered. Moreover, our formulation helps explain why explicit
second-harmonic driving is unnecessary in parametric oscillators and also
reveals how quasi-steady amplitude heterogeneity scales the original strength
of the spin interaction with potentially adverse impacts on the solution
quality. Our work helps develop a unifying view of the oscillator-based
approach to designing Ising machines.

Motivation: 人脑具有高度适应性，其功能连接在认知和学习过程中会动态重构，而传统人工神经网络的学习率调整通常依赖于手动调优或通用自适应优化器，缺乏对模型内部动态的感知。

Method: CG-ALR方法在每个训练迭代中从神经元共激活构建功能连接组，并根据连接组重构状态在线调整学习率：在不稳定重构时减慢学习，在稳定组织出现时加速学习。

Result: 该方法在深度学习中的表现优于传统的SGD调度和近期方法，证明了脑连接组学原理可以为自适应学习率设计提供有效指导。

Conclusion: 脑连接组学启发的机制能够有效适应网络的动态功能组织，为深度学习中的自适应学习率设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The human brain is highly adaptive: its functional connectivity reconfigures
on multiple timescales during cognition and learning, enabling flexible
information processing. By contrast, artificial neural networks typically rely
on manually-tuned learning-rate schedules or generic adaptive optimizers whose
hyperparameters remain largely agnostic to a model's internal dynamics. In this
paper, we propose Connectome-Guided Automatic Learning Rate (CG-ALR) that
dynamically constructs a functional connectome of the neural network from
neuron co-activations at each training iteration and adjusts learning rates
online as this connectome reconfigures. This connectomics-inspired mechanism
adapts step sizes to the network's dynamic functional organization, slowing
learning during unstable reconfiguration and accelerating it when stable
organization emerges. Our results demonstrate that principles inspired by brain
connectomes can inform the design of adaptive learning rates in deep learning,
generally outperforming traditional SGD-based schedules and recent methods.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are one of the most promising bio-inspired
neural networks models and have drawn increasing attention in recent years. The
event-driven communication mechanism of SNNs allows for sparse and
theoretically low-power operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. However,
the binary nature of instantaneous spikes also leads to considerable
information loss in SNNs, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-level spiking neuron model able to provide both
low-quantization error and minimal inference latency while approaching the
performance of full precision Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Experimental
results with popular network architectures and datasets, show that multi-level
spiking neurons provide better information compression, allowing therefore a
reduction in latency without performance loss. When compared to binary SNNs on
image classification scenarios, multi-level SNNs indeed allow reducing by 2 to
3 times the energy consumption depending on the number of quantization
intervals. On neuromorphic data, our approach allows us to drastically reduce
the inference latency to 1 timestep, which corresponds to a compression factor
of 10 compared to previously published results. At the architectural level, we
propose a new residual architecture that we call Sparse-ResNet. Through a
careful analysis of the spikes propagation in residual connections we highlight
a spike avalanche effect, that affects most spiking residual architectures.
Using our Sparse-ResNet architecture, we can provide state-of-the-art accuracy
results in image classification while reducing by more than 20% the network
activity compared to the previous spiking ResNets.
