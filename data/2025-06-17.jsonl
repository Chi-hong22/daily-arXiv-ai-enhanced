In this model, it is known\nthat: (i) proportional allocations can be computed using $O(n \\log n)$ queries,\nand this is optimal for deterministic protocols; (ii) envy-free allocations (a\nsubset of proportional allocations) can be computed using $O\\left(\nn^{n^{n^{n^{n^{n}}}}} \\right)$ queries, and the best known lower bound is\n$\\Omega(n^2)$; (iii) perfect allocations (a subset of envy-free allocations)\ncannot be computed using a bounded (in $n$) number of queries.\n  In this work, we introduce two hierarchies of new fairness notions:\nComplement Harmonically Bounded (CHB) and Complement Linearly Bounded (CLB).\nIntuitively, these notions of fairness ask that, for every agent $i$, the\ncollective value that a group of agents has (from the perspective of agent $i$)\nis limited. CHB-$k$ and CLB-$k$ coincide with proportionality for $k=1$. For\nall $k \\leq n$, CHB-$k$ allocations are a superset of envy-free allocations\n(i.e., easier to find).

Many authors have proposed a probabilistic framework\nto soften the axiomatic approach. Instead of immediately passing to random\npreference profiles, we begin by measuring the degree to which an axiom is\nupheld or violated on a given profile. We focus on two foundational\naxioms-Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) and Unanimity (U)-and\nextend them to take values in $[0,1]$. Our $\\sigma_{IIA}$ measures the\nstability of a voting rule when candidates are removed from consideration,\nwhile $\\sigma_{U}$ captures the degree to which the outcome respects majority\npreferences. Together, these metrics quantify how a voting rule navigates the\nfundamental trade-off highlighted by Arrow's Theorem. We show that\n$\\sigma_{IIA}\\equiv 1$ recovers classical IIA, and $\\sigma_{U}>0$ recovers\nclassical Unanimity, allowing a quantitative restatement of Arrow's Theorem. In\nthe empirical part of the paper, we test these metrics on two kinds of data: a\nset of over 1000 ranked choice preference profiles from Scottish local\nelections, and a batch of synthetic preference profiles generated with a\nBradley-Terry-type model. We use those to investigate four positional voting\nrules-Plurality, 2-Approval, 3-Approval, and the Borda rule-as well as the\niterative rule known as Single Transferable Vote (STV). The Borda rule\nconsistently receives the highest $\\sigma_{IIA}$ and $\\sigma_{U}$ scores across\nobserved and synthetic elections.

Specifically, we examine a perturbed variant of the dynamics\nof \"follow-the-regularized-leader\" (FTRL), where the players' payoff\nobservations and strategy updates are continually impacted by random shocks.\nOur findings reveal that, in a fairly precise sense, \"uncertainty favors\nextremes\": in any game, regardless of the noise level, every player's\ntrajectory of play reaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a pure strategy\nin finite time (which we estimate). Moreover, even if the player does not\nultimately settle at this strategy, they return arbitrarily close to some\n(possibly different) pure strategy infinitely often. This prompts the question\nof which sets of pure strategies emerge as robust predictions of learning under\nuncertainty. We show that (a) the only possible limits of the FTRL dynamics\nunder uncertainty are pure Nash equilibria; and (b) a span of pure strategies\nis stable and attracting if and only if it is closed under better replies.\nFinally, we turn to games where the deterministic dynamics are recurrent - such\nas zero-sum games with interior equilibria - and we show that randomness\ndisrupts this behavior, causing the stochastic dynamics to drift toward the\nboundary on average."}

Here is a clue: It depends\non the confidence of your contentions about the plant system, the detailed data\nthemselves and your appetite for failure.\n  The paper attempts to segue repeatedly between the broad philosophical\ncontext and hard engineering examples. To instantiate ideas and add detail to\nvagaries, we incorporate a number of examples, each validated by their\ndemonstrated commercial and industrial viability and each terminating with ein\nBlickwinkel or perspective in German. As David Wallace-Wells poses, before\ninvesting hundreds of billions of dollars we really ought to ask what is the\ntrillion-dollar problem which might potentially be solved. By sticking to\nindustrially proven technologies, we hope to delineate what works suitably well\nin practice or was judged worthy of the risk."}

Semivalues have been\nproposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as\ndetermining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or\nfiltering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on\nthe specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar\nscore. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a\ncomposition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual\ninstantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this\nunderspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based\nvaluations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can\ninduce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these\nvaluation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial\nstrategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute\nvalue among datapoints. Through theoretical constructions and empirical\nexamples, we demonstrate that a bad-faith valuator can manipulate utility\nspecifications to favor preferred datapoints, and that a good-faith valuator is\nleft without principled guidance to justify any particular specification.

These\nnetworks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the\nSSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio.\nHowever, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform\nin real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex,\ninvolving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are\noften benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as\nenvironmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to\ngeneralize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios,\nremains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical\nrobustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap,\nwe introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel\ndirection in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the\nmodel's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong\nperformance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio\nSSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a\ncomprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of\nhigh-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves\nmodel performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds\nperformance on standard audio SSL benchmarks. Notably, it achieves up to a\n3.9\\% improvement on the AudioSet-2M (AS-2M), reaching a mean average precision\n(mAP) of 50.2. For polyphonic datasets, SSLAM sets new SOTA in both linear\nevaluation and fine-tuning regimes with performance improvements of up to 9.1\\%\n(mAP)."}

To address these\nissues, we propose an efficient framework for the segmentation task, named\nInceptionMamba, which encodes multi-stage rich features and offers both\nperformance and computational efficiency.

Features and capabilities of\nneuromorphic dendrites are demonstrated via a benchmark drawn from experimental\nneuroscience: spike sorting.

Given a new dataset, they need to\ndetermine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the\npretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as\nmodels grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a\nbottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively.\nAddressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and\nhyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and\nmore of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data\naugmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine\nlearning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally\ndesigned for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts\nmeta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain.\nWe propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer\nVision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline\nranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune\nlarge language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform\nfinetuning foundation models. Additionally, we meta-learn data augmentation and\nsynthetic data to enhance performance in up-stream and down-stream tasks. We\nempirically show the underestimated importance of data augmentation when using\nSelf-Supervised Learning and meta-learn advanced data augmentation strategies.\nLeveraging synthetic data, we also propose to meta-learn neural synthetic data\ngenerators as proxies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments.\nAdditionally, we learn a multiple-environment world model in an in-context\nlearning fashion by purely using synthetic, randomly sampled data."}

As a result, 1000s\nof hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the\nglobe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a\nsystematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the\nutility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In\nthis work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this\nquestion. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common\nsources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object\ntypes and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with\ncontrolled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that\nwould be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical\nsettings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future\nresearchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should\ncurrent practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets\nto maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study\nyields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and\nspatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection\nand alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that\nnot only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval\nstrategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently\noutperform existing training strategies by up to 70%.

Towards robust SSL on a\nclass-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using\nunlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online.\nWe first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by\nback-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a\ndomain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are\ndesigned to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently,\nwe further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning\nwhile using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding\nnetwork is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the\nstrengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning.

In\norder to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method\nbased on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical\ntwo-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and\nsea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module\n(LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on\nland according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add\nprior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby\nreducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore\ndetection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection\nand enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration\nof the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR\nship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the\ninput data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land\nsegmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation\ninformation as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land. We\nconducted our experiments using the publicly available SSDD dataset, which\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of our network."}

Semivalues have been\nproposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as\ndetermining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or\nfiltering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on\nthe specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar\nscore. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a\ncomposition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual\ninstantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this\nunderspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based\nvaluations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can\ninduce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these\nvaluation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial\nstrategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute\nvalue among datapoints.

This paper presents a novel channel-native\nbit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where\ntransmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to\ncollectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The\nkey idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors\ncaused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved\nby designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only\ntransmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating\nthe need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the\ncatastrophic consequence of bit errors.

This allows the model to learn from both\nbehavioral patterns and rich item content, enhancing user and item\nrepresentations across temporal dimensions. By fusing sequential signals with\ntextual semantics, our approach improves the expressiveness and personalization\ncapacity of recommendation systems.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Amazon datasets, benchmarking\nC-TLSAN against state-of-the-art baselines, including recent sequential\nrecommenders based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent interaction\nhistory and predictions in text form. Empirical results demonstrate that\nC-TLSAN consistently outperforms strong baselines in next-item prediction\ntasks. Notably, it improves AUC by 1.66%, Recall@10 by 93.99%, and Precision@10\nby 94.80% on average over the best-performing baseline (TLSAN) across 10 Amazon\nproduct categories. These results highlight the value of integrating\ncontent-aware enhancements into temporal modeling frameworks for sequential\nrecommendation.

It is\nwell known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when\nreward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this\nchallenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending\nplan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design\ngeneral (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to\nbaselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our\nalgorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution\nof the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our\nmethods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly\nimbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing\nagainst benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan."}

Their construction involves aggregating criteria\nevaluations, a common practice in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). In\nMCDA, various methods have been proposed to address key aspects of multiple\ncriteria evaluations, such as the measurement scales of the criteria, the\ndegree of acceptable compensation between them, and their potential\ninteractions. However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is\nessential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well\nas the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing\nexplainable and interpretable composite indicators using \"if..., then...\"\ndecision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of\ncomposite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical\nscores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal\nqualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into\nquantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in\nthe form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is\nconstructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units\nresults from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision\nrules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the\nDominance-based Rough Set Approach. The resulting decision rules relate the\nclass assignment or unit's score to threshold conditions on values of selected\nindicators in an intelligible way, clarifying the underlying rationale.\nMoreover, they serve to recommend composite indicator assessment for new units\nof interest."}

In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data\ncan offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct\nimplications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of\ninterpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients\nrecovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of\nmultimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS\nlocation, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely\ncollected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately\nfor each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each\nmodality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware\nprompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster\nlabels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these\nclusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous\nstatistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected\nalongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical\nsignificance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large\nlanguage model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the\nproposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner.

Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic\nspatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including\nspatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints\nof spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial\ncorrelation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a\nphysics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed\nSpatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to\nintegrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating\nconstraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two\nspatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the\nlikelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial\ninteractions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the\nlearned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon\nin transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be\nexplicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel\nspatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for\nachieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic\nexperiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the\nquantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we\nextract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This\nrepresentation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the\nsemantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under\nloose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation.

Previous approaches\ncan be grouped into two primary \"meta-learner\" paradigms that impose distinct\ninductive biases. Indirect meta-learners first fit and regularize separate\npotential outcome (PO) models and then estimate CATE by taking their\ndifference, whereas direct meta-learners construct and directly regularize\nestimators for the CATE function itself. Neither approach consistently\noutperforms the other across all scenarios: indirect learners perform well when\nthe PO functions are simple, while direct learners outperform when the CATE is\nsimpler than individual PO functions. In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid\nLearner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between\nthe direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand.

It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful\nmacros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively\nenvironment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different\nperspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between\nreducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size\nof the action space.

To address this problem we\npropose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between\nactions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by\nreducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving\nexploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned\njointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy\nlooking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment.\nOur results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all\nenvironments.

For example, behaviors trained to interact with\nin-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil.\nThe key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally\ncorrespond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an\nexpert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of\ncollecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our\nmethod: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current\nobservations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training\nobservations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence\nfeedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD\nobservations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform\ndeployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse\nreal-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator.\nOur results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the\ngeneralization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and\nenvironment conditions with low feedback."}
