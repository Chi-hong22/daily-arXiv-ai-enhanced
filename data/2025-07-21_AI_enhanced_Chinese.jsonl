However, an inherent\nvulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of\ncompliant mechanisms to real-world applications. This is particularly\nchallenging in service environments where loading is complex and uncertain, and\nthe cost of failure is high. In such cases, mechanical hard stops are critical\nto prevent yielding and buckling. Conventional hard-stop designs, which rely on\nstacking single-DOF limits, must be overly restrictive in multi-DOF space to\nguarantee safety in the presence of unknown loads. In this study, we present a\nsystematic design synthesis method to guarantee overload protection in\ncompliant mechanisms by integrating coupled multi-DOF motion limits within a\nsingle pair of compact hard-stop surfaces. Specifically, we introduce a\ntheoretical and practical framework for optimizing the contact surface geometry\nto maximize the mechanisms multi-DOF working space while still ensuring that\nthe mechanism remains within its elastic regime. We apply this synthesis method\nto a case study of a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopaedic implants, and\nprovide numerical and experimental validation that the derived design offers\nreliable protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling.

In recent years, advancements in Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new\nheights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,\ntraditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting\npredefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The\nadvent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this\nlimitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can\nidentify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This\nbreakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in\naerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD\nin the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles\nof OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a\nspecialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic\ntaxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides\na comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets.

Unlike traditional Precomputed Radiance Transfer\n(PRT) methods, that require expensive offline precomputations, our learned\nmodel directly consumes CGA-based representations of vertex positions and\nnormals, enabling dynamic scene shading without precomputation. Integrated\nseamlessly into the Unity engine, Neural-GASh facilitates accurate shading of\nanimated and deformed 3D meshes - capabilities essential for dynamic,\ninteractive environments. The shading of the scene is implemented within Unity,\nwhere rotation of scene lights in terms of Spherical Harmonics is also\nperformed optimally using CGA.

The goal is to produce an $\\alpha$-MMS allocation at\nthe end. Several recent works have investigated this model, but have only\nsucceeded in obtaining non-trivial algorithms under restrictive assumptions,\nsuch as the two-agent bi-valued special case (Wang and Wei, 2025), or by\nassuming knowledge of the total disutility of each agent (Zhou, Bai, and Wu,\n2023). For the general case, the trivial $n$-MMS guarantee remains the best\nknown, while the strongest lower bound is still only $2$.\n  We close this gap on the negative side by proving that for any fixed $n$ and\n$\\varepsilon$, no algorithm can guarantee an $(n - \\varepsilon)$-MMS\nallocation. Notably, this lower bound holds precisely for every $n$, without\nhiding constants in big-$O$ notation, thereby exactly matching the trivial\nupper bound.\n  Despite this strong impossibility result, we also present positive results.\nWe provide an online algorithm that applies in the general case, guaranteeing a\n$\\min\\{n, O(k), O(\\log D)\\}$-MMS allocation, where $k$ is the maximum number of\ndistinct disutilities across all agents and $D$ is the maximum ratio between\nthe largest and smallest disutilities for any agent. This bound is reasonable\nacross a broad range of scenarios and, for example, implies that we can achieve\nan $O(1)$-MMS allocation whenever $k$ is constant.

To ensure safety in such\nscenarios, a safe robust control framework is proposed that leverages implicit\nneural representations. To handle arbitrary target geometries without explicit\nmodeling, a neural signed distance function (SDF) is learned from point cloud\ndata via a enhanced implicit geometric regularization method, which\nincorporates an over-apporximation strategy to create a conservative,\nsafety-prioritized boundary. The target's surface is implicitly defined by the\nzero-level set of the learned neural SDF, while the values and gradients\nprovide critical information for safety controller design. This neural SDF\nrepresentation underpins a two-layer hierarchcial safe robust control\nframework: a safe velocity generation layer and a safe robust controller layer.\nIn the first layer, a second-order cone program is formulated to generate\nsafety-guaranteed reference velocity by explicitly incorporating the\nunder-approximation error bound. Furthermore, a circulation inequality is\nintroduced to mitigate the local minimum issues commonly encountered in control\nbarrier function (CBF) methods. The second layer features an integrated\ndisturbance observer and a smooth safety filter explicitly compensating for\nestimation error, bolstering robustness to external disturbances.

However, the ability of these\nalgorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space\nbecomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the\nsolution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more\ncomplex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input\nmatrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce\nthe dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of\nthe original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using\nSCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a\nmatrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are\nthen transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the\naddition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.\nSCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series\npose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of\ncompressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension\nis no greater than the corresponding input dimension.

In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on\nscene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning\naccuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune\nmodels using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and\nevaluate their performance on CVBench.

A recent study has shown how self-aggregation\nis possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task\ninstances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach\nposes new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the\nperformance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of\nrobots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully\ncompact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask\nself-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into\ndifferent compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor.

While safety filters such as Control\nBarrier Functions (CBFs) enforce constraints by modifying nominal controllers\nin real time, they can become overly conservative when the nominal policy lacks\nsafety awareness. Conversely, solving State-Constrained Optimal Control\nProblems (SC-OCPs) via dynamic programming offers formal guarantees but is\nintractable in high-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage framework that combines gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC)\nwith CBF-based safety filtering for co-optimizing safety and performance. In\nthe first stage, we relax safety constraints as penalties in the cost function,\nenabling fast optimization via gradient-based methods. This step improves\nscalability and avoids feasibility issues associated with hard constraints. In\nthe second stage, we modify the resulting controller using a CBF-based\nQuadratic Program (CBF-QP), which enforces hard safety constraints with minimal\ndeviation from the reference. Our approach yields controllers that are both\nperformant and provably safe.

Traditional Higher Order CBFs (HOCBFs) ensure asymptotic\nsafety but lack mechanisms for fixed-time convergence, which is critical in\ntime-sensitive and safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation.\nIn contrast, our approach imposes a structured differential constraint using\nrepeated roots in the characteristic polynomial, enabling closed-form\npolynomial solutions with exact convergence at a prescribed time. We derive\nconditions on the barrier function and its derivatives that ensure forward\ninvariance and fixed-time reachability, and we provide an explicit formulation\nfor second-order systems. Our method is evaluated on three robotic systems - a\npoint-mass model, a unicycle, and a bicycle model and benchmarked against\nexisting HOCBF approaches.

The proposed method\naddresses key challenges in robotic locomotion, including accurate trajectory\ntracking under unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. By leveraging the\nrepetitive nature of periodic gaits and extending ILC to nonperiodic tasks, the\nframework enhances accuracy and generalization across diverse locomotion\nscenarios. The control architecture is data-enabled, combining a physics-based\nmodel derived from hybrid-system trajectory optimization with real-time\nlearning to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances. A\ncentral contribution is the development of a generalized TL that stores learned\ncontrol profiles and enables rapid adaptation to changes in speed, terrain, and\ngravitational conditions-eliminating the need for repeated learning and\nsignificantly reducing online computation. The approach is validated on the\nbipedal robot Cassie and the quadrupedal robot A1 through extensive simulations\nand hardware experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework\nreduces joint tracking errors by up to 85% within a few seconds and enables\nreliable execution of both periodic and nonperiodic gaits, including slope\ntraversal and terrain adaptation. Compared to state-of-the-art whole-body\ncontrollers, the learned skills eliminate the need for online computation\nduring execution and achieve control update rates exceeding 30x those of\nexisting methods.

Indeed, these types of data are, in general,\nnot represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use\nof the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of\nbarycenters.

Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled\ndecision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system\ninteractions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL\nhas generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function\napproximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's\npolicy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify\nthe issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited\ninterpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces\nmodel-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy\napproximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and\nconstraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system\nknowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions,\nwhile deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL.

The\nemotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally\nbeen considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced\nas highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This\nrelationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for\nmemorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on\nthird-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person\nexperience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,\nwe empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions\n(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational\ninteractions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of\nboth emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,\napproximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as\nonline meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship\nbetween affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished\nfrom what might be expected under random chance. We discuss the implications of\nthis surprising finding for the development and applications of Affective\nComputing technology. In addition, we contextualise our findings in broader\ndiscourses in the Affective Computing and point out important targets for\nfuture research efforts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7fa4\u4f53\u60c5\u7eea\uff08\u6109\u60a6-\u5524\u9192\uff09\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u60c5\u7eea\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u4f1a\u8bae\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u60c5\u7eea\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u60c5\u7eea\u6807\u6ce8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u6807\u6ce8\u60c5\u7eea\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5728\u7ebf\u4f1a\u8bae\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u60c5\u7eea\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u60c5\u7eea\u6807\u6ce8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

In airdrop missions, these platforms face the dual challenges of\nabrupt control mode switching and inherent system delays along with control\nerrors. To address these issues, this paper presents an autonomous airdrop\nsystem based on an aerial manipulator (AM). The introduction of additional\nactuated degrees of freedom enables active compensation for UAV tracking\nerrors.

The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on\nKoopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical\nmetadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic\nsequences to identify coherent motion patterns.

One such algorithm\nis the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO\nsuffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local\noptima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy\nImproved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random\ndisturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting\ntrapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight\nstrategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with\nflight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the\nlocal optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a\nposition update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion,\neffectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision.\nFinally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test\nfunctions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms\nacross different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its\nadvantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path\nplanning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are\nstill challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we\napply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design\nproblems to assess its feasibility in practical applications.

The simulation environment consists of three\nmonitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were\ncollected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully\nalert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness.

Traditional watermarking\ntechniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their\neffectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel\nin-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable\nconcepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable\nwatermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or\nperturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic\nattributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to\nadversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image\naugmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of\nwatermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,\ndemonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining\nimage quality.

Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to\nsample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a\nper-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to\nenhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark\ndataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters\ninstead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in\nscenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Depth3DLane\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u989d\u5916\u6df1\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76f8\u673a\u6807\u5b9a\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u76ee3D\u8f66\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u65e0\u76f8\u673a\u6807\u5b9a\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9e1f\u77b0\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u53d6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u524d\u89c6\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u7ed3\u54083D\u8f66\u9053\u951a\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u5e27\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenLane\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "Depth3DLane\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u76ee3D\u8f66\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Unlike airborne\nLiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the\naccuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it\nrelies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).\nGenerally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a\ntwo-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),\nfollowed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an\nuncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error\ncovariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry\nprocess. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose\na novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)\nper-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such\nas matching cost values) from the MVS stage.

To address this, we\nintroduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately\nreconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM\nscans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and\nexperimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow\nimplementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to\ncollect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)\nour SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that\nrequires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).\nSparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in\nMoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of\ncrystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction\nin acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM\nimage. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit\nremarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using\nclassic-flow scanning.

However, its impact on generalization under\nsubstantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely\nunexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different\nadversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and\nadversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model\narchitectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an\ninherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach\nis evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This\nbenchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training\nand test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a\ncommon real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial\ntraining strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the\nclassification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks\ndesigned to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used\nfor robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses\nthe stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.\nResults show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space\nattacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative\nand simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models.

To\nimplement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a\nmemory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for\nDM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the\nTexture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel\nFilter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes\nspatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering.

However, the generation of training\ndatasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a\ncomputational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare\nevents or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation\nmodels that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular\ndatabases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data\nnecessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach\nrequires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can\nstill be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events\nand for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.\nIn on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely\nautomated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the\nmodel is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with\nclassical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying\nthis form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to\nassess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even\nthough most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In\nthis paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach\nbased on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow\nthat automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified\naccuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them\nat an increased rate relative to their occurrence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4ece\u5934\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u529b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d8\u5f97\u6d3b\u8dc3\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bbe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

However, the sole\nusage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of\nhybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF\nrepresentation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar\ngeneration qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their\ndeformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the\ndeformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational\ncosts on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points\nare located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but\nresult in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval\non the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.\nThe delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational\ncost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important\nregions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without\nhierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the\ngeneration quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around\n20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.\nWe provide video results on https://github.com/seungjun-moon/epsilon.", "AI": {"tldr": "EPSilon\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u5c04\u7ebf\u7701\u7565\uff08ERO\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u533a\u95f4\u7701\u7565\uff08EIO\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eNeRF\u548cSMPL\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u53d8\u5f62\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0cEPSilon\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "EPSilon\u91c7\u7528ERO\u548cEIO\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7701\u7565\u7a7a\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u7a7a\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "EPSilon\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75283.9%\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620\u500d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53474\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "EPSilon\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues.

While non-graph models excel in edge-weight\nprediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior\npreservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as\nreflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although\nthe LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly\nmodeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world\nmulti-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our\nresults highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization\nperformance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly\nwell-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in\nlarge-scale multi-site SC studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\uff08SC\uff09\u8de8\u7ad9\u70b9\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u91c7\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ad9\u70b9\u6761\u4ef6\u6df1\u5ea6\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\uff09\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u867d\u6570\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9SC\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion\nrepresentation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing\napproaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video\nframes, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to\ninconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free\nEncapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both\nvisual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach\nutilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video\nframes by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing\nthem with noising and denoising steps.

Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach\ncompared to previous approaches.

Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,\nrevealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,\npersisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within\nthis idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other\nsources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid\nadaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to\ninvestigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual\nlearning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating\nconcurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to\nmodulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native\nmultitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam\nintroduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.\nInspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently\nenhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we\npropose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that\napproximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of\nknowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information.

PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The\nfirst is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO\nfeatures from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for\ncamera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency\nregularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further\noptimize the rotation matrix in camera poses.

Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in\nSSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to\nlarge codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to\naccount for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on\nnested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features\ninto increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,\nenabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional\nbiases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic\ncontent. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions\nestablish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and\nopen a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for\nthe broader AI community.
