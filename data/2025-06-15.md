Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing
precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed
for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains
challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In
this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language
models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data
collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To
enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

### [2] [Estimating the Joint Probability of Scenario Parameters with Gaussian Mixture Copula Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10098)
*Christian Reichenbächer,Philipp Rank,Jochen Hipp,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文首次将高斯混合Copula模型应用于自动驾驶系统的安全验证中，用于驾驶场景的统计建模，展示了其在数据拟合上的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶场景参数的联合概率分布对基于场景的安全评估至关重要，但现有方法（如高斯混合模型和高斯Copula模型）在表达多模态性和灵活性上存在不足。

Method: 提出高斯混合Copula模型，结合高斯混合模型的多模态表达能力和Copula的灵活性，分别建模边缘分布和依赖关系。

Result: 在1800万场景实例的评估中，高斯混合Copula模型在似然和Sinkhorn距离上优于高斯混合模型和高斯Copula模型。

Conclusion: 高斯混合Copula模型为未来基于场景的验证框架提供了更优的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

### [3] [One For All: LLM-based Heterogeneous Mission Planning in Precision Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10106)

Main category: cs.RO

Conclusion: 该研究为非技术用户提供了更易用的机器人自动化工具，推动了精准农业的普及。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

### [4] [A Navigation Framework Utilizing Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10172)
*Yicheng Duan,Kaiyu tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的视觉语言导航框架，解耦视觉语言理解与动作规划，结合轻量级逻辑实现高效导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大型视觉语言模型在计算成本和实时部署上的挑战，同时提升导航系统的灵活性和适应性。

Method: 集成冻结的视觉语言模型Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct，采用提示工程、结构化历史管理和双帧视觉输入策略。

Result: 在Room-to-Room基准测试中初步结果显示出泛化能力不足，但模块化设计为未来改进奠定基础。

Conclusion: 模块化框架为高效导航系统提供了可扩展的方向，未来可通过增强环境先验和多模态输入集成进一步优化。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

### [5] [A Unified Framework for Probabilistic Dynamic-, Trajectory- and Vision-based Virtual Fixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10239)
*Maximilian Mühlbauer,Freek Stulp,Sylvain Calinon,Alin Albu-Schäffer,João Silvério*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的概率虚拟夹具（VF）框架，支持手动、半自动和全自动模式的无缝切换，结合几何感知和最优阻抗增益，提升任务效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保持人类参与的同时，通过自适应选择最适合的触觉反馈，提高任务效率和精度，尤其是在需要高精度的任务阶段。

Method: 引入基于概率动态系统的VF用于粗引导，扩展概率位置轨迹夹具用于精确引导，并结合几何感知和阻抗行为优化。

Result: 实验验证了框架在多种机器人上的有效性，展示了多种操作模式和编程夹具的便捷性。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够灵活适应不同任务需求，显著提升任务完成效率和精度。

Abstract: Probabilistic Virtual Fixtures (VFs) enable the adaptive selection of the
most suitable haptic feedback for each phase of a task, based on learned or
perceived uncertainty. While keeping the human in the loop remains essential,
for instance, to ensure high precision, partial automation of certain task
phases is critical for productivity. We present a unified framework for
probabilistic VFs that seamlessly switches between manual fixtures,
semi-automated fixtures (with the human handling precise tasks), and full
autonomy. We introduce a novel probabilistic Dynamical System-based VF for
coarse guidance, enabling the robot to autonomously complete certain task
phases while keeping the human operator in the loop. For tasks requiring
precise guidance, we extend probabilistic position-based trajectory fixtures
with automation allowing for seamless human interaction as well as
geometry-awareness and optimal impedance gains. For manual tasks requiring very
precise guidance, we also extend visual servoing fixtures with the same
geometry-awareness and impedance behaviour. We validate our approach
experimentally on different robots, showcasing multiple operation modes and the
ease of programming fixtures.

### [6] [Innovative Adaptive Imaged Based Visual Servoing Control of 6 DoFs Industrial Robot Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10240)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种创新的前馈-反馈自适应控制算法，结合Youla参数化方法，解决了点特征在视野外时的稳定快速运动控制问题，并在视野内时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IBVS方法多依赖3D点特征在视野内，限制了应用范围。本文旨在解决点特征在视野外时的控制问题。

Method: 设计了特征估计循环，结合自适应控制器和在线线性化技术，实现稳定控制。

Result: 仿真验证了控制器的有效性和鲁棒性，适用于不同工业机器人系统。

Conclusion: 该方案鲁棒性强且易于实现，扩展了IBVS的应用场景。

Abstract: Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods have been well developed and used
in many applications, especially in pose (position and orientation) alignment.
However, most research papers focused on developing control solutions when 3D
point features can be detected inside the field of view. This work proposes an
innovative feedforward-feedback adaptive control algorithm structure with the
Youla Parameterization method. A designed feature estimation loop ensures
stable and fast motion control when point features are outside the field of
view. As 3D point features move inside the field of view, the IBVS feedback
loop preserves the precision of the pose at the end of the control period.
Also, an adaptive controller is developed in the feedback loop to stabilize the
system in the entire range of operations. The nonlinear camera and robot
manipulator model is linearized and decoupled online by an adaptive algorithm.
The adaptive controller is then computed based on the linearized model
evaluated at current linearized point. The proposed solution is robust and easy
to implement in different industrial robotic systems. Various scenarios are
used in simulations to validate the effectiveness and robust performance of the
proposed controller.

### [7] [A Novel Feedforward Youla Parameterization Method for Avoiding Local Minima in Stereo Image Based Visual Servoing Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10252)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型控制策略，用于精确校准立体相机的位姿，避免局部最小值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人导航和操作中，相机位姿的精确确定对任务执行至关重要，但现有方法在视觉伺服控制中可能陷入局部最小值。

Method: 结合前馈控制器和基于Youla参数化的反馈控制器，确保鲁棒的伺服性能。

Result: 仿真表明，该方法有效避免局部最小值，使相机准确高效到达目标位姿。

Conclusion: 提出的控制策略解决了视觉伺服中的全局稳定性问题，提升了相机位姿估计的准确性。

Abstract: In robot navigation and manipulation, accurately determining the camera's
pose relative to the environment is crucial for effective task execution. In
this paper, we systematically prove that this problem corresponds to the
Perspective-3-Point (P3P) formulation, where exactly three known 3D points and
their corresponding 2D image projections are used to estimate the pose of a
stereo camera. In image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control, the system
becomes overdetermined, as the 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the stereo camera
must align with 9 observed 2D features in the scene. When more constraints are
imposed than available DoFs, global stability cannot be guaranteed, as the
camera may become trapped in a local minimum far from the desired configuration
during servoing. To address this issue, we propose a novel control strategy for
accurately positioning a calibrated stereo camera. Our approach integrates a
feedforward controller with a Youla parameterization-based feedback controller,
ensuring robust servoing performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that
our method effectively avoids local minima and enables the camera to reach the
desired pose accurately and efficiently.

### [8] [Learning Safe Control via On-the-Fly Bandit Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10279)
*Alexandre Capone,Ryan Cosner,Aaaron Ames,Sandra Hirche*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合控制屏障函数和高斯过程的方法，用于在模型不确定性高时确保控制任务的安全性，无需备用控制器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在模型不确定性高时，传统安全过滤器可能失效的问题，同时避免依赖备用控制器。

Method: 使用高斯过程带算法动态收集数据，结合控制屏障函数生成鲁棒性安全证书，并通过探索机制确保数据有助于系统安全。

Result: 方法在零均值先验动力学模型下可证明安全性，无需备用控制器。

Conclusion: 这是首个无需备用控制器即可实现安全性的学习型控制方法。

Abstract: Control tasks with safety requirements under high levels of model uncertainty
are increasingly common. Machine learning techniques are frequently used to
address such tasks, typically by leveraging model error bounds to specify
robust constraint-based safety filters. However, if the learned model
uncertainty is very high, the corresponding filters are potentially invalid,
meaning no control input satisfies the constraints imposed by the safety
filter. While most works address this issue by assuming some form of safe
backup controller, ours tackles it by collecting additional data on the fly
using a Gaussian process bandit-type algorithm. We combine a control barrier
function with a learned model to specify a robust certificate that ensures
safety if feasible. Whenever infeasibility occurs, we leverage the control
barrier function to guide exploration, ensuring the collected data contributes
toward the closed-loop system safety. By combining a safety filter with
exploration in this manner, our method provably achieves safety in a setting
that allows for a zero-mean prior dynamics model, without requiring a backup
controller. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first safe learning-based
control method that achieves this.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度贝叶斯优化方法，用于控制核聚变中的撕裂不稳定性，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核聚变系统动态复杂、数据稀缺且硬件易故障，现有机器学习工具无法全面解决这些问题。

Method: 结合高频数据驱动动态模型与低频高斯过程，通过实验间更新高斯过程快速适应新数据。

Result: 离线测试显著优于基线；现场实验在DIII-D托卡马克中成功率提高117%。

Conclusion: 多尺度贝叶斯优化方法在复杂动态系统中表现优异，为核聚变控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms often struggle to control complex real-world
systems. In the case of nuclear fusion, these challenges are exacerbated, as
the dynamics are notoriously complex, data is poor, hardware is subject to
failures, and experiments often affect dynamics beyond the experiment's
duration. Existing tools like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and
Bayesian optimization address some of these challenges but fail to provide a
comprehensive solution. To overcome these limitations, we present a multi-scale
Bayesian optimization approach that integrates a high-frequency data-driven
dynamics model with a low-frequency Gaussian process. By updating the Gaussian
process between experiments, the method rapidly adapts to new data, refining
the predictions of the less reliable dynamical model. We validate our approach
by controlling tearing instabilities in the DIII-D nuclear fusion plant.
Offline testing on historical data shows that our method significantly
outperforms several baselines. Results on live experiments on the DIII-D
tokamak, conducted under high-performance plasma scenarios prone to
instabilities, shows a 50% success rate, marking a 117% improvement over
historical outcomes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级方法，通过结合OSM地图的结构化道路元数据和道路设计手册中的车道宽度先验，改进了基于地图先验的车道拓扑预测模型SMERF，提升了车道和交通元素检测及其关联的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车道拓扑预测对自动驾驶导航至关重要，而道路环境信息通常遵循自然语言编码的惯例（如设计规范和道路名称），因此需要将这些信息整合到预测模型中以提高准确性。

Method: 通过结合OSM地图的结构化道路元数据和道路设计手册中的车道宽度先验，对SMERF模型进行轻量级增强，利用道路中心线编码实现车道拓扑预测。

Result: 在两个地理多样化的复杂交叉口场景中，该方法在车道和交通元素检测及其关联方面均表现出改进，并通过四种拓扑感知指标全面评估了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够泛化并适应多样化的拓扑结构和条件，证明了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过稀疏标记的真实工业数据自主学习机器人操作的方法，显著提升了多吸盘机器人抓取的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仓库等实际场景中从杂乱堆中抓取多样化物品的挑战，同时满足高吞吐量的延迟要求。

Method: 利用多模态视觉编码器（RGB、深度和语义分割）预测抓取成功率，结合多模态预训练和微调策略。

Result: 在大规模物品抓取数据集、部分遮挡数据集和包裹抓取数据集上进行了全面评估，展示了多模态训练的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态预训练能学习模态间关系，微调和推理时可仅使用部分模态输入，但仍需多模态训练以优化性能。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

### [12] [Towards more efficient quantitative safety validation of residual risk for assisted and automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10363)
*Daniel Betschinske,Malte Schrimpf,Steven Peters,Kamil Klonecki,Jan Peter Karch,Moritz Lippert*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了提升高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）和自动驾驶系统（ADS）安全验证效率的方法，分析了减少实地操作测试（FOT）需求的现有方法及其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FOT方法在高自动化级别下测试效率低且成本高，促使研究更高效的验证方法。

Method: 基于ISO 21448标准，提出通用模型和基础模型，评估现有减少FOT需求的方法。

Result: 评估显示现有方法虽有一定潜力，但均存在不足，无法完全替代FOT。

Conclusion: FOT在ADAS和ADS安全验证中仍不可或缺，需进一步研究改进方法。

Abstract: The safety validation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
Automated Driving Systems (ADS) increasingly demands efficient and reliable
methods to quantify residual risk while adhering to international standards
such as ISO 21448. Traditionally, Field Operational Testing (FOT) has been
pivotal for macroscopic safety validation of automotive driving functions up to
SAE automation level 2. However, state-of-the-art derivations for empirical
safety demonstrations using FOT often result in impractical testing efforts,
particularly at higher automation levels. Even at lower automation levels, this
limitation - coupled with the substantial costs associated with FOT - motivates
the exploration of approaches to enhance the efficiency of FOT-based
macroscopic safety validation. Therefore, this publication systematically
identifies and evaluates state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT,
including novel methods reported in the literature. Based on an analysis of ISO
21448, two models are derived: a generic model capturing the argumentation
components of the standard, and a base model, exemplarily applied to Automatic
Emergency Braking (AEB) systems, establishing a baseline for the real-world
driving requirement for a Quantitative Safety Validation of Residual Risk
(QSVRR). Subsequently, the RAs are assessed using four criteria:
quantifiability, threats to validity, missing links, and black box
compatibility, highlighting potential benefits, inherent limitations, and
identifying key areas for further research. Our evaluation reveals that, while
several approaches offer potential, none are free from missing links or other
substantial shortcomings. Moreover, no identified alternative can fully replace
FOT, reflecting its crucial role in the safety validation of ADAS and ADS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统视觉或模型依赖方法在密集、遮挡严重的农业环境中导航失败的问题，需在不损坏枝叶的情况下物理交互。

Result: 在35次试验中，控制器成功到达目标且未损坏任何枝叶，优于现有无模型控制器。

Conclusion: 为密集、接触丰富的可变形环境中的安全自适应交互奠定了基础，支持未来农业任务如修剪和收获。

Abstract: Robotic navigation in dense, cluttered environments such as agricultural
canopies presents significant challenges due to physical and visual occlusion
caused by leaves and branches. Traditional vision-based or model-dependent
approaches often fail in these settings, where physical interaction without
damaging foliage and branches is necessary to reach a target. We present a
novel reactive controller that enables safe navigation for a robotic arm in a
contact-rich, cluttered, deformable environment using end-effector position and
real-time tactile feedback. Our proposed framework's interaction strategy is
based on a trade-off between minimizing disturbance by maneuvering around
obstacles and pushing through them to move towards the target. We show that
over 35 trials in 3 experimental plant setups with an occluded target, the
proposed controller successfully reached the target in all trials without
breaking any branch and outperformed the state-of-the-art model-free controller
in robustness and adaptability. This work lays the foundation for safe,
adaptive interaction in cluttered, contact-rich deformable environments,
enabling future agricultural tasks such as pruning and harvesting in plant
canopies.

Conclusion: 研究为未来群体对话设计提供了方向，强调了多模态策略的重要性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of a group-adaptive conversation design in
two socially interactive agents (SIAs) through two real-world studies. Both
SIAs - Furhat, a social robot, and MetaHuman, a virtual agent - were equipped
with a conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) backend combining hybrid
retrieval and generative models. The studies were carried out in an in-the-wild
setting with a total of $N = 188$ participants who interacted with the SIAs -
in dyads, triads or larger groups - at a German museum. Although the results
did not reveal a significant effect of the group-sensitive conversation design
on perceived satisfaction, the findings provide valuable insights into the
challenges of adapting CAI for multi-party interactions and across different
embodiments (robot vs.\ virtual agent), highlighting the need for multimodal
strategies beyond linguistic pluralization. These insights contribute to the
fields of Human-Agent Interaction (HAI), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and
broader Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), providing insights for future research
on effective dialogue adaptation in group settings.

Abstract: Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world
is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The
diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets
are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI.
However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on
traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which
suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations
significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present
EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It
enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and
photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale
in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can
be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained
physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation.
EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key
modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object
Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates
diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging

### [16] [An $O(n$)-Algorithm for the Higher-Order Kinematics and Inverse Dynamics of Serial Manipulators using Spatial Representation of Twists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10686)
*Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于空间表示的二阶逆动力学算法，并搭配四阶正逆运动学算法，用于机器人臂的优化控制，特别是基于平坦性的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人臂的优化控制需要高效计算关节力矩/力的时间导数，现有递归算法虽高效但需更紧凑的表述。

Method: 采用空间表示法，结合Lie群表述，利用体固定和混合表示的扭转和力矩，提出二阶逆动力学和四阶正逆运动学算法。

Result: 方法在7自由度Franka Emika Panda机器人上验证，展示了其高效性和紧凑性。

Conclusion: 基于Lie群的表述能以向量化参数实现高效计算，适用于机器人臂的实时控制。

Abstract: Optimal control in general, and flatness-based control in particular, of
robotic arms necessitate to compute the first and second time derivatives of
the joint torques/forces required to achieve a desired motion. In view of the
required computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to
this end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation
was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of
twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the
spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is
accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An
advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in
terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is
demonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.

TL;DR: VLFly框架通过整合LLM和VLM，实现了无人机在语言引导下的连续速度控制，解决了VLN中的泛化问题和离散动作空间依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言导航（VLN）中泛化能力不足和依赖固定离散动作空间的问题。

Method: VLFly结合LLM指令编码器、VLM目标检索器和路径规划器，仅需单目摄像头输入，输出连续速度指令。

Result: 在多样化仿真和真实环境中，VLFly无需微调即超越基线，展现出鲁棒的开放词汇目标理解和泛化导航能力。

Conclusion: VLFly为无人机语言导航提供了高效解决方案，适用于复杂环境和抽象语言输入。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

TL;DR: 结合视觉与触觉信息提升机器人手内物体位姿估计精度，解决视觉遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉遮挡是视觉位姿估计的主要挑战，需结合触觉信息提高准确性。

Method: 融合手腕RGB-D摄像头与指尖触觉传感器的数据，使用加权点云的改进ICP算法。

Result: 平均位姿误差7.5毫米和16.7度，比纯视觉方法提升20%。

Conclusion: 多模态融合显著提升遮挡情况下的位姿估计精度，适用于实际操作任务。

Abstract: Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation,
but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches.
This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation,
combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position
and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge
of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D
camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on
the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and
sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types
and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use
an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point
clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating
tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy,
particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose
estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only
baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to
perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.

Motivation: 现有语言条件操纵任务假设指令与环境完美对齐，限制了实际场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含14,000多样本的数据集，提出RationalVLA模型，结合视觉语言模型与操纵策略，通过可学习潜在空间嵌入实现指令推理与拒绝。

Result: RationalVLA在RAMA上成功率提升14.5%，任务长度平均缩短0.94，同时在标准任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: RationalVLA在实际应用中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为机器人语言指令处理提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to
understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing
language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are
perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and
generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous,
irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional
MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen
executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we
construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective
instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,
safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational
Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic
arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level
manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This
design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible
commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that
RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher
success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive
performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate
its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于不变扩展卡尔曼滤波器（InEKF）的框架，用于整合部分方向测量，以提高自主水面舰艇（ASV）在开放海洋环境中的状态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主水面舰艇（ASV）在海洋科学中日益重要，但精确的状态估计（尤其是姿态）对海底测绘至关重要。传统方法依赖固定地标的相对位置测量，而开放海洋中的ASV主要观测后退的地平线。

Method: 利用前向单目相机估计地平线相关的滚转和俯仰角，结合双天线GPS航向测量，提出了一种新颖的InEKF框架，以整合部分方向数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在开放海洋环境中对ASV状态估计具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的部分方向测量方法在开放海洋环境中显著提升了ASV状态估计的精度，优于传统InEKF和MEKF方法。

Abstract: Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) are increasingly vital for marine science,
offering robust platforms for underwater mapping and inspection. Accurate state
estimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor
mapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences
when sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an
Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate
partial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on
relative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily
observe a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to
estimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides
yaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these
measurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating
such partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF
implementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly
relevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a "seafaring plane." This
paper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based
roll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state
estimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full
orientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF). Our results demonstrate the
efficacy and robustness of the proposed partial orientation measurements for
accurate ASV state estimation in open ocean environments.

Motivation: 研究机器人运动与颗粒地形交互的基本原理，为复杂地形中的机器人导航提供高效建模工具。

Method: 集成降维（ST-HOSVD）、代理建模（高斯过程）和数据同化（降阶粒子滤波）技术，基于离线高保真模拟和稀疏实验数据。

Result: 计算时间大幅减少，预测精度接近模拟；结合实验数据时，长期预测优于高保真模拟。

Conclusion: 该方法在机器人导航和未知地形探索中具有潜力，支持在线和离线应用。

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Motivation: 随着自主系统效率与可靠性提升，研究其在机器人辅助交付任务中如何影响人类信任。

Method: 使用输入-输出隐马尔可夫模型（IOHMM）建模人类行为，分析信任动态与行为概率。

Result: 高信任时人类更倾向自主部署机器人；长解释修复信任最有效，否认防止信任流失最佳。

Conclusion: 模型信任估计与自报告值一致，为实时调整人类对自主系统信任的政策奠定基础。

Abstract: With increasing efficiency and reliability, autonomous systems are becoming
valuable assistants to humans in various tasks. In the context of
robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair
strategies impact human trust. In this task, while handling a secondary task,
humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually
control it. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long
explanations, apology and promise, and denial.
  Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an
Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and
human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely
to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state
transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at
repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at
preventing trust loss.
  We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are
isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model
lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time
adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems.

Abstract: We introduce Vib2Move, a novel approach for in-hand object reconfiguration

vibration-based actuator that dynamically modulates the effective finger-object
friction coefficient, effectively emulating changes in gripping force. Second,
we derive a sliding motion model for objects clamped in a parallel gripper with
two symmetric, variable-friction contact patches. Third, we propose a motion
planner that coordinates end-effector finger trajectories and fingertip
vibrations to achieve the desired object pose. In real-world trials, Vib2Move
consistently yields final positioning errors below 6 mm, demonstrating
reliable, high-precision manipulation across a variety of planar objects. For

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仿真平台在策略泛化和指令适应性方面不足，无法满足对基础模型（如LLMs）的公平比较需求。

Method: 开发了GenManip平台，利用LLM驱动的场景图生成多样化任务，并建立GenManip-Bench基准测试。

Result: 模块化系统结合基础模型在多样化场景中表现更优，而端到端策略则受益于数据扩展。

Conclusion: GenManip平台有望为现实条件下的策略泛化研究提供重要支持。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in real-world settings remains challenging, especially
regarding robust generalization. Existing simulation platforms lack sufficient
support for exploring how policies adapt to varied instructions and scenarios.
Thus, they lag behind the growing interest in instruction-following foundation
models like LLMs, whose adaptability is crucial yet remains underexplored in
fair comparisons. To bridge this gap, we introduce GenManip, a realistic
tabletop simulation platform tailored for policy generalization studies. It
features an automatic pipeline via LLM-driven task-oriented scene graph to
synthesize large-scale, diverse tasks using 10K annotated 3D object assets. To
systematically assess generalization, we present GenManip-Bench, a benchmark of
200 scenarios refined via human-in-the-loop corrections. We evaluate two policy
types: (1) modular manipulation systems integrating foundation models for
perception, reasoning, and planning, and (2) end-to-end policies trained
through scalable data collection. Results show that while data scaling benefits
end-to-end methods, modular systems enhanced with foundation models generalize
more effectively across diverse scenarios. We anticipate this platform to
facilitate critical insights for advancing policy generalization in realistic
conditions. Project Page: https://genmanip.axi404.top/.

Result: EyeRobot在五个全景工作空间任务中表现出有效的手眼协调能力，提高了操作效率。

Conclusion: EyeRobot通过仿人眼注视策略，实现了大工作空间下的高效操作。

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

Motivation: 当前视频编辑方法依赖大规模预训练，缺乏灵活性，且首帧引导编辑对后续帧控制不足。

Method: 采用掩码驱动的LoRA调优策略，结合输入视频和参考图像，动态调节模型注意力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频编辑性能上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效、灵活的视频编辑，同时保持了背景区域的稳定性。

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统视觉主干网络的特征构建方式单一，缺乏自适应迭代细化路径，能否通过算法搜索原则实现更结构化、逻辑化的处理流程？

Method: DeepTraverse包含递归探索模块（深化特征分析）和自适应校准模块（动态调整特征显著性），通过算法交互智能构建特征。

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试中，DeepTraverse表现出色，分类准确率和特征区分度优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 集成算法先验为构建更高效、性能更强的结构化视觉主干提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

Motivation: 现有的VLA模型（尤其是基于扩散架构的）因计算和内存需求过高而受限，现有加速方法未能全面解决其瓶颈问题。

Method: EfficientVLA整合了三种策略：语言模块的层剪枝、视觉处理路径的优化以及扩散动作头的中间特征缓存。

Conclusion: EfficientVLA通过系统性冗余消除，显著提升了VLA模型的实用性和部署效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

Motivation: 现有数据集和基准在多模态环境下检测未成年人内容方面存在空白，需要更丰富的数据集以支持相关工具的开发。

Conclusion: ICCWD数据集有助于设计更优的未成年人检测方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Conclusion: RoCA在多种跨域场景中表现出色，为端到端自动驾驶的跨域部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

Conclusion: DanceChat通过LLM的显式指导解决了音乐到舞蹈生成的多样性和对齐问题，表现优于现有技术。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: SPARKE是一种高效且可扩展的提示感知多样性引导方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

Motivation: 传统方法依赖月度统计近似背景反射率，在山区因雪盖动态变化而失效。需要一种能自动学习地表反射率动态的方法。

Method: 基于时空视觉变换器的注意力模拟器，无需手工特征（如反照率图或云掩膜），输入多光谱卫星图像、地形特征和太阳几何数据，训练目标是HelioMont算法的SSR估计。

Result: 模型在提供足够长的时间上下文时，性能与基于反照率的模型相当，尤其在山区表现突出，提升了复杂地形下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效学习地表反射率动态，特别适用于山区和动态雪盖区域，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Motivation: 由于线性探测（LP）无法充分反映掩码图像建模（MIM）模型的潜力，且现有注意力探测方法存在参数过多和计算效率低的问题，因此需要一种更高效的探测方法。

Method: 作者提出了高效探测（EP），采用多查询交叉注意力机制，消除冗余投影，减少可训练参数，并显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 高效探测（EP）是一种简单但强大的方法，显著提升了注意力探测的效率和性能，适用于多种预训练范式。

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

Conclusion: 低秩适应和参数加法策略有效平衡了个人概念学习与通用知识保留，实现了最先进的个性化检索性能。

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

Conclusion: ScoreMix无需大量参数搜索即可显著提升性能，为训练判别模型提供实用优势，同时缓解大数据集收集问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到65.31 NDS和57.4 mAP，验证集上56.2 NDS和46.2 mAP，实时推理速度33 FPS。

Conclusion: DySS在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于自动驾驶感知任务。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

Conclusion: HalLoc为视觉语言模型的可靠性提供了新工具，推动了实际应用中的信任度提升。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and

*Sadia Kamal,Tim Oates,Joy Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督多模态框架，用于从有限输入生成临床结构化SOAP笔记，减轻医生负担并减少对大量标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且导致医生疲劳，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入MedConceptEval和CCS两个新指标评估临床质量。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展且临床实用，显著减轻医生负担并减少标注数据需求。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Motivation: 随着元宇宙的兴起，全向视频（ODV）逐渐从专业生成内容（PGC）转向用户生成内容（UGC），但音视频质量评估（AVQA）的研究仍有限。

Method: 构建了一个包含300个视频的UGC ODV数据集，通过主观实验获取平均意见分数（MOS），并设计了一个包含视频特征提取、音频特征提取和音视频融合模块的基线模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，基线模型在提出的数据集上表现最优。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了UGC ODV音视频质量评估的空白，为后续研究提供了数据集和基线模型。

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

### [47] [Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334)
*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本提示下分析学生学术情绪的能力，发现Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct表现优于Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct，尤其在识别快乐和困惑情绪方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法在跨场景泛化能力上不足，需要反复数据收集和训练，VLMs提供了一种无需微调的替代方案。

Method: 使用两种VLMs（Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct）对5000张学生面部表情图像进行零样本分析。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct表现更优，尤其在快乐和困惑情绪识别上，但两者均无法有效识别分心行为。

Conclusion: VLMs在学术情绪分析中具有潜力，尤其是Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct在识别学生困惑情绪方面表现突出。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于点特征感知的高斯泼溅框架，解决了3DGS在稀疏视图输入下的过拟合问题，实现了实时高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法需要大量校准视图，稀疏输入时易过拟合，导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 使用立体基础模型估计相机位姿并重建密集点云；通过多尺度2D特征采样和自注意力网络增强点间交互；轻量MLP解码高斯参数。

Result: 在多样基准测试中显著优于NeRF方法，在少样本设置下与最先进3DGS方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了稀疏视图下的3DGS渲染质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

TL;DR: GeoCAD是一种用户友好的局部几何可控CAD生成方法，通过互补标注策略生成几何指令，利用LLM预测局部部分，提升生成质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时满足遵循文本指令和专注于局部部分的需求，因此提出GeoCAD以解决这一局限性。

Method: 采用互补标注策略（顶点和VLLM标注）生成几何指令，训练时随机掩码局部部分，利用LLM预测；推理时用户可指定局部修改。

Result: 实验证明GeoCAD在生成质量、有效性和文本-CAD一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoCAD成功实现了局部几何可控的CAD生成，代码将开源。

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的多模态研究框架，用于自动化和规模化分析城市街景风格差异，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市文化和建筑风格因地理、历史和社会政治因素而异，传统研究方法难以标准化，需要更客观和数据驱动的方法。

Method: 构建UrbanDiffBench数据集，开发UrbanSense框架，利用视觉语言模型定量生成和比较城市风格表示。

Result: 超过80%的描述通过t检验，主观评价显示高Phi分数（城市0.912，时期0.833），表明方法能捕捉细微风格差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为量化城市风格演变提供了科学依据，对未来设计具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

TL;DR: RealKeyMorph (RKM) 是一种分辨率无关的医学图像配准方法，通过提取真实世界坐标中的关键点，避免重采样带来的伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习配准方法需将图像重采样至固定分辨率，可能引入插值伪影，RKM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RKM扩展了KeyMorph框架，利用扫描仪的仿射矩阵将关键点映射到真实世界坐标，实现分辨率无关的配准。

Result: 实验证明RKM在腹部MRI和不同分辨率脑数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: RKM通过避免重采样，提供了一种更优的医学图像配准解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语义对齐和运动合成上依赖端到端映射策略，导致生成的运动缺乏可控性、一致性和多样性。

Method: 提出Motion-R1框架，结合Chain-of-Thought机制分解文本指令，并使用Group Relative Policy Optimization算法联合优化推理链和运动合成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，Motion-R1表现优于现有方法，尤其在语义理解和长期时间一致性方面。

Conclusion: Motion-R1通过结构化推理显著提升了运动生成的质量，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight models. MHLA notably
improves inference speed, allowing FaceLiVT to deliver high accuracy with lower
latency on mobile devices. Specifically, FaceLiVT is 8.6 faster than EdgeFace,
a recent hybrid CNN-Transformer model optimized for edge devices, and 21.2
faster than a pure ViT-Based model. With its balanced design, FaceLiVT offers
an efficient and practical solution for real-time face recognition on

Conclusion: FSATFusion通过创新的注意力机制和Transformer改进，显著提升了IVIF任务的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架为自注意力机制提供了更深入的理论基础，同时展示了其实际性能改进的潜力。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了海底埋藏的非侵入式、可扩展测绘，为污染场地的环境评估提供了支持。

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

Result: DART在DeiT（ImageNet-1K）上提升2.1%准确率，同时减少45% FLOPs。

Conclusion: DART在多种模型上一致提升性能，计算开销低，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

Conclusion: ReconMOST框架在全局多层海洋温度重建中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为海洋气象研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

Motivation: 统一模型在图像理解和生成任务中表现不佳，主要因视觉特征和训练过程的差异。

Result: 在20多个图像理解基准和GenEval生成基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: Pisces展示了图像理解与生成的协同关系，推动了统一多模态模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

TL;DR: LRRNet是一种新型的红外小目标检测框架，通过低秩背景建模提升检测性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在复杂背景下因低信噪比和目标形态多样而困难，现有深度学习方法性能不稳定。

Method: 采用压缩-重建-减法（CRS）范式，直接学习低秩背景表示，无需分块处理或显式矩阵分解。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于38种现有方法，检测精度、鲁棒性和计算效率均优，实时性能达82.34 FPS。

Conclusion: LRRNet首次通过端到端深度学习直接建模低秩背景，显著提升红外小目标检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: MF2Summ是一种基于多模态内容理解的视频摘要模型，结合视觉和听觉信息，通过五阶段流程实现，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频内容的快速增长需要有效的视频摘要技术，传统单模态方法难以捕捉视频的全部语义信息。

Method: MF2Summ采用五阶段流程：特征提取、跨模态注意力交互、特征融合、片段预测和关键镜头选择，使用Transformer建模模态间依赖关系。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上，MF2Summ的F1分数分别比DSNet提高了1.9%和0.6%，优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: MF2Summ通过多模态融合显著提升了视频摘要的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在同时处理模态缺失和分布外数据时效果不佳，且参数过多，CIDer旨在解决这些问题。

Method: CIDer包含自蒸馏模块（MSSD）和因果推理模块（MACI），分别增强模态缺失鲁棒性和分布外泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明CIDer在模态缺失和分布外场景下表现优异，参数更少且训练更快。

Conclusion: CIDer为多模态情感识别提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显式运动引导方法在人体视频压缩中因复杂多样的运动模式导致重建结果失真和运动不准确，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出隐式运动变换（IMT），将复杂人体信号转化为紧凑视觉特征，并转换为隐式运动引导以重建信号。

Result: 实验证明IMT方法能有效提升生成式人体视频编解码器（GHVC）的压缩效率和重建保真度。

Conclusion: IMT方法为人体视频压缩提供了一种高效且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种增强高光谱图像（HSI）分类模型对抗样本可迁移性的新方法，通过随机分块和特征距离损失设计，显著提升了对抗样本在黑盒模型中的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）因其高维和丰富的光谱信息，与自然图像不同，现有对抗攻击方法在HSI上的研究有限，且难以充分利用图像的结构和特征信息。

Method: 1. 在保持图像结构不变的情况下，随机将图像在空间和光谱维度分块，并应用多种变换以增加输入多样性；2. 设计针对中间层的特征距离损失，结合输出层预测作为辅助损失，引导扰动破坏真实类别的特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的对抗样本在两个公开HSI数据集上对黑盒模型具有显著的可迁移性，且在防御策略下仍保持强攻击性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了HSI对抗样本的可迁移性和攻击鲁棒性，为HSI分类模型的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度神经网络（DNN）量化中权重初始化对量化鲁棒性的影响，并提出了一种基于图超网络（GHN）的新方法GHN-QAT，显著提升了量化模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是降低机器学习模型推理成本的重要工具，但现有研究很少关注权重初始化对量化鲁棒性的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析不同权重初始化方法对CNN量化鲁棒性的影响，提出使用GHN预测量化DNN参数的方法（GHN-QAT），并进一步微调以提升量化准确性。

Result: 实验表明，GHN-QAT显著提升了4位量化的准确性，并在2位量化中表现优于随机初始化。

Conclusion: GHN-QAT为量化DNN模型设计提供了新思路，未来可结合量化感知训练进一步优化量化流程。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Conclusion: MedSeg-R为医学图像推理分割提供了有效解决方案，并引入大规模数据集MedSeg-QA支持未来研究。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了四种视觉语言模型（VLM）在零样本设置下对三类深度伪造（换脸、重演和合成生成）的检测能力，发现其虽能提供合理解释但尚不可靠，但可作为辅助工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术日益复杂，威胁媒体完整性和公众信任，而视觉语言模型（VLMs）因其潜力成为检测工具而受到关注。

Method: 研究对ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini和Grok四种VLM进行零样本评估，使用真实与伪造图像组成的基准测试其分类准确性和推理深度。

Result: VLMs能生成合理解释并检测表面异常，但作为独立检测系统不可靠，易受风格元素和误导性视觉模式影响。

Conclusion: VLMs在可解释性和上下文分析方面有优势，适合作为混合或人机协作检测框架的组成部分，但尚无法独立胜任深度伪造检测。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music

textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文研究了蜂蜜的植物来源区分技术，提出了一种结合持续反向传播（CB）算法的类增量学习（CIL）方法，以提高区分性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜂蜜的植物来源影响其风味和健康价值，但难以一次性收集所有品种训练模型，因此需要类增量学习技术。

Method: 研究比较了多种CIL算法，并提出结合CB算法的方法，通过重新初始化较少使用的隐藏神经元来提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，CB方法将大多数CIL算法的性能提高了1-7%。

Conclusion: CB方法有效解决了类增量学习中的可塑性损失问题，提升了蜂蜜植物来源区分的准确性。

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

Motivation: 当前RRSIS方法依赖多模态融合主干和语义分割头，面临密集标注需求和复杂场景解释的挑战。

Method: 将任务分解为粗定位和精细分割两阶段：粗定位阶段通过视觉定位网络大致定位目标；精细分割阶段利用SAM模型，结合聚类前景点生成器和掩码边界迭代优化策略。

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM通过两阶段分解和训练自由设计，有效解决了RRSIS任务中的挑战，并提供了高质量标注数据集。

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by

localization mechanisms to accurately identify and differentiate between real
and fake damages, as well as segment individual car parts. The model is trained
on a large-scale, richly annotated automotive dataset that categorizes damage
into 26 types, identifies 7 fake damage variants, and segments 61 distinct car
parts. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in both segmentation
accuracy and damage classification, paving the way for intelligent automotive
inspection and assessment applications.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for
understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing
ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

Result: 实验表明，CEI在检测细微偏差方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CEI为评估人脸识别系统的公平性提供了强大且敏感的工具，方法也适用于其他统计分布尾部分析问题。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for
large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene
representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and
memory requirements. ESLAM introduced a plane-based tensor decomposition but
still struggled with memory growth. Addressing these challenges, we propose a

decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency, and
reconstruction/localization quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches.
Evaluation across diverse indoor RGB-D datasets demonstrates LRSLAM's superior
performance in terms of parameter efficiency, processing time, and accuracy,

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均性能提升3.47%。

Conclusion: T2I-PAL有效减少模态差距，提升识别性能，且无需全标注图像。

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HyperSphereDiff通过方向噪声保留超球面几何，显著提升了生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

Conclusion: 非对称随机掩码策略在自蒸馏框架中有效，能保留关键信息并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

Conclusion: HEA-MM框架能有效评估飞机CAD模型的制造误差，提升质量控制水平。

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Conclusion: SSP通过统一框架显著提升了点监督下密集场景的检测性能，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

Conclusion: TexTailor通过改进纹理合成过程，显著提升了纹理一致性和生成质量。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对医学影像的文本到图像潜在扩散模型微调框架，解决了临床信息与影像对齐不足的问题，并在标准数据集上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像领域缺乏数据导致文本到图像的潜在扩散模型研究不足，且现有模型未能有效对齐临床文本与影像信息。

Method: 通过微调预训练模型，改进多模态对齐，使其适用于下游任务（如短语定位）。

Result: 在MS-CXR数据集上达到新SOTA，并在VinDr-CXR数据上表现稳健。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了医学影像与文本的对齐能力，为下游任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: SymmFlow是一种对称流匹配框架，统一了语义分割、分类和图像生成任务，通过双向一致性学习和保留语义信息，实现了高效采样和多样化生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在图像生成和语义任务之间存在分离，且需要严格的映射关系。SymmFlow旨在统一这些任务，并支持灵活的像素级和图像级条件输入。

Method: 采用对称学习目标，联合建模正向和反向变换，确保双向一致性；引入新训练目标以保留语义信息，支持一步分割和分类。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如CelebAMask-HQ（FID 11.9）和COCO-Stuff（FID 7.0），并在语义分割和分类任务中展现竞争力。

Conclusion: SymmFlow为多任务生成模型提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有微调方法依赖人工标注和大量计算资源，限制了实用性。

Method: 设计提示驱动的数据引擎和奖励引导的训练策略，利用预训练视觉语言模型反馈优化样本权重。

Result: 在VBench-2.0基准测试中，平均性能提升约4%，仅需4 GPU小时。

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1高效且有效，无需人工标注和大量真实数据。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有原型方法在医学图像中可视化不一致和原型过于细粒度的问题，提升病灶范围和生物标志物的可解释性。

Method: 利用ViT捕捉长距离依赖关系，结合对比学习和多分辨率输入处理，学习可解释的原型。

Result: 在视网膜OCT图像分类任务中表现优异，原型具有临床相关性，提供更有意义的解释。

Conclusion: PiPViT能够透明地解释决策，辅助临床医生理解诊断结果。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Motivation: 深度伪造技术威胁信息真实性，现有检测模型资源消耗大。

Result: 在Style GAN数据集上准确率94.14%，AUC-ROC得分0.985。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源环境下的深度伪造检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UAC的新框架，通过文本提示生成高保真对抗样本，提升CAPTCHA多样性，并支持定向和非定向攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAPTCHA方案在深度学习攻击下日益脆弱，现有对抗攻击方法依赖原始图像特征，导致失真且适用性受限。

Method: UAC利用大型语言模型生成对抗样本，针对定向攻击采用EDICT方法优化扩散模型，非定向攻击则引入BP-UAC策略。

Result: 实验表明BP-UAC在多种系统中攻击成功率高，生成的CAPTCHA对人类和DNN均难以区分。

Conclusion: UAC框架有效解决了传统CAPTCHA的脆弱性问题，为对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决未成年人在公开数据中代表性不足及分布偏移问题，提升自动筛查的准确性。

Method: 使用冻结的FaRL视觉语言主干网络，结合多任务MLP，引入α加权焦点损失和年龄平衡采样策略。

Result: 在ASORES-39k测试集上，RMSE从5.733降至5.656，F2分数从0.801提升至0.857；在ASWIFT-20k测试集上，召回率接近0.99，F2分数从0.742提升至0.833。

Conclusion: 多任务架构和改进的损失函数显著提升了模型在未成年检测任务中的性能，尤其在分布偏移下表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

Motivation: 现实应用（如机器人和自动驾驶）需要模型同时处理实例和类别的学习，而传统持续学习仅关注单一层次。

Method: 提出HyperCLIC算法，利用双曲空间的低失真和紧凑嵌入特性，结合双曲分类和蒸馏目标，建模层次关系。

Result: 在EgoObjects数据集上验证，HyperCLIC在多粒度任务中表现优异，提升了层次泛化能力。

Conclusion: HyperCLIC通过双曲空间有效解决了实例和类别的持续学习问题，适用于动态现实场景。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Motivation: 现有COD方法在目标与背景视觉差异细微的情况下仍有优化空间，尤其是后处理环节尚未充分探索。

Result: 在多个COD基准测试中表现优异，平均MAE提升5.5%，加权F-measure提升3.2%，且计算开销较小。

Conclusion: UMBD框架能无缝集成现有COD模型，结合判别与生成优势，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Conclusion: 该方法在表面缺陷检测中具有实际应用价值，可提升效率。

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Result: 在六个医学数据集上，IQE-CLIP在零样本和少样本设置中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP通过多模态信息融合，显著提升了医学异常检测的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

Result: 实验证明SbCA在超大规模放大任务（如×100）中显著优于现有方法，生成高质量图像。

Conclusion: SbCA有效解决了分布漂移问题，消除了伪影和模糊，适用于超大规模图像超分辨率任务。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合事件相机与强化学习的机器人导航控制器，实现实时人中心导航与避障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像控制器存在固定速率、运动模糊和延迟问题，事件相机的异步特性可解决这些问题。

Method: 整合事件感知、范围传感和DDPG策略优化，加入模仿学习提高样本效率。

Result: 在模拟环境中实现稳健导航、行人跟随和避障。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了事件相机在机器人导航中的潜力。

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional
image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion
blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated
environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and
obstacle avoidance. A demo video is available at the project website.

*Mario Barbara,Alaa Maalouf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种零样本、基于文本查询的视频摘要方法，无需训练数据，通过结合视频语言模型和大语言模型，实现了用户可控的视频摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据的爆炸式增长需要灵活的用户可控摘要工具，而现有方法依赖数据集或无法结合用户自然语言意图。

Method: 方法包括视频分段、场景描述生成、大语言模型评分及重要性分数传播，提出一致性和独特性两个新指标。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum上超越所有无监督方法，在QFVS基准上表现竞争力，无需训练数据。

Conclusion: 研究表明，预训练多模态模型结合提示和分数传播，为通用文本查询视频摘要提供了强大基础。

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督图像配准方法在稀疏特征和大位移场景下表现不佳，SmoothProper旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入对偶优化层和定制交互项，强制平滑性和消息传递，无需超参数调优。

Result: 在视网膜血管数据集上，配准误差降至1.88像素，首次有效解决两大挑战。

Conclusion: SmoothPrope是一种高效、通用的无监督配准方法，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码自编码器的遮挡感知手-物体姿态估计方法（HOMAE），通过目标聚焦掩码策略和多尺度特征融合，显著提升了遮挡情况下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在遮挡严重的手-物体交互中表现不佳，主要因为缺乏全局结构感知和推理能力。

Method: 采用目标聚焦掩码策略，结合多尺度特征预测有符号距离场（SDF），并融合显式点云以增强几何感知。

Result: 在DexYCB和HO3Dv2基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HOMAE通过结合全局和局部几何信息，有效解决了遮挡问题，提升了姿态估计的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoDeepResearch是一种基于文本推理模型和多模态工具包的代理框架，无需依赖多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）即可显著提升长视频理解（LVU）任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长视频理解任务中面临复杂性和上下文窗口限制的挑战，研究旨在验证是否可以通过文本推理模型和工具包替代MLLMs。

Method: 提出VideoDeepResearch框架，结合文本推理模型（LRM）和模块化多模态工具包（如多模态检索器和视觉感知器），通过推理制定策略并选择性利用视频内容。

Result: 在MLVU、Video-MME和LVBench等基准测试中，性能分别提升9.6%、6.6%和3.9%，超越现有MLLM基线。

Conclusion: 代理系统在解决长视频理解任务中具有潜力，无需依赖复杂的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专为视频抠图设计的后训练量化（PTQ）框架，通过两阶段策略、全局仿射校准和光流辅助组件，显著提升了量化模型的精度和时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频抠图在资源受限设备上部署时面临计算量大和量化后精度下降的问题，现有PTQ方法尚未系统解决。

Method: 提出两阶段PTQ策略（块重建优化和全局校准）、统计驱动的全局仿射校准（GAC）方法，以及光流辅助（OFA）组件。

Result: PTQ4VM在低比特量化下接近全精度性能，4-bit量化下误差降低20%，计算量减少8倍。

Conclusion: 该框架为视频抠图量化提供了首个系统解决方案，显著提升了效率和精度。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Result: 评估了12个LLM和16个VLM，提供了多步推理领域的深入分析。

Conclusion: VRBench为多步推理领域提供了有价值的基准和见解。

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI工具在图形设计中难以准确整合用户资产、保持可编辑性和专业视觉吸引力，商业系统依赖模板库不实用。

Method: 使用协议模型生成JSON规范，描述每层布局、内容和样式，再通过条件背景模型合成背景。

Result: CreatiPoster在图形设计生成基准测试中优于开源和商业系统，并发布了10万份无版权设计库。

Conclusion: CreatiPoster推动了AI辅助图形设计的民主化，支持多种应用场景。

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种零样本生成模型适应方法（ZSGM），通过分析CLIP嵌入空间中文本偏移与图像偏移的不对齐问题，提出了一种迭代优化的新方法AIR，显著提升了生成图像的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ZSGM方法假设图像偏移与文本偏移在CLIP嵌入空间中完全对齐，导致生成图像质量下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过实证研究分析CLIP嵌入空间中的偏移不对齐现象，并提出迭代优化方法AIR。

Result: 在26种实验设置中，AIR方法在定性和定量评估中均达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: AIR方法通过关注偏移不对齐问题，显著提升了零样本生成模型适应中的图像质量。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Motivation: 解决传统Transformer在文本到视频生成中计算复杂度高的问题，并扩展Mamba架构在多模态任务中的适用性。

Method: 设计了多模态扩散Mamba块（MM-DiM），通过多模态令牌重组实现高效的多模态信息整合和时空建模。

Result: M4V在768×1280分辨率下生成视频时，FLOPs减少了45%，并通过奖励学习策略提升了视频质量。

Conclusion: M4V在降低计算成本的同时，能够生成高质量视频，为文本到视频生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.
Code and models will be publicly available at

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的视频标注方法，设计块因果扩散变换器，训练于三个代理任务：下一图像预测、当前分割预测和下一分割预测。

Result: 模型在上下文图像编辑任务中表现优异，并在多轮图像编辑基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 尽管仅用视频训练，模型在多概念组合、故事生成和编辑链应用中展现出潜力。

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视觉生成方法将图像视为空间块，这与自回归建模的因果性相矛盾。为了解决这一问题，论文提出从频谱角度实现视觉序列的因果性。

Method: 提出SpectralAR框架，首先通过嵌套频谱标记化将图像转换为有序频谱标记（从低频到高频），然后以粗到细的方式自回归生成频谱标记序列。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，SpectralAR仅用64个标记和310M参数就达到了3.02 gFID。

Conclusion: SpectralAR通过频谱视角实现了视觉序列的因果性和标记效率，为自回归视觉生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Conclusion: MMMG揭示了图像生成模型的推理缺陷，FLUX-Reason为未来研究提供了有效基线。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型中视觉令牌冗余导致的高推理成本问题，现有方法存在重复令牌或忽略指令相关性的缺陷。

Method: 提出基于条件多样性的剪枝方法CDPruner，利用条件相似性和行列式点过程（DPP）优化令牌选择。

Conclusion: CDPruner通过最大化条件多样性，高效剪枝冗余令牌，适用于多种MLLM，显著提升效率且性能损失极小。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频技术威胁信息可信度，现有检测器缺乏高质量真实数据集。

Method: 构建GenWorld数据集（真实模拟、高质量、多样化），提出SpannDetector模型利用多视角一致性检测。

Result: 实验显示SpannDetector优于现有方法，为可解释检测提供新方向。

Conclusion: GenWorld和SpannDetector推动AI生成视频检测领域发展。

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，QuadricFormer实现了最优性能，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: 超二次曲面基元能够高效建模复杂几何结构，QuadricFormer为3D占用预测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 现有注意力扰动方法缺乏确定扰动位置的原则性方法，尤其是在DiT架构中，质量相关计算分布在多层中。

Method: 研究注意力扰动的粒度（从层到单个注意力头），提出HeadHunter框架迭代选择注意力头，并引入SoftPAG线性插值方法调节扰动强度。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX.1等模型上验证，展示了在生成质量提升和风格特定引导方面的优越性能。

Conclusion: 首次在扩散模型中实现头级注意力扰动分析，揭示了注意力层的可解释性分工，为设计有效扰动策略提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Motivation: 现有3D场景修复方法依赖耗时优化，无法满足实时或在线应用需求。

Method: 提出自监督掩码微调策略，训练定制化大型重建模型（LRM），并通过2D修复提案生成3D修复结果。

Result: 在两大基准测试中保持领先性能，并支持灵活的下游应用（如物体插入和多区域修复）。

Conclusion: InstaInpaint在速度和性能上均有显著提升，适用于实时3D场景修复。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

Result: 该方法在多样数据集上展示了生成新视图合成的优越一致性和合理性。

Conclusion: SceneCompleter通过融合结构和纹理信息，实现了视觉连贯且3D一致的生成场景补全。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的新型密度均衡映射框架（LDEM），解决了传统方法在精度、重叠伪影和从2D扩展到3D时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度均衡映射方法存在精度不足、极端情况下产生重叠伪影以及从2D扩展到3D时需重新设计算法的问题。

Method: 采用深度神经网络，设计了一种损失函数以确保密度均匀性和几何规则性，并通过分层方法预测粗粒度和密集级别的变换。

Result: LDEM在密度均衡和双射性方面优于现有方法，并能无缝从2D扩展到3D。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射的稳健计算提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

TL;DR: FastFLUX是一种架构级剪枝框架，通过BRLL方法和ST策略提升FLUX模型的推理效率，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I生成模型（如FLUX）参数庞大，导致推理慢、内存占用高，现有加速方法性能下降明显且训练成本高。

Method: 提出Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) 方法替换复杂残差分支，并结合Sandwich Training (ST) 策略进行局部微调。

Result: FastFLUX在剪枝20%层级后仍保持高质量图像生成，显著提升推理速度。

Conclusion: FastFLUX有效解决了FLUX模型的效率问题，为T2I生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

Motivation: 解决CFG需要特定训练且仅适用于条件生成的限制。

Method: 提出TPG，通过规范保持的扰动矩阵直接作用于扩散网络中的中间令牌表示。

Result: 在SDXL和Stable Diffusion 2.1上，TPG在非条件生成中FID提升近2倍，同时与CFG在提示对齐上表现接近。

Conclusion: TPG是一种通用、条件无关的引导方法，扩展了CFG的优势至更广泛的扩散模型。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
diffusion models to enhance both generation quality and alignment with input
conditions. However, CFG requires specific training procedures and is limited
to conditional generation. To address these limitations, we propose Token
Perturbation Guidance (TPG), a novel method that applies perturbation matrices
directly to intermediate token representations within the diffusion network.
TPG employs a norm-preserving shuffling operation to provide effective and
stable guidance signals that improve generation quality without architectural
changes. As a result, TPG is training-free and agnostic to input conditions,
making it readily applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation.
We further analyze the guidance term provided by TPG and show that its effect
on sampling more closely resembles CFG compared to existing training-free
guidance techniques. Extensive experiments on SDXL and Stable Diffusion 2.1
show that TPG achieves nearly a 2$\times$ improvement in FID for unconditional
generation over the SDXL baseline, while closely matching CFG in prompt
alignment. These results establish TPG as a general, condition-agnostic
guidance method that brings CFG-like benefits to a broader class of diffusion
models. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖高质量数据集，而低质量图像常被丢弃。论文旨在证明这些图像仍有价值，并提出方法利用所有可用图像提升模型性能。

Method: 提出Ambient Diffusion Omni框架，利用图像的光谱幂律衰减和局部性特性，从所有可用图像中提取信号，包括合成损坏的图像。

Result: 成功训练出能处理合成损坏图像的扩散模型，并在ImageNet上实现最佳FID，文本到图像生成的质量和多样性显著提升。

Conclusion: 噪声可缓解高质量分布与混合分布之间的初始偏差，理论分析验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Conclusion: 该方法降低了数据采集门槛，提升了虚拟试衣的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

Result: Edit360能够从任意视角进行用户定制编辑，并确保多视角结构一致性，支持高质量3D资产重建。

Conclusion: Edit360为可定制的3D内容创作提供了灵活且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态校准稀疏惯性运动捕捉系统的新方法，突破了传统IMU校准中绝对静态假设的限制，显著扩展了应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IMU校准方法依赖绝对静态假设（RG'G和RBS矩阵恒定），限制了实际应用场景。本文旨在通过动态校准解决这一问题。

Method: 基于两个宽松假设（短时间窗口内矩阵变化微小，且运动/IMU读数多样化），利用Transformer模型学习RG'G和RBS矩阵的映射关系，并设计校准触发器确保条件满足。

Result: 首次实现隐式IMU校准（无需显式校准过程），并支持稀疏IMU的长期高精度运动捕捉。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统限制，为稀疏IMU系统提供了更灵活、高效的动态校准方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

Abstract: We study diversity in approval-based committee elections with incomplete or
inaccurate information. As standard in the literature on approval-based
multi-winner voting, we define diversity according to the maximum coverage
problem, which is known to be NP-complete, with a best attainable polynomial
time approximation ratio of $1-1/\e$. In the incomplete information model,
voters can vote on only a small portion of the candidates. We suggest a greedy
algorithm and a local search algorithm that query voters and use the query
responses to approximate the total population's opinion. For both algorithms,
we prove an upper bound on the number of queries required to get a close to
$(1-1/\e)$-approximate solution with high probability. We also provide a lower
bound for the query complexity of non-adaptive algorithms, that cannot adapt
their querying strategy to readily obtained information. In the inaccurate
information setting, voters' responses are corrupted with a probability
$p\in(0,\frac{1}{2})$. We provide both an upper and a lower bound for the
number of queries required to attain a $(1-1/\e)$-approximate solution with
high probability. Finally, using real data from Polis, we see that our
algorithms perform remarkably better than the theoretical results suggest, both
with incomplete and inaccurate information.

TL;DR: DANCE^2是一个互动舞蹈表演，观众通过投票控制舞者身上的机器人行为，形成舞者与机器人的二重奏。尽管观众感觉自己的选择影响了表演，但投票数据却显示出高度一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索观众集体行为与个体感知之间的张力，以及这种张力如何反映在算法化的数字系统中。

Method: 通过实时投票系统让观众在表演关键时刻选择继续或改变舞蹈编排，结合问卷调查和投票数据分析。

Result: 观众认为自己的选择有意义，但投票数据表明行为模式高度一致，揭示了行为、感知与权力之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: 表演设计、互动方式和结构调节了观众的行为与感知，为算法化系统中“感受到但未行使”的代理提供了类比。

Abstract: We describe DANCE^2, an interactive dance performance in which audience
members channel their collective agency into a dancer-robot duet by voting on
the behavior of a wearable robot affixed to the dancer's body. At key moments
during the performance, the audience is invited to either continue the
choreography or override it, shaping the unfolding interaction through
real-time collective input. While post-performance surveys revealed that
participants felt their choices meaningfully influenced the performance, voting
data across four public performances exhibited strikingly consistent patterns.
This tension between what audience members do, what they feel, and what
actually changes highlights a complex interplay between agentive behavior, the
experience of agency, and power. We reflect on how choreography, interaction
design, and the structure of the performance mediate this relationship,
offering a live analogy for algorithmically curated digital systems where
agency is felt, but not exercised.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生对平行坐标图（PCPs）等不熟悉的数据可视化技术存在识字困难，需要有效的教学方法。

Method: 采用修订版布鲁姆分类法和掌握学习法在数据可视化课程中进行干预实验，比较两种方法的效果。

Result: 掌握学习组在高级思维模块（分析、评估）表现更好，对PCPs的理解更深入。

Conclusion: 掌握学习法有助于提升学生对复杂可视化技术的理解，研究提供了完整的教学材料和测试工具。

Abstract: Developing literacy with unfamiliar data visualization techniques such as
Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs) can be a significant challenge for students.
We adopted the Revised Bloom's taxonomy to instruct students on Parallel
Coordinate Plots (PCPs) using Mastery Learning in the classroom. To evaluate
Mastery Learning's impact, we conducted an intervention in a Data Visualization
course to teach students about PCPs using the Revised Bloom's taxonomy with and
without Mastery Learning. Based on our intervention, we found that while
students in both groups performed similarly on the first two (Remember,
Understand) modules, the students in the Mastery Learning group performed
better on modules that required more advanced thinking (Analyze, Evaluate) and
demonstrated a better comprehension of PCPs. We provide all the materials
developed including the six-module Bloom's Taxonomy PCP literacy (BTPL) test
for full reproducibility on our website at

*Jeongone Seo,Ryan Womack,Tawfiq Ammari*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了韩国移民家庭如何通过文化价值观和即时需求动态协商AI工具的使用，挑战了传统AI素养模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在家庭生活中的深入应用为移民家庭带来独特的代际、语言和文化挑战，需探索其动态协商过程。

Method: 通过20次半结构化访谈，分析父母和青少年在AI使用中的实践。

Result: 发现两种关键实践：父母的文化伦理中介和青少年的实用主义延迟批判，揭示AI素养为动态关系实践。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了代际AI素养概念，为设计更公平、文化敏感的家庭AI系统提供启示。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes deeply integrated into family life,
immigrant families must navigate unique intergenerational, linguistic, and
cultural challenges. This study examines how Korean immigrant families in the
United States negotiate the use of AI tools such as ChatGPT and smart
assistants in their homes. Through 20 semi-structured interviews with parents
and teens, we identify two key practices that shape their engagement:
interpretive gatekeeping, where parents mediate their children's AI use through
a lens of cultural and ethical values, and convenient critical deferment, where
teens strategically postpone critical evaluation of AI for immediate academic
and social utility. These intertwined practices challenge conventional,
skills-based models of AI literacy, revealing it instead as a dynamic and
relational practice co-constructed through ongoing family negotiation. We
contribute to information science and HCI by offering a new conceptual
extension for intergenerational AI literacy and providing design implications
for more equitable, culturally attuned, and family-centered AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了推测设计在土著人机交互（HCI）中的应用，指出了时间性假设的局限性，并提出了基于“螺旋时间”概念的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推测设计在土著HCI中的适用性，并解决其时间性假设可能带来的问题。

Method: 分析推测设计的现有应用，指出其局限性，并提出基于“螺旋时间”的新理解。

Result: 发现时间性假设可能削弱推测设计的实用性，而“螺旋时间”概念可能更适合土著HCI。

Conclusion: 提出“螺旋时间”作为推测设计的替代框架，以更好地服务于土著HCI的需求。

Abstract: In this position paper, we first discuss the uptake of speculative design as
a method for Indigenous HCI. Then, we outline how a key assumption about
temporality threatens to undermine the usefulness of speculative design in this
context. Finally, we briefly sketch out a possible alternative understanding of
speculative design, based on the concept of "spiraling time," which could be
better suited for Indigenous HCI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI如何有效增强人类创造力，明确其实现路径。

Method: 基于分布式创造力视角，提出三种AI贡献模式（支持、协同、共生），分析其技术自主性和感知代理性维度。

Result: 不同模式对不同层次创造力（日常问题解决到范式创新）有不同影响。

Conclusion: 研究为AI增强创造力的理论、伦理和设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

*Lalitha A R*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出从合规导向的网页无障碍转向以用户自主为中心的关怀驱动模型，以神经多样性用户为例，强调个性化需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无障碍标准常被静态化执行，缺乏灵活性，忽视了用户个性化需求。

Method: 引入可定制的Comfort Mode框架，允许用户调整界面设置（如对比度、字体、动画等），同时保持品牌视觉一致性。

Result: 展示了最小化和高级实现模型，证明低成本下无缝集成包容性设计的可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架为用户提供自主选择权，实现用户自主、美学完整性与无障碍的融合，无需妥协。

Abstract: This paper proposes a shift from compliance-centered web accessibility to a
care-driven model that prioritizes user autonomy, using neurodivergent users as
a catalyst case for broader personalization needs. While accessibility
standards offer a flexible framework, they are often interpreted and
implemented as static compliance checklists, our approach reframes it as a
flexible, user-centered process. We introduce a customizable Comfort Mode
framework that allows users to adapt interface settings, such as contrast,
typography, motion, and scaling, according to their individual needs, while
retaining the brand's core visual identity. Grounded in psychological and
cognitive accessibility principles, our design supports personalization without
sacrificing creative freedom. We present both minimal and advanced
implementation models with mock-ups, demonstrating how inclusive design can be
seamlessly integrated at minimal cost. This approach aims to broaden digital
inclusivity by offering autonomy to those who require it, without imposing
changes on those who do not. The proposed system is adaptable, scalable, and
suitable for a wide range of users and brands, offering a new paradigm where
user autonomy, aesthetic integrity, and accessibility converge not through
compromise, but through choice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化表示设计空间的方法，结合IDEA框架，利用LLMs和MCTS算法提升设计决策效率，并在多个场景中验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计空间依赖设计师经验且缺乏数学形式化，限制了自动化设计支持。

Method: 通过正交维度和离散元素建模设计空间，结合LLMs生成约束和MCTS算法探索空间，实现决策框架IDEA。

Result: 在文章撰写和可视化生成场景中验证，IDEA能跨领域适应并产生优质设计成果。

Conclusion: IDEA框架有效填补设计空间自动化的空白，提升设计效率和成果质量。

Abstract: Design spaces serve as a conceptual framework that enables designers to
explore feasible solutions through the selection and combination of design
elements. However, effective decision-making remains heavily dependent on the
designer's experience, and the absence of mathematical formalization prevents
computational support for automated design processes. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a structured representation that models design spaces with orthogonal
dimensions and discrete selectable elements. Building on this model, we present
IDEA, a decision-making framework for augmenting design intelligence through
design space exploration to generate effective outcomes. Specifically, IDEA
leverages large language models (LLMs) for constraint generation, incorporates
a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm guided by these constraints to
explore the design space efficiently, and instantiates abstract decisions into
domain-specific implementations. We validate IDEA in two design scenarios:
data-driven article composition and pictorial visualization generation,
supported by example results, expert interviews, and a user study. The
evaluation demonstrates the IDEA's adaptability across domains and its
capability to produce superior design outcomes.

TL;DR: 研究了IDE界面设计对ADHD学生的影响，发现当前设计存在挫败感和障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨IDE设计如何影响ADHD学生的学习体验和参与度。

Method: 通过"大声思考"研究和定性观察访谈，分析9名学生在Visual Studio Code中的使用体验。

Result: 识别出三个主题：自信心、互动和学习，揭示了当前IDE设计的不足。

Conclusion: 呼吁改进IDE设计，以提升ADHD学生的学习体验和可访问性。

Abstract: Coding forms a key part of computer science education in universities. As
part of this education, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are
essential tools for coding. However, it is currently unknown how the design of
an IDE's interface impacts on students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD).
  In this study we investigated the use of IDEs by students with ADHD. We
conducted a think aloud study with nine university computing students, followed
by qualitative observational interviews to analyse their learning and
engagement with the Visual Studio Code IDE. The paper reports on these
experiences and seeks to understand the role IDEs play in the educational
setting.
  Our work also examines how digital accessibility and usability are considered
in the current design of IDEs. We analysed the qualitative data using a
thematic analysis and identified three primary themes: self-confidence,
interaction, and learning as well as various sub-themes.
  The themes and their sub-themes illustrate key areas of consideration when
designing IDEs for students with ADHD. The primary findings highlight
experiences of frustration and barriers in the current design and layout of
IDEs.
  Through our participatory approach we provide a rare insight into ADHD user
experiences around usability and accessibility, and describe the need for
better design of development environments to ensure a positive learning
experience for the students.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的文本动画编辑系统，旨在降低非专业人士的使用门槛，提升创作效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动画工作流程对非专业人士操作复杂，阻碍创作效率，亟需简化工具。

Method: 采用基于代理的双流管道，结合上下文感知建议和对话引导，通过语义-动画映射实现LLM驱动的意图翻译，并提供同步预览和统一参数调整。

Result: 用户研究表明，该系统能有效帮助非专业人士完成动画工作流程，验证了管道的可行性。

Conclusion: 研究鼓励进一步探索LLM在视频创作工作流程中的集成。

Abstract: Text animation, a foundational element in video creation, enables efficient
and cost-effective communication, thriving in advertisements, journalism, and
social media. However, traditional animation workflows present significant
usability barriers for non-professionals, with intricate operational procedures
severely hindering creative productivity. To address this, we propose a Large
Language Model (LLM)-aided text animation editing system that enables real-time
intent tracking and flexible editing. The system introduces an agent-based
dual-stream pipeline that integrates context-aware inline suggestions and
conversational guidance as well as employs a semantic-animation mapping to
facilitate LLM-driven creative intent translation. Besides, the system supports
synchronized text-animation previews and parametric adjustments via unified
controls to improve editing workflow. A user study evaluates the system,
highlighting its ability to help non-professional users complete animation
workflows while validating the pipeline. The findings encourage further
exploration of integrating LLMs into a comprehensive video creation workflow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测用户意图抓取的物体可为交互环境提供关键上下文信息，减轻点对点延迟的影响。

Method: 通过记录16名参与者在抓取真实和合成物体时的手部运动数据，使用简单的LSTM网络进行分析。

Result: LSTM网络能预测抓取时间（精度优于21毫秒）、目标距离（精度优于1厘米）和目标大小（准确率高于97%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计自适应、细粒度的交互用户界面（如混合现实环境）提供了重要依据。

Abstract: The ability to predict the object the user intends to grasp offers essential
contextual information and may help to leverage the effects of point-to-point
latency in interactive environments. This paper explores the feasibility and
accuracy of real-time recognition of uninstrumented objects based on hand
kinematics during reach-to-grasp actions. In a data collection study, we
recorded the hand motions of 16 participants while reaching out to grasp and
then moving real and synthetic objects. Our results demonstrate that even a
simple LSTM network can predict the time point at which the user grasps an
object with a precision better than 21 ms and the current distance to this
object with a precision better than 1 cm. The target's size can be determined
in advance with an accuracy better than 97%. Our results have implications for
designing adaptive and fine-grained interactive user interfaces in ubiquitous
and mixed-reality environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种记录手工艺实践中即兴行为的基本语法，并通过CraftLink界面验证其有效性，旨在更好地分享和保存手工艺知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手工艺知识的记录往往忽略即兴和适应性技能，限制了知识的共享和传承。

Method: 结合专家访谈和跨学科文献，开发了一种记录即兴行为的基本语法，并通过CraftLink界面分析专家视频，半自动生成文档。

Result: 用户研究（N=7）表明该语法能有效捕捉和分享专家知识，为计算系统支持社区知识协作提供了新途径。

Conclusion: 该方法为手工艺知识的动态记录和共享提供了新工具，提升了知识传承的深度和广度。

Abstract: Craft practices rely on evolving archives of skill and knowledge, developed
through generations of craftspeople experimenting with designs, materials, and
techniques. Better documentation of these practices enables the sharing of
knowledge and expertise between sites and generations. However, most
documentation focuses solely on the linear steps leading to final artifacts,
neglecting the tacit knowledge necessary to improvise, or adapt workflows to
meet the unique demands of each craft project. This omission limits knowledge
sharing and reduces craft to a mechanical endeavor, rather than a sophisticated
way of seeing, thinking, and doing. Drawing on expert interviews and literature
from HCI, CSCW and the social sciences, we develop an elementary grammar to
document improvisational actions of real-world craft practices. We demonstrate
the utility of this grammar with an interface called CraftLink that can be used
to analyze expert videos and semi-automatically generate documentation to
convey material and contextual variations of craft practices. Our user study
with expert crocheters (N=7) using this interface evaluates our grammar's
effectiveness in capturing and sharing expert knowledge with other
craftspeople, offering new pathways for computational systems to support
collaborative archives of knowledge and practice within communities.

Motivation: 社会连接减少对心理健康和福祉构成威胁，而GAI技术在社交应用中的影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过范围综述分析2020年以来的30项研究，探讨GAI应用的设计、目标社交形式及评估方法。

Result: 发现GAI在故事讲述、情感技能训练等领域的应用趋势，强调参与式设计的重要性，同时指出文化偏见等伦理问题。

Conclusion: GAI有潜力支持个性化互动，但需关注公平设计和包容性评估。

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补关于精神分裂症患者如何在视频博客中构建情感叙事的研究空白。

Method: 基于媒体研究和自我呈现理论，开发视觉分析框架，分析200个YouTube视频。

Result: 发现视觉和语言表达情感的多样性，视觉元素的精心设计能提升观众互动和支持。

Conclusion: 未来需开展大规模定量研究，探索视觉特征如何影响社交媒体上的视频传播，以支持患者管理疾病体验。

Abstract: Individuals with schizophrenia frequently experience intense emotions and
often turn to vlogging as a medium for emotional expression. While previous
research has predominantly focused on text based disclosure, little is known
about how individuals construct narratives around emotions and emotional
experiences in video blogs. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing 200
YouTube videos created by individuals with schizophrenia. Drawing on media
research and self presentation theories, we developed a visual analysis
framework to disentangle these videos. Our analysis revealed diverse practices
of emotion disclosure through both verbal and visual channels, highlighting the
dynamic interplay between these modes of expression. We found that the
deliberate construction of visual elements, including environmental settings
and specific aesthetic choices, appears to foster more supportive and engaged
viewer responses. These findings underscore the need for future large scale
quantitative research examining how visual features shape video mediated
communication on social media platforms. Such investigations would inform the
development of care centered video sharing platforms that better support
individuals managing illness experiences.

Result: 在Benchmark、BETA和自收集数据集上验证了iTRCA和SS-iTRCA的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发高性能SSVEP-BCI提供了减少目标受试者数据需求的解决方案。

Abstract: Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) can achieve high recognition accuracy with sufficient training data.
Transfer learning presents a promising solution to alleviate data requirements
for the target subject by leveraging data from source subjects; however,
effectively addressing individual variability among both target and source
subjects remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning
framework, termed instance-based task-related component analysis (iTRCA), which
leverages knowledge from source subjects while considering their individual
contributions. iTRCA extracts two types of features: (1) the subject-general
feature, capturing shared information between source and target subjects in a
common latent space, and (2) the subject-specific feature, preserving the
unique characteristics of the target subject. To mitigate negative transfer, we
further design an enhanced framework, subject selection-based iTRCA (SS-iTRCA),
which integrates a similarity-based subject selection strategy to identify
appropriate source subjects for transfer based on their task-related components
(TRCs). Comparative evaluations on the Benchmark, BETA, and a self-collected
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iTRCA and SS-iTRCA
frameworks. This study provides a potential solution for developing
high-performance SSVEP-based BCIs with reduced target subject data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态类增量学习方法仅关注视觉和文本，本文探索了视觉、音频和文本的多模态集成，旨在解决信息互补和灾难性遗忘的挑战。

Method: 提出基于Mixture-of-Experts的多模态增量特征提取器（MIFE）、自适应视听融合模块（AAVFM）和多模态类增量对比训练损失。

Result: 在三个多模态数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文方法在多模态类增量学习中表现出色，为多模态数据集成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Wei Li,Mengcheng Lan,Jiaxing Xu,Yiping Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL)框架，通过节点描述和节点概念技术，将LLM扩展到非文本属性图，并统一多级图任务为语言查询格式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络依赖监督学习，泛化能力有限；现有自监督方法仍需标注微调，无法适应零样本场景。LLM在自然语言任务中表现优异，但在图任务中面临推理能力、长文本处理和非文本属性图等挑战。

Method: NOCL采用节点描述（将节点属性转为结构化自然语言）和节点概念（用预训练语言模型编码为紧凑语义嵌入）技术，并设计图表示描述符统一多级任务。

Result: 实验表明NOCL在监督学习中与传统MPNN和混合方法竞争，并在零样本场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: NOCL为图基础模型开辟了新方向，解决了LLM在图任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Result: LSTM-LSTM-TNN精度最高但训练时间长，CNN-LSTM-TNN在精度和速度上表现最优。

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM-TNN是光学逆设计中的理想解决方案，兼顾精度与效率。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

TL;DR: Omni-DPO是一种双视角优化框架，通过动态加权偏好对的质量和模型学习动态，提升数据利用效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法统一处理偏好对，忽略其质量和学习效用差异，导致数据利用和性能不佳。

Method: 提出Omni-DPO，联合考虑偏好对的固有质量和模型学习动态，动态加权样本。

Result: 在文本理解和数学推理任务中，Omni-DPO显著优于基线方法，如Gemma-2-9b-it在Arena-Hard上超越Claude 3 Opus 6.7分。

Conclusion: Omni-DPO通过动态加权优化数据利用，表现出优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Conclusion: 研究为将贝叶斯方法融入LLM时代提供了可行路径，有助于构建更可靠和校准的LLM系统。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Motivation: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Result: 模型在MNIST数据集上表现出色，通过Silhouette Score、Davies-Bouldin Index、NMI和ARI等指标验证了其优越的聚类性能，并通过t-SNE可视化展示了清晰的数字聚类。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据重建精度和聚类纯度之间取得了平衡，具有可解释性和可扩展性，为无监督表示学习在大规模图像聚类中的应用提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在个性化学习、通信效率和协作效果方面表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

Motivation: 自然对象通常复杂且多变，传统模拟方法计算成本高，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 采用基于分数的扩散模型，结合退火Langevin动力学，强制生成过程中的非负性。

Result: 生成的3D云在物理趋势上与真实云一致，专家难以区分其非物理性。

Conclusion: NnD是一种高效且物理意义明确的生成方法，适用于非负对象的模拟和推断。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的AL方法主要在静态数据集上评估，忽视了用户中心因素（如多样性、公平性和动态适应性），需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架，引入新指标评估AL方法的持续有效性、多样性和用户负担，并在动态真实数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验揭示了预测性能与用户负担之间的权衡，证明了平衡节点重要性、查询多样性和网络拓扑的重要性。

Conclusion: GRAIL为动态环境中的图AL方法提供了全面评估机制，强调了用户中心因素的重要性。

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: A-CAPELLA算法在无感知且臂容量未知的去中心化多玩家多臂老虎机问题中表现出高效的学习能力，为类似问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Method: 将ODR形式化为参数化模拟器家族的最大似然估计，证明其一致性，推导误差界限，并引入E-DROPO算法。

Result: ODR的模拟到现实误差比均匀DR更紧，E-DROPO通过熵奖励防止方差崩溃，提升零样本迁移鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ODR为模拟到现实迁移提供了理论支持，E-DROPO进一步优化了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）在处理新颖状态-目标对时表现不佳，主要原因是状态表示缺乏时间一致性。改进这一点可以提升组合泛化能力。

Method: 提出BYOL-γ增强的GCBC方法，通过一种简单的表示学习目标，无需对比样本或TD学习即可近似后继表示。

Result: 该方法在需要组合泛化的任务中表现出色，且理论上能在有限MDP情况下近似后继表示。

Conclusion: BYOL-γ增强的GCBC通过改进时间一致性，显著提升了组合泛化能力，为行为克隆提供了新思路。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Conclusion: 尽管网络机制与经典搜索不同，但其利用测试时间计算的机制可以被理解为熟悉的术语，表明其可解释性。

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Conclusion: WBSAC通过定向探索策略有效提升了样本效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生理模型的神经网络框架（PMB-NN），用于通过日常活动中的氧摄取数据估计心率，显著优于传统生理模型，并实现了个性化参数识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心衰早期检测对改善预后至关重要，但现有心率监测工具依赖群体平均值，缺乏个性化。

Method: 结合生理约束的神经网络框架（PMB-NN），基于氧摄取数据训练和测试，嵌入简化生理模型。

Result: PMB-NN在R²分数中位数为0.8，RMSE为8.3 bpm，性能优于传统生理模型（p=0.002）。

Conclusion: PMB-NN框架为个性化实时心脏监测提供了可能，适用于日常活动中的心脏健康追踪。

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双曲嵌入的方法（Balanced Hyperbolic Learning），用于区分分布内和分布外样本，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中的分布外识别问题，提出双曲嵌入优于传统方法。

Method: 引入平衡双曲学习，优化层次失真和子层次平衡，将双曲嵌入用于分类和分布外评分。

Result: 在13个数据集和13种评分函数上，双曲嵌入表现优于现有方法和对比学习。

Conclusion: 双曲嵌入在分布外识别中表现优越，支持层次化泛化。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

TL;DR: VCL（变分对比学习）通过引入概率嵌入和KL散度正则化，为对比学习提供了不确定性量化机制，同时保持或超越确定性基线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法（如SimCLR和SupCon）缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出VCL框架，将InfoNCE损失视为重建项，并添加KL散度正则化，使用投影正态分布建模后验分布。

Result: VCL缓解了维度崩溃，增强了与类标签的互信息，分类精度与基线相当或更高，并提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: VCL为对比学习提供了概率基础，可作为新的对比学习方法基础。

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are emerging as a powerful framework for
interpretable and efficient system identification in dynamic systems. By
leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs enable function
approximation through learnable activation functions, offering improved
scalability, accuracy, and interpretability compared to traditional neural
networks. This paper investigates the application of KANs to model and analyze
the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter
estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data,
the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs,
constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these
models through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the ability of
KANs to accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and
detect parameter changes, providing valuable insights into their applicability

Conclusion: 扩散生成模型的采样轨迹具有普适的几何规律性，动态规划方法可高效优化采样过程。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D

molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of

equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现实观测数据中存在异质子群，传统模型常忽略这些群体，导致预测不准确甚至有害。现有解决方案多将此类样本视为OOD，而非适应新模式。

Method: DynaSubVAE结合表示学习和自适应OOD检测，利用非参数聚类机制（受高斯混合模型启发）动态发现和建模潜在子群。

Result: 实验表明，DynaSubVAE在近OOD和远OOD检测中表现优异，尤其在训练中缺失整类的场景下。其动态子群机制优于GMM和KMeans++。

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE通过动态子群化和自适应OOD检测，显著提升模型对异质子群的捕捉能力，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2为模拟拓扑生成提供了高效、精确且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering填补了联邦学习研究的空白，具有隐私保护、通信高效和灵活性等优势。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

### [179] [Graph-MLLM: Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10282)
*Jiajin Liu,Dongzhe Fan,Jiacheng Shen,Chuanhao Ji,Daochen Zha,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Graph-MLLM，一个多模态图学习的综合基准，系统评估了三种范式（Encoder、Aligner、Predictor）在六个不同领域数据集上的表现。实验表明，联合考虑节点的视觉和文本属性对图学习有益，且将视觉属性转换为文本描述能进一步提升性能。微调MLLMs在多数场景下能达到最优效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多模态图学习中缺乏统一的评估基准，难以公平比较不同方法的进展。

Method: 提出了Graph-MLLM基准，系统评估Encoder、Aligner、Predictor三种范式，并在六个数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，联合视觉和文本属性对图学习有益，视觉属性转换为文本描述效果更佳，微调MLLMs在多数场景下表现最优。

Conclusion: Graph-MLLM为多模态图学习提供了统一的评估基准，推动了该领域的公平比较和进一步创新。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Motivation: 解决标准算法可能导致组间探索成本不平衡的问题，平衡组间的探索负担。

Result: Col-UCB实现了最优的极小极大和实例依赖协作遗憾，适应组间共享动作集的结构。

Conclusion: 协作在某些情况下能显著优于各组独立学习最佳动作。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科上的恶意傀儡账户检测对维护互联网可靠信息和防止虚假信息传播至关重要，但现有方法难以适应特定作者行为。

Result: 实验表明，元学习方法显著优于预训练模型，提升了预测精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在开放编辑平台上对抗傀儡账户行为方面取得了进展，并发布了新数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PyLO是一个基于PyTorch的库，旨在将学习优化器推广到更广泛的机器学习社区，提供用户友好的工具和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习优化器（如VeLO）因依赖JAX和缺乏用户友好工具而难以普及，PyLO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过PyTorch实现学习优化器，支持CUDA加速，并结合现有优化工具（如学习率调度和权重衰减）。

Result: PyLO显著提升了训练速度（如ViT B/16训练吞吐量从39.36提高到205.59样本/秒），并展示了学习优化器与其他工具结合的优势。

Conclusion: PyLO为学习优化器的实际应用提供了便捷途径，并展示了其在真实任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

Motivation: 发展中国家空气污染严重，但现有AQI数据因传感器稀疏无法反映局部真实情况。

Method: 使用时空图神经网络（Spatio-temporal GNNs）预测AQI，以AirDelhi数据集为例。

Result: 预测性能超越现有方法71.654 MSE（减少79%），并在未见坐标上表现良好，同时发现AQI的短期重复模式和空间关系变化。

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确地预测局部AQI，为空气质量管理提供新工具和见解。

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型（LLM）的交互学习缺乏理论框架，本文旨在填补这一空白，为从语言反馈中学习提供理论基础。

Method: 通过形式化LLF问题，提出转移回避维度作为复杂性度量，并开发无遗憾算法HELiX，通过顺序交互解决LLF问题。

Result: 研究表明，语言反馈可以比奖励学习快指数级，HELiX算法在多个实验领域中表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文为从通用语言反馈中设计交互学习算法迈出了第一步，为未来研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理信号常受运动伪影、基线漂移和低信噪比干扰，传统方法难以处理其非平稳性和突变特征。

Method: 采用小波变换捕捉多尺度时频特征，构建针对EMG和ECG的预训练模型，并设计多模态融合框架。

Result: 在单模态和多模态任务中表现优异，解决了低信噪比、高个体差异和设备不匹配等问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为生理信号分析奠定基础，对可穿戴健康监测和临床诊断具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

Motivation: 研究动机是通过可观测数据推断材料响应的不可逆演化，克服传统RNN模型在路径依赖性建模中的局限性。

Method: 方法包括开发HANO模型，结合傅里叶神经算子框架和分层自注意力机制，实现离散不变学习和多尺度特征提取。

Result: 结果表明HANO在预测精度、泛化能力和鲁棒性上优于基线模型，适用于复杂条件下的材料模拟。

Conclusion: HANO为模拟非弹性材料提供了高效的数据驱动替代方案，适合与传统数值求解器集成。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Result: 在视觉Transformer和大型语言模型上的实验表明，该方法在视觉和自然语言处理任务中均表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: TreeLoRA为大型预训练模型的持续学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Result: 实验证明攻击方法在多预训练LLMs上成功，揭示了LLMs的新漏洞。

Conclusion: LLMs在微调过程中存在属性泄露风险，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究强调了控制基础模型变异的重要性，为揭示潜在能力间的因果关系提供了科学依据。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Conclusion: PAJAMA是一种高效、低成本且可解释的LLM评估替代方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

TL;DR: Time-IMM数据集和IMM-TSF基准库旨在解决现实世界中不规则、多模态时间序列数据的挑战，填补研究与实践之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列数据（如医疗、气候和金融领域）通常不规则、多模态且杂乱，而现有基准假设数据干净、规则且单模态。

Method: 提出Time-IMM数据集，捕捉九种不规则性类型；开发IMM-TSF基准库，支持异步多模态融合和评估。

Result: 实验表明，显式建模多模态和不规则性显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-IMM和IMM-TSF为现实条件下时间序列分析提供了基础工具和数据集。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the
benchmark library can be accessed at

*Weiying Zhao,Aleksei Unagaev,Natalia Efremova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合光谱聚类和cLHS的新方法，用于提升土壤有机碳（SOC）采样的代表性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统cLHS方法可能忽略重要的小环境区域，影响SOC预测的准确性。

Method: 通过光谱聚类将研究区域划分为K个同质区域，再在每个区域内应用cLHS选择采样点。

Result: 光谱-cLHS方法比标准cLHS更能均匀覆盖环境特征空间和空间异质性。

Conclusion: 该方法有望通过提供更平衡的训练数据，提高SOC预测的准确性。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Method: 采用模型量化、DRAM-Flash混合存储、权重重排、多核负载均衡等技术。

Result: MNN-LLM比主流框架快8.6倍。

Conclusion: MNN-LLM为移动设备上的LLM部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a variety of tasks. However, their substantial scale leads to significant
computational resource consumption during inference, resulting in high costs.
Consequently, edge device inference presents a promising solution. The primary
challenges of edge inference include memory usage and inference speed. This
paper introduces MNN-LLM, a framework specifically designed to accelerate the
deployment of large language models on mobile devices. MNN-LLM addresses the
runtime characteristics of LLMs through model quantization and DRAM-Flash
hybrid storage, effectively reducing memory usage. It rearranges weights and
inputs based on mobile CPU instruction sets and GPU characteristics while
employing strategies such as multicore load balancing, mixed-precision
floating-point operations, and geometric computations to enhance performance.
Notably, MNN-LLM achieves up to a 8.6x speed increase compared to current
mainstream LLM-specific frameworks.

Conclusion: END通过可学习的正向过程，为分子生成提供了更灵活且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Diffusion (END), a novel diffusion model for
molecule generation in 3D that is equivariant to Euclidean transformations.
Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key
innovation in END lies in its learnable forward process for enhanced generative
modelling. Rather than pre-specified, the forward process is parameterized
through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid
transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule
generation benchmarks, we demonstrate the competitive performance of END
compared to several strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional
generation.

Motivation: 探讨在数据有限的情况下，机器学习模型如何有效预测电力市场价格，尤其是季节性趋势和价格峰值。

Method: 使用LSTM、XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost四种模型，基于7至90天的训练窗口，在三个欧洲电力市场进行测试。

Result: LightGBM在45和60天训练窗口下表现最优，能更好地捕捉季节性趋势和价格峰值。

Conclusion: 短期训练窗口结合提升方法（如LightGBM）可有效支持数据稀缺环境下的电力市场价格预测。

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in
forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical
training windows, with a focus on detecting seasonal trends and price spikes.
We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece,
Belgium, Ireland) using feature sets derived from ENTSO-E forecast data.
Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that
LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness,
particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal
relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior
detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other
boosting models. These findings suggest that short-window training approaches,
combined with boosting methods, can effectively support DAM forecasting in
volatile, data-scarce environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的自动化方法，用于优化PCB设计中的组件添加，以减少人工干预并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏熟练工程师且手动优化耗时，PCB设计中的最佳实践常被忽视，导致后期开发成本高和产品生命周期短。

Method: 将PCB设计表示为二分图，并利用GNN的节点对预测模型自动添加组件。

Result: 在三个PCB设计优化任务中，GNN表现出高准确性，证明了该方法的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效自动化PCB设计优化，节省时间和成本。

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的、适应规模的假设检验框架，用于基于统计证据评估算法决策系统的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性评估方法依赖单点估计，忽略抽样误差和不同规模子组的差异，尤其在交叉分析中数据稀疏性导致结果不可靠。

Method: 结合中心极限定理推导的Wald检验（大子组）和贝叶斯Dirichlet-多项式估计（小子组），提供统计严格的公平性决策。

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了在不同数据量和交叉性下的可解释性和统计严谨性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为公平性评估提供了统计可靠且适应数据规模的解决方案。

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

### [200] [Non-stationary Online Learning for Curved Losses: Improved Dynamic Regret via Mixability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10616)
*Yu-Jie Zhang,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法，用于准确数字化纸质心电图（ECG）记录，特别针对信号重叠问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在数字化纸质ECG记录时对信号重叠问题的不足，提高数字化精度。

Method: 采用基于U-Net的分割网络和自适应网格检测模块的两阶段流程，分别处理ECG信号的分割和数字化。

Result: U-Net分割IoU为0.87；数字化方法在非重叠和重叠信号上均优于基线（MSE和Pearson系数显著提升）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了ECG记录的数字化准确性，尤其在信号重叠情况下，为研究和临床应用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据下，传统图学习方法因计算复杂度高而难以应用，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用条件相关矩阵的低秩分解，结合Riemannian优化技术，提出了一种改进的GLasso算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高维数据下实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡。

Conclusion: 低秩分解结合Riemannian优化是解决高维图学习问题的有效方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

Motivation: 解决MISL方法在无监督强化学习中缺乏理论分析的问题，特别是其对下游任务策略初始化的影响。

Method: 提出LSEPIN度量，构建信息几何连接，并基于Wasserstein距离提出WSEP和PWSEP算法。

Result: WSEP和PWSEP在理论上能更好地支持下游任务适应，并发现更多初始策略。

Conclusion: 基于Wasserstein距离的方法优于MISL，能更有效地发现最优初始策略。

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法缺乏显式的时间序列推理过程，而LLMs虽具备多步推理能力，但仅依赖提示工程存在计算成本高、隐私风险等问题。

Method: 提出Time-R1框架，分两阶段：监督微调用于预热适应，强化学习提升泛化能力，并设计细粒度多目标奖励和GRIP优化推理路径。

Result: 实验表明Time-R1在多种数据集上显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-R1通过强化微调LLMs，有效解决了时间序列预测中的推理问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型潜在空间的复杂结构及其与相变现象的联系提供了新见解。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 尽管CoT被证明能提升模型性能，但其依赖的训练假设（如数据分布一致性和无污染数据）在现实中难以满足。本文首次系统研究了数据偏移对CoT性能的具体影响。

Method: 通过k-parity问题，分析数据分布偏移和数据污染的联合影响，对比CoT分解与直接预测的性能差异。

Result: 发现CoT在数据偏移情况下表现更差，且揭示了其机制原因。

Conclusion: CoT在现实数据偏移场景中可能不如直接预测有效，需进一步优化其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

Motivation: 持续学习中神经网络常面临灾难性遗忘问题，传统自组织映射（SOMs）也存在此缺陷。

Method: SatSOM通过逐步降低学习率和邻域半径的饱和机制，冻结训练良好的神经元并将学习重定向到未充分利用的区域。

Result: SatSOM在持续学习场景中表现出更好的知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SatSOM为持续学习提供了一种有效的解决方案，尤其适用于需要长期知识保留的任务。

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

Method: SPLICE使用斜投影技术，移除敏感概念方向的同时保护标签相关性。

Result: 在Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准测试中，SPLICE优于基线方法，移除保护属性且对主任务信息损害最小。

Conclusion: SPLICE是唯一能线性移除概念并保持目标协方差的解决方案，理论独特且实证有效。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Motivation: 当前表格原生ICL架构仅依赖合成数据，未能充分利用真实数据的语义；而基于大语言模型的ICL方法受限于上下文容量。

Method: 引入ConTextTab，结合语义理解与表格原生ICL，采用多模态嵌入并训练于大规模真实数据。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在语义丰富的CARTE基准上创下新标准。

Conclusion: ConTextTab成功融合了两种方法的优势，为表格ICL提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Motivation: 解决临床QA中精确证据检索和有限监督下忠实答案生成的挑战，提升AI在医疗领域的可靠性。

Method: 将任务分为句子级证据识别和带引用的答案合成，利用DSPy的MIPROv2优化器自动探索提示空间，并通过自一致性投票提高证据召回率。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上获得51.5分，优于零样本和少样本提示方法20分和10分。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的提示优化是模型微调的高效替代方案，可提升临床QA的可靠性。

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence

ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly

score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint

Result: 几乎匹配的上下界结果覆盖了所有ε范围，首次实现了相对误差控制。

Conclusion: 本文首次解决了单调分类中相对误差控制的问题，为未来研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

Motivation: 改进传统log-sum-exponential (LSE)函数在DenseAM中的局限性，实现更高效的记忆存储和生成任务。

Method: 基于Epanechnikov核设计LSR能量函数，无需指数分离函数即可实现精确记忆检索。

Result: LSR具有更多局部极小值（记忆点），且在图像数据上表现出创造性和新颖性。

Conclusion: LSR在DenseAM中展现出潜力，适用于大规模记忆存储和生成任务。

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

Method: 通过评估多种探针架构在合成数据上的表现，并测试其在真实数据上的泛化能力。

Result: 探针性能接近中型LLM监控器，计算成本低六个数量级，适合作为分层监控系统的初始过滤器。

Conclusion: 激活探针是一种高效且低成本的高风险交互监控方法，适合构建资源感知的分层监控系统。

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了动态深度学习系统（DDLSs）的效率鲁棒性，首次提出了效率攻击的综合分类，并分析了现有防御机制的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习系统在实时应用中的部署增加，动态行为虽然提高了效率，但也引入了新的攻击面，尤其是效率对抗攻击。

Method: 通过分类三种动态行为（动态计算、动态推理迭代、动态输出生产）的攻击，深入评估了针对DDLSs效率的对抗策略。

Result: 研究发现现有防御机制对效率攻击的防护不足，需开发新的缓解策略。

Conclusion: 未来需要针对适应性DDLSs设计更有效的安全措施。

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何在未知干扰下通过熵正则化和约束惩罚实现强化学习中的鲁棒安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）近期取得许多进展，但在未知干扰下学习鲁棒满足状态约束的策略仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 通过分析熵正则化和约束惩罚的相互作用，论文提出了一种方法：通过放松严格安全约束为惩罚，将约束RL问题近似为无约束问题，从而利用标准模型无关RL解决。

Result: 实验表明，熵正则化在约束RL中偏向最大化未来可行动作数量，提升对动作噪声的鲁棒性；松弛约束的惩罚方法在保持安全性和最优性的同时提高了对干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 熵正则化与鲁棒性的关联是一个有前景的研究方向，通过简单奖励塑形即可实现RL中的鲁棒安全性。

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Motivation: 分类器混合模型被认为能提高对抗攻击的鲁棒性，但现有攻击方法并不适合此类模型，因此需要一种更有效的攻击方法。

Result: 实验证明，新攻击方法在合成和真实数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: lattice climber attack是一种更有效的攻击分类器混合模型的方法，满足提出的两个属性。

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Duo方法通过高斯扩散技术的迁移，显著提升了均匀状态扩散模型的性能，为快速文本生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NoLoCo的新型优化方法，通过避免显式同步模型参数，减少通信开销，适用于低带宽网络环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型训练通常需要高带宽互联的计算集群，成本高昂且扩展受限。现有低通信训练方法仍需同步步骤，导致低带宽网络下效率低下。

Method: NoLoCo采用一种基于Nesterov动量的优化器变体，通过随机选择部分模型权重进行隐式同步，避免集体通信。

Result: 实验表明，NoLoCo在125M至6.8B参数的模型上显著减少通信开销，同步速度比DiLoCo快一个数量级，且收敛速度提升4%。

Conclusion: NoLoCo是一种高效的低通信训练方法，适用于大规模模型训练，尤其在低带宽网络中表现优异。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

Conclusion: CausalFM为因果推断提供了一种新范式，有望改变医学、经济学等领域的实践方式。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

Conclusion: PSMs为神经序列模型的设计提供了新的方向，兼具高效性和表达能力。

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险招聘应用中的偏见问题直接影响职业和生计，需探索更有效的偏见缓解方法。

Method: 通过识别并中和模型激活中的敏感属性方向，采用内部偏见缓解策略（如仿射概念编辑）。

Result: 在真实上下文中，模型表现出显著种族和性别偏见（面试率差异达12%），内部缓解方法将偏见降至1%以下。

Conclusion: 建议采用更现实的评估方法和内部缓解策略，以确保招聘中的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

TL;DR: SEAL框架让大语言模型（LLM）通过生成自己的微调数据和更新指令实现自我适应，无需依赖外部模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM静态性，无法适应新任务或知识的问题。

Method: 模型生成自我编辑指令，通过监督微调（SFT）实现权重更新，结合强化学习优化生成效果。

Result: 在知识整合和少样本泛化任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: SEAL是实现语言模型自我适应的重要进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUARD是一个针对大语言模型（LLM）的轻量级框架，通过数据归因指标和自适应权重分配，减少遗忘特定数据时对模型效用的负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于法规合规、版权保护和隐私问题，LLM的遗忘需求增加，但现有方法容易导致意外遗忘和模型效用下降。

Method: GUARD引入了一种轻量级代理数据归因指标，量化遗忘集和保留集的“对齐”程度，并通过自适应权重分配优化遗忘目标。

Result: 实验表明，GUARD在TOFU基准测试中显著提升了效用保留，同时保持遗忘效果，效用牺牲减少了194.92%。

Conclusion: GUARD通过数据归因和自适应权重分配，有效解决了LLM遗忘中的意外遗忘问题，提升了模型效用。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

*Boaz Lavon,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EG-CFG的新方法，将实时执行信号融入语言模型生成过程，显著提升代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在代码生成时未利用执行反馈，而人类程序员常依赖此类信号。EG-CFG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用多阶段流程：1）通过束搜索生成候选代码行；2）执行测试用例提取信号；3）将信号融入生成过程。

Result: 实验表明EG-CFG在多种编码任务中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: EG-CFG通过动态整合执行信号，有效提升了代码生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理在处理复杂网页输入时存在显著挑战，如处理庞大的DOM树或依赖增强截图，亟需一种专为代理优化的新交互范式。

Result: AWI旨在克服现有界面的根本限制，提升网络代理的效率、可靠性和透明度。

Conclusion: AWI的提出为网络代理设计开辟了新方向，需要更广泛的ML社区合作推进。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance是一种简单的方法，用于提升扩散模型在逆问题中的样本真实性和奖励效果，通过反向运行无条件概率流ODE并重新初始化DPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的逆问题解决方法在低信噪比情况下容易偏离数据流形，导致输出不真实。

Method: 提出ReGuidance方法，通过反向运行无条件概率流ODE并重新初始化DPS来优化候选解。

Result: 在困难的逆问题（如大区域修复和高倍超分辨率）中，ReGuidance显著提升了样本质量和测量一致性。

Conclusion: ReGuidance是首个为DPS提供严格算法保证的方法，能同时提升奖励和保持数据流形接近性。

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL在结构化几何数据中的理论基础，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过建立注意力机制与经典核方法的新联系，分析ICL在流形上Hölder函数回归中的表现。

Result: 当训练任务足够多时，变换器能够达到流形上Hölder函数的最小极大回归率，且误差随流形内禀维度而非环境维度指数变化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了几何在ICL中的关键作用，并为非线性模型的ICL研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型训练成本高昂的问题，避免小规模实验结论无法推广到生产系统的局限性。

Method: 系统构建模型损失表面L(N,D)，并通过训练约1000个不同规模和配置的LLM验证方法。

Result: Farseer在预测准确性和外推能力上优于Chinchilla定律，减少了433%的外推误差。

Conclusion: Farseer为LLM训练提供了更可靠的预测工具，优化了计算资源分配，并开源了所有数据和模型以促进研究。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

TL;DR: 扩散桥是一种用于从未归一化分布中采样的深度学习方法。研究发现，Log Variance (LV) 损失在使用重参数化技巧计算rKL梯度时表现优于反向Kullback-Leibler (rKL) 损失。但对于扩散桥或学习扩散系数的情况，LV损失与rKL损失的等价性不成立。分析表明，使用对数导数技巧的rKL损失（rKL-LD）不仅避免了概念问题，还优于LV损失。实验证明rKL-LD在性能和训练稳定性上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散桥方法中损失函数的选择问题，探讨LV损失与rKL损失的等价性及其适用性。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较LV损失与rKL-LD损失在扩散桥方法中的表现。

Result: rKL-LD损失在性能上优于LV损失，且训练更稳定，超参数优化需求更少。

Conclusion: 对于扩散桥方法，rKL-LD损失是更优的选择，解决了LV损失的概念问题并提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

TL;DR: AniMaker是一个多智能体框架，通过高效生成多候选视频片段和故事感知的片段选择，解决了多场景和角色视频生成的连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成方法在生成多场景和角色的连贯故事视频时存在叙事断裂和节奏问题，且模型的不稳定性可能导致整体质量下降。

Method: AniMaker采用多智能体框架，包括导演、摄影、评审和后期制作代理，结合MCTS-Gen和AniEval技术，优化片段生成和评估。

Result: 实验表明，AniMaker在VBench和AniEval等指标上表现优异，显著提升了多候选生成的效率和故事连贯性。

Conclusion: AniMaker将AI生成的故事动画推向更高标准，接近生产水平。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

Conclusion: 论文为混合策略NE的学习提供了理论支持，同时指出了学习动力学的局限性，并通过ABR属性为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: We study learnability of mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) in general
finite games using higher-order replicator dynamics as well as classes of
higher-order uncoupled heterogeneous dynamics. In higher-order uncoupled
learning dynamics, players have no access to utilities of opponents (uncoupled)
but are allowed to use auxiliary states to further process information
(higher-order). We establish a link between uncoupled learning and feedback
stabilization with decentralized control. Using this association, we show that
for any finite game with an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist
higher-order uncoupled learning dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE. We
further establish the lack of universality of learning dynamics by linking
learning to the control theoretic concept of simultaneous stabilization. We
construct two games such that any higher-order dynamics that learn the
completely mixed-strategy NE of one of these games can never learn the
completely mixed-strategy NE of the other. Next, motivated by imposing natural
restrictions on allowable learning dynamics, we introduce the Asymptotic Best
Response (ABR) property. Dynamics with the ABR property asymptotically learn a
best response in environments that are asymptotically stationary. We show that
the ABR property relates to an internal stability condition on higher-order
learning dynamics. We provide conditions under which NE are compatible with the
ABR property. Finally, we address learnability of mixed-strategy NE in the
bandit setting using a bandit version of higher-order replicator dynamics.

Motivation: 联邦音频分类面临数据异质性、模型异质性和数据中毒三大挑战，现有方法缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 提出FedMLAC框架，采用双模型架构（个性化本地模型和轻量级全局插件模型），结合双向知识蒸馏和层剪枝聚合策略。

Result: 在四个音频分类基准测试中，FedMLAC在分类准确性和抗噪性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedMLAC为联邦音频分类提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案，兼顾泛化性和个性化。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving paradigm for training
audio classification (AC) models across distributed clients without sharing raw
data. However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical
challenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model
heterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address
these issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and
robust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this
gap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to
simultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC
introduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized
local AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through
bidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global
knowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus
supporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance
robustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning
Aggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based
on parameter deviations during server-side aggregation. Extensive experiments
on four diverse audio classification benchmarks, spanning both speech and
non-speech tasks, demonstrate that FedMLAC consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to
noisy data.

manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

Motivation: 尽管音频-LLM的应用开发进展迅速，但其底层机制（如音频编码器与LLM的高效语义传递）仍未被充分探索。本文旨在通过架构设计优化这种跨模态交互。

Method: 从标准音频-LLM架构出发，提出并评估了三种改进：延迟音频集成、仅通过注意力模块探测音频表示、多音频编码器集成。实验基于560万音频-文本对数据集。

Conclusion: 通过系统优化架构设计，可以有效提升音频-LLM的跨模态信息传递能力，为未来研究提供了参考。

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

Abstract: Spatial Semantic Segmentation of Sound Scenes (S5) aims to enhance
technologies for sound event detection and separation from multi-channel input
signals that mix multiple sound events with spatial information. This is a
fundamental basis of immersive communication. The ultimate goal is to separate
sound event signals with 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) information into dry sound
object signals and metadata about the object type (sound event class) and
representing spatial information, including direction. However, because several
existing challenge tasks already provide some of the subset functions, this
task for this year focuses on detecting and separating sound events from
multi-channel spatial input signals. This paper outlines the S5 task setting of
the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2025
Challenge Task 4 and the DCASE2025 Task 4 Dataset, newly recorded and curated
for this task. We also report experimental results for an S5 system trained and
evaluated on this dataset. The full version of this paper will be published

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法BNMusic，通过生成个性化音乐来掩盖环境噪音，减少噪音感知，提升听觉体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声学掩蔽技术因噪音与掩蔽声音不匹配（如节拍不一致）需要增加音量，效果有限。受跨模态生成技术启发，作者提出通过生成与噪音融合的个性化音乐来解决问题。

Method: 采用BNMusic框架，分两阶段：1）基于用户文本提示生成包含噪音音乐特征的mel谱图音乐；2）自适应放大音乐段以增强掩蔽效果，同时保持音质。

Result: 在MusicBench、EPIC-SOUNDS和ESC-50数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效生成节奏对齐、放大的音乐段，显著降低噪音感知。

Conclusion: BNMusic框架通过生成个性化音乐，成功减少了环境噪音的感知，为声学掩蔽提供了新思路。

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Abstract: Neuromorphic control is receiving growing attention due to the multifaceted
advantages it brings over more classical control approaches, including: sparse
and on-demand sensing, information transmission, and actuation;
energy-efficient designs and realizations in neuromorphic hardware; event-based
signal processing and control signal computation. However, a general
control-theoretical formalization of what "neuromorphic control systems" are
and how we can rigorously analyze, design, and control them is still largely
missing. In this note, we suggest a possible path toward formalizing
neuromorphic control systems. We apply the proposed framework to a rhythmic
control case study and rigorously show how it has the potential to make
neuromorphic control systems analysis and design amenable to mature control
theoretical approaches like describing function analysis and harmonic balance,
fast-slow analysis, discrete and hybrid systems, and robust optimization.

Result: 该方法能有效平衡热舒适性、电池健康、预热需求和续航里程。

Conclusion: 实时MPC为电池能量分配提供了更优的动态解决方案，提升了整体能源效率。

Abstract: In autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), battery energy must be judiciously
allocated to satisfy primary propulsion demands and secondary auxiliary
demands, particularly the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
system. This becomes especially critical when the battery is in a low state of
charge under cold ambient conditions, and cabin heating and battery
preconditioning (prior to actual charging) can consume a significant percentage
of available energy, directly impacting the driving range. In such cases, one
usually prioritizes propulsion or applies heuristic rules for thermal
management, often resulting in suboptimal energy utilization. There is a
pressing need for a principled approach that can dynamically allocate battery
power in a way that balances thermal comfort, battery health and
preconditioning, along with range preservation. This paper attempts to address
this issue using real-time Model Predictive Control to optimize the power
consumption between the propulsion, HVAC, and battery temperature preparation
so that it can be charged immediately once the destination is reached.

Conclusion: 该算法有效解决了相机位置优化问题，提升了眼到手配置中的观测精度。

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

Abstract: Infinite-time nonlinear optimal regulation control is widely utilized in
aerospace engineering as a systematic method for synthesizing stable
controllers. However, conventional methods often rely on linearization
hypothesis, while recent learning-based approaches rarely consider stability
guarantees. This paper proposes a learning-based framework to learn a stable
optimal controller for nonlinear optimal regulation problems. First, leveraging
the equivalence between Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) and
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, we improve the backward generation of
optimal examples (BGOE) method for infinite-time optimal regulation problems. A
state-transition-matrix-guided data generation method is then proposed to
efficiently generate a complete dataset that covers the desired state space.
Finally, we incorporate the Lyapunov stability condition into the learning
framework, ensuring the stability of the learned optimal policy by jointly
learning the optimal value function and control policy. Simulations on three
nonlinear optimal regulation problems show that the learned optimal policy
achieves near-optimal regulation control and the code is provided at

Conclusion: 提出的非光滑CBF合成方法为切换仿射系统提供了一种有效的安全控制策略，并通过自动化工具实现了高效合成。

Abstract: We study the problem of synthesizing non-smooth control barrier functions
(CBFs) for continuous-time switched affine systems. Switched affine systems are
defined by a set of affine dynamical modes, wherein the control consists of a
state-based switching signal that determines the current operating mode. The
control barrier functions seek to maintain the system state inside a control
invariant set that excludes a given set of unsafe states. We consider CBFs that
take the form of pointwise minima and maxima over a finite set of affine
functions. Our approach uses ideas from nonsmooth analysis to formulate
conditions for min- and max- affine control barrier functions. We show how a
feedback switching law can be extracted from a given CBF. Next, we show how to
automate the process of synthesizing CBFs given a system description through a
tree-search algorithm inspired by branch-and-cut methods from combinatorial
optimization. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on a series of interesting
examples of switched affine systems.

Result: V2X增强的刹车系统比纯传感器系统在碰撞避免上表现更优。

Conclusion: V2X技术能显著提升自动刹车系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: By using an automated braking system, such as the Automatic Emergency Brake
(AEB), crashes can be avoided in situations where the driver is unaware of an
imminent collision. However, conventional AEB systems detect potential
collision adversaries with onboard sensor systems, such as radars and cameras,
that may fail in non-line-of-sight situations. By leveraging
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, information regarding an approaching
vehicle can be received by the ego vehicle at an early point in time, even if
the opponent vehicle is occluded by a view obstruction. In this work, we
consider a 2-stage braking cascade, consisting of a partial brake, triggered
based on V2X information, and a sensor-triggered AEB. We evaluate its crash
avoidance performance in real-world crash situations extracted from the German
In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) database using an accident simulation
framework. The results are compared against a sensor-triggered AEB system and a
purely V2X-triggered partial brake. To further analyze the results, we identify
the crash cause for each situation in which the brake function under test could
not prevent the crash. The simulation results show a high added benefit of the
V2X-enhanced braking systems compared to the exclusive use of visual-based
sensor systems for automated collision prevention.

Abstract: This paper presents a joint system modeling approach for fault simulation of
all-electric auxiliary power unit (APU), integrating starter/generator
turn-to-turn short circuit (TTSC) faults with gas generator gas-path faults.To
address challenges in electromechanical coupling, simulation precision and
computational efficiency balance, we propose a multi-rate continuous-discrete
hybrid simulation architecture. This architecture treats the starter/generator
as a continuous system with variable step size in Simulink, while modeling the
gas generator as a discrete system with fixed step size in a dynamic-link
library (DLL) environment. For the starter/generator fault modeling, a
multi-loop approach is deployed to accurately simulate TTSC faults. For the gas
generator, we develop an improved GasTurb-DLL modeling method (IGDM) that
enhances uncertainty modeling, state-space representation, and tool chain
compatibility. Finally, the proposed methodology above was implemented in a
case study based on the APS5000 all-electric APU structure and parameters.
Model validation was conducted by comparing simulation results--covering
steady-state, transients, healthy, and fault conditions--with reference data
from third-party software and literature. The close agreement confirms both the
model's accuracy and the effectiveness of our modeling methodology. This work
establishes a modeling foundation for investigating the opportunities and
challenges in fault detection and isolation (FDI) brought by the all
electrification of the APU, including joint fault estimation and diagnosis,
coupled electromechanical fault characteristics.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) for tracking is a recently introduced
approach, which extends standard MPC formulations by incorporating an
artificial reference as an additional optimization variable, in order to track
external and potentially time-varying references. In this work, we analyze the
performance of such an MPC for tracking scheme without a terminal cost and
terminal constraints. We derive a transient performance estimate, i.e. a bound
on the closed-loop performance over an arbitrary time interval, yielding
insights on how to select the scheme's parameters for performance. Furthermore,
we show that in the asymptotic case, where the prediction horizon and observed
time interval tend to infinity, the closed-loop solution of MPC for tracking
recovers the infinite horizon optimal solution.

Abstract: We propose a variant of the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star
(RRT$^{\star}$) algorithm to synthesize trajectories satisfying a given
spatio-temporal specification expressed in a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) for linear systems. Previous approaches for planning trajectories under
STL specifications using sampling-based methods leverage either mixed-integer
or non-smooth optimization techniques, with poor scalability in the horizon and
complexity of the task. We adopt instead a control-theoretic perspective on the
problem, based on the notion of set forward invariance. Specifically, from a
given STL task defined over polyhedral predicates, we develop a novel
algorithmic framework by which the task is efficiently encoded into a
time-varying set via linear programming, such that trajectories evolving within
the set also satisfy the task. Forward invariance properties of the resulting
set with respect to the system dynamics and input limitations are then proved
via non-smooth analysis. We then present a modified RRT$^{\star}$ algorithm to
synthesize asymptotically optimal and dynamically feasible trajectories
satisfying a given STL specification, by sampling a tree of trajectories within
the previously constructed time-varying set. We showcase two use cases of our
approach involving an autonomous inspection of the International Space Station

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to jointly optimize the base station (BS)
precoding matrix and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phases
simultaneously in a RIS-assisted multiple-user multiple-input-multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) scenario when the size of the RIS becomes extremely large. In this
paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm called sequential
multi-agent advantage actor-critic (A2C) to solve this problem. In addition,
the discrete phase of RISs, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and
channel correlations between users are taken into consideration. The
computational complexity is also analyzed, and the performance of the proposed
algorithm is compared with the zero-forcing (ZF) beamformer in terms of the sum
spectral efficiency (SE). It is noted that the computational complexity of the
proposed algorithm is lower than the benchmark, while the performance is better
than the benchmark. Throughout simulations, it is also found that the proposed
algorithm is robust to medium channel estimation error.

Abstract: This paper presents a scenario based robust optimization framework for short
term energy scheduling in electricity intensive industrial plants, explicitly
addressing uncertainty in planning decisions. The model is formulated as a
two-stage Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and integrates a hybrid scenario
generation method capable of representing uncertain inputs such as electricity
prices, renewable generation, and internal demand. A convex objective function
combining expected and worst case operational costs allows for tunable risk
aversion, enabling planners to balance economic performance and robustness. The
resulting schedule ensures feasibility across all scenarios and supports
coordinated use of industrial flexibility assets, including battery energy
storage and shiftable production. To isolate the effects of market volatility,
the framework is applied to a real world cement manufacturing case study
considering only day-ahead electricity price uncertainty, with all other inputs
treated deterministically. Results show improved resilience to forecast
deviations, reduced cost variability, and more consistent operations. The
proposed method offers a scalable and risk-aware approach for industrial
flexibility planning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Various domains such as power system stability analysis, electric machine
modeling, and control of power electronic converters have significantly
benefited from the application of coordinate transformations. One of the main
benefits is the dimensional reduction, which reduces the complexity of the
problems. This paper introduces a novel general transformation based on a
geometric framework that directly identifies the plane containing the locus for
unbalanced quantities through bivector analysis using Geometric Algebra. The
proposed method provides a direct transformation valid for any degree of
unbalance in $n$-phase, $(n+1)$-wire sinusoidal systems. The transformation
requires only two measurements (voltage or current) taken at different time
instants, making it computationally efficient. Moreover, we demonstrate through
pure geometric reasoning that our approach is general and encompasses other
techniques, such as the classical Clarke transformation. Numerical simulations
and experimental validation using a real-time digital simulator and a physical
laboratory setup demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This
generalization to multi-dimensional systems, combined with the reduced
measurement requirements, represents a significant advancement over existing
approaches that are typically restricted to three-phase applications or suffer
from computational limitations.

Abstract: Theory and methods to obtain parametric reduced-order models by moment
matching are presented. The definition of the parametric moment is introduced,
and methods (model-based and data-driven) for the approximation of the
parametric moment of linear and nonlinear parametric systems are proposed.
These approximations are exploited to construct families of parametric
reduced-order models that match the approximate parametric moment of the system
to be reduced and preserve key system properties such as asymptotic stability
and dissipativity. The use of the model reduction methods is illustrated by
means of a parametric benchmark model for the linear case and a large-scale
wind farm model for the nonlinear case. In the illustration, a comparison of
the proposed approximation methods is drawn and their advantages/disadvantages
are discussed.
