### [1] [Towards High-Precision Depth Sensing via Monocular-Aided iToF and RGB Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16579)
*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的iToF-RGB融合框架，通过几何校准和双编码器网络解决iToF深度传感的低分辨率、窄视场和结构失真问题，实现深度超分辨率和视场扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决间接飞行时间(iToF)深度传感技术的固有局限性，包括低空间分辨率、有限视场(FoV)以及在复杂场景中的结构失真问题。

Method: 首先通过精确的几何校准和对齐模块将窄视场iToF深度图重投影到宽视场RGB坐标系，确保模态间的像素级对应；然后使用双编码器融合网络从重投影的iToF深度和RGB图像中联合提取互补特征，并利用单目深度先验恢复精细结构细节和进行深度超分辨率。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在准确性、结构一致性和视觉质量方面显著优于最先进的方法，实现了增强的深度精度、改进的边缘锐度和无缝的视场扩展。

Conclusion: 提出的iToF-RGB融合框架通过跨模态结构线索和深度一致性约束，有效解决了iToF深度传感的局限性，为深度感知系统提供了高质量的深度重建解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

### [2] [CountLoop: Training-Free High-Instance Image Generation via Iterative Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16644)
*Anindya Mondal,Ayan Banerjee,Sauradip Nag,Josep Lladós,Xiatian Zhu,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountLoop是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过迭代结构化反馈为扩散模型提供精确的实例控制，在复杂高密度场景中实现高达98%的计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在逼真图像合成方面表现出色，但在生成具有精确对象实例数量的场景时仍然不可靠，特别是在复杂和高密度设置中。

Method: 采用训练免费框架，交替进行图像生成和多模态代理评估，包括语言引导的规划器和评论器来评估对象计数、空间布局和属性一致性。引入实例驱动的注意力掩码和组合生成技术来改善对象分离。

Result: 在COCO Count、T2I CompBench和两个新的高实例基准测试中，CountLoop实现了高达98%的计数准确性，同时保持空间保真度和视觉质量，以0.97的分数优于基于布局和梯度引导的基线方法。

Conclusion: CountLoop通过迭代结构化反馈有效解决了扩散模型在精确实例控制方面的局限性，为复杂场景生成提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

### [3] [A Lightweight Convolution and Vision Transformer integrated model with Multi-scale Self-attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16884)
*Yi Zhang,Lingxiao Wei,Bowei Zhang,Ziwei Liu,Kai Yi,Shu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEViT是一个轻量级视觉Transformer模型，通过稀疏注意力机制和卷积块结合，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT模型存在计算成本高、局部特征建模能力弱的问题，限制了在实际场景中的应用。需要平衡计算效率和性能。

Method: 提出SAA模块进行自适应稀疏采样，CIFFN层增强通道间信息交换，以及嵌入深度可分离卷积块的金字塔结构。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K分类任务上达到76.3%和79.6%的Top-1准确率，仅需0.8GFLOPs和1.3GFLOPs计算量。

Conclusion: SAEViT为各种基础视觉任务提供了一个高效的轻量级解决方案，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

### [4] [Do VLMs Have Bad Eyes? Diagnosing Compositional Failures via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16652)
*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Abha Jha,Mihir Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现CLIP视觉编码器中单个神经元同时表示多个特征（叠加现象），这阻碍了组合特征表示能力，导致视觉语言模型在组合推理和对象绑定方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，但在组合泛化和对象绑定方面存在困难，限制了处理新对象属性组合的能力。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析CLIP视觉编码器，发现MLP层中神经元存在特征叠加现象。

Result: 证明神经元叠加现象直接阻碍了组合特征表示，从而影响组合推理和对象绑定能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究为揭示视觉语言模型中组合失败机制根源迈出了第一步，相关代码和结果已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

### [5] [MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654)
*Chenghao Liu,Zhimu Zhou,Jiachen Zhang,Minghao Zhang,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNav是一个用于视觉语言导航的框架，通过集成记忆模块、空间模块和决策模块来解决现有方法的空间推理弱、跨模态接地差和长时任务内存过载问题，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单一大型语言模型的端到端视觉语言导航方法存在空间推理能力弱、跨模态接地差以及在长时任务中内存过载等关键漏洞，需要系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MSNav框架，包含三个协同模块：1）记忆模块-通过选择性节点剪枝的动态地图内存；2）空间模块-用于空间推理和对象关系推断；3）决策模块-基于LLM的路径规划。还开发了I-O-S数据集并微调Qwen3-4B模型为Qwen-Spatial。

Result: 在I-O-S测试集上，Qwen-Spatial在对象列表提取方面优于领先的商业LLM，获得更高的F1和NDCG分数。在R2R和REVERIE数据集上的广泛实验显示MSNav实现了最先进的性能，在成功率和路径长度加权成功率方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: MSNav通过将脆弱的推理转化为稳健的集成智能，有效解决了视觉语言导航中的关键挑战，为多模态导航任务提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Method: 采用卷积神经网络构建智能模型，使用鲸鱼优化算法和粒子群优化算法选择CNN超参数，通过Accuracy和F1指标评估系统性能

Result: 提出的方法在土壤类型多分类任务中取得了高效的结果

Conclusion: 结合CNN和群体智能算法能够有效提升土壤图像分类的性能，为土壤分类提供了有价值的解决方案

Abstract: Classifying soil images contributes to better land management, increased
agricultural output, and practical solutions for environmental issues. The
development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

### [7] [QA-VLM: Providing human-interpretable quality assessment for wire-feed laser additive manufacturing parts with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16661)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Joy Gockel,Michael B. Wakin,Craig Brice,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QA-VLM框架，利用视觉语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，结合领域专业知识，为增材制造提供可解释的质量评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统增材制造质量评估依赖人工经验，现有机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，限制了在实际应用中的可信度和采用率

Method: 开发QA-VLM框架，整合视觉语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，并从同行评审期刊文章中提炼应用特定知识

Result: 在24个激光线材直接能量沉积单珠样品上评估，相比现成VLM模型，在解释质量方面表现出更高的有效性和一致性

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力在增材制造应用中实现可信赖、可解释的质量评估

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

### [8] [The Loupe: A Plug-and-Play Attention Module for Amplifying Discriminative Features in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16663)
*Naren Sengodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了The Loupe，一种轻量级即插即用的注意力模块，可插入预训练Transformer中，通过复合损失函数引导模型关注最具判别性的物体部位，在提高细粒度视觉分类精度的同时提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类在生物多样性监测和医疗诊断等关键应用中至关重要，但现有Vision Transformer缺乏可解释性，难以在这些需要信任和验证的领域应用。

Method: 开发The Loupe注意力模块，可插入Swin Transformer等预训练骨干网络，使用复合损失函数进行端到端训练，无需部件级标注即可引导模型关注判别性特征。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上，将Swin-Base模型准确率从85.40%提升至88.06%，增益2.66%，注意力图能有效定位语义有意义的特征。

Conclusion: 简单的内在注意力机制可作为强大正则化器，显著提升性能的同时提供清晰的可视化解释，为理解和信任模型决策过程提供有价值工具。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

*Xiangxiang Wang,Xuanyu Wang,YiJia Luo,Yongbin Yu,Manping Fan,Jingtao Zhang,Liyong Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了双技术创新框架：跨模态差异化量化框架和场景感知向量化记忆多智能体系统，显著降低内存需求同时保持性能，为视障用户提供实时场景感知辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型内存需求大和视障辅助系统实时性不足的问题，旨在提高计算效率并为视障用户提供更全面的环境感知能力。

Method: 采用跨模态差异化量化框架减少模型内存占用，结合场景分类、向量化记忆和多模态交互的多智能体架构，通过感知-记忆-推理工作流实现历史记忆的高效存储和检索。

Result: 内存需求从38GB降至16GB，性能仅下降2.05%；在OCR-VQA上保持63.7准确率；响应延迟2.83-3.52秒，优于非流式方法；优于同等内存需求的较小模型。

Conclusion: 该研究在计算效率和辅助技术方面取得进展，为视障用户提供了实时场景感知、文本识别和导航的全面辅助解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes the dual technological innovation framework, including a
cross-modal differ entiated quantization framework for vision-language models
(VLMs) and a scene-aware vectorized
  memory multi-agent system for visually impaired assistance. The modular
framework was developed
  implementing differentiated processing strategies, effectively reducing
memory requirements from
  38GB to 16GB while maintaining model performance. The multi-agent
architecture combines
  scene classification, vectorized memory, and multimodal interaction, enabling
persistent storage
  and efficient retrieval of scene memories. Through
perception-memory-reasoning workflows, the
  system provides environmental information beyond the current view using
historical memories.
  Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05%
performance drop
  on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9),
outperforming smaller
  models with equivalent memory requirements like the Molmo-7B series. The
system maintains
  response latency between 2.83-3.52 seconds from scene analysis to initial
speech output, substantially
  faster than non-streaming methods. This research advances computational
efficiency and assistive
  technology, offering visually impaired users comprehensive real-time
assistance in scene perception,
  text recognition, and navigation.

### [10] [COVID19 Prediction Based On CT Scans Of Lungs Using DenseNet Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16670)
*Deborup Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络分析COVID-19患者的肺部CT扫描，预测感染严重程度（是否需要插管或导致死亡）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行导致全球医疗系统崩溃，呼吸系统衰竭是主要死因。传统医疗资源严重不足，需要自动化工具帮助医生快速评估病情严重程度

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)模型，基于患者确诊后一个月内的肺部CT扫描数据，训练模型识别感染严重程度

Result: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化诊断方法，能够通过CT扫描预测COVID-19感染的预后情况（是否需要插管治疗或可能导致死亡）

Conclusion: 机器学习模型可以减少人为错误，随着训练改进提供更高准确性，有望辅助医生在医疗资源紧张时快速评估COVID-19患者病情严重程度

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

### [11] [MedRepBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Medical Report Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16674)
*Fangxin Shang,Yuan Xia,Dalu Yang,Yahui Wang,Binglin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MedRepBench基准测试，包含1900份中文医疗报告，用于评估视觉语言模型在结构化医疗报告理解方面的性能，包括客观和主观评估协议，并通过GRPO优化提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗报告解读在医疗保健中至关重要，但目前缺乏标准化基准来评估结构化医疗报告理解的质量，特别是针对中文医疗报告。

Method: 构建包含1900份去标识化中文医疗报告的MedRepBench基准，支持两种评估协议：客观评估（测量结构化临床项目的字段级召回率）和自动化主观评估（使用LLM作为评分代理）。采用GRPO优化中等规模VLM。

Result: 通过GRPO优化使VLM获得了最高6%的召回率提升。OCR+LLM流水线虽然性能强劲，但存在布局盲区和延迟问题。

Conclusion: MedRepBench为结构化医疗报告理解提供了标准化评估基准，证明了VLM优化的有效性，同时揭示了纯文本方法的局限性，推动了基于视觉的报告理解技术的发展。

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

*Yanbing Bai,Rui-Yang Ju,Lemeng Zhao,Junjie Hu,Jianchao Bi,Erick Mas,Shunichi Koshimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级两阶段框架，用于无人机平台上的实时野火监测和火源检测，通过帧压缩和策略网络减少计算成本，同时保持检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无人机计算资源有限，无法独立运行大型模型进行实时视频分析，需要开发轻量高效的解决方案来实现实时野火监测。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用策略网络和帧压缩技术识别并丢弃冗余视频片段，引入站点机制利用未来帧信息提高准确性；第二阶段对分类为"火灾"的帧使用改进的YOLOv8模型进行火源定位。

Result: 实验结果显示，第一阶段在保持分类精度的同时显著降低计算成本，第二阶段相比基线方法在相似推理时间内获得更高的检测精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机平台提供了有效的实时野火监测解决方案，在计算效率和检测精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

*Abdul Rehman Akbar,Usama Sajjad,Ziyu Su,Wencheng Li,Fei Xing,Jimmy Ruiz,Wei Chen,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellEcoNet是一个基于空间感知深度学习的新框架，通过自然语言类比分析病理图像，将细胞视为单词、细胞邻域视为短语、组织结构视为句子，自动学习细胞间的上下文依赖关系来预测肺癌复发风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前约70%的侵袭性肺腺癌患者在术后5年内复发，现有工具无法准确识别需要辅助治疗的高风险患者，存在未满足的临床需求。

Method: 提出CellEcoNet框架，将整个切片图像建模为自然语言：细胞作为单词，细胞邻域作为短语，组织结构作为句子，通过深度学习自动学习这些上下文依赖的含义和空间相互作用。

Result: 在456个H&E染色切片数据集上，CellEcoNet达到AUC 77.8%和HR 9.54的预测性能，显著优于IASLC分级系统、AJCC分期和现有计算方法，并在不同人口统计学和临床亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet不仅提供了优越的预后预测能力，还通过解码肿瘤微环境的细胞"语言"，揭示了细微细胞变异如何编码复发风险，代表了病理学分析方法的范式转变。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用帕累托最优前沿评估文本到图像模型公平性和效用的方法，能够比较不同模型并找到最优超参数配置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型的公平性评估主要依赖定性判断或有限比较，缺乏可重复的评估方法，难以同时评估公平性和效用

Method: 使用帕累托最优前沿分析去偏方法的超参数化，采用归一化香农熵和ClipScore分别评估公平性和效用

Result: 评估了Stable Diffusion、Fair Diffusion、SDXL、DeCoDi和FLUX等模型，发现大多数默认超参数配置在公平性-效用空间中被支配，可以轻松找到更好的超参数

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种系统化、可重复的评估框架，能够有效比较不同文本到图像模型的公平性和效用表现

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

Motivation: 现有基准测试将这些网络任务分开处理，需要统一的评估框架来测试模型在复杂多步推理、精确元素定位和功能性UI理解编码方面的能力

Method: 使用专家标注的真实网络数据构建统一基准，评估三个核心任务：网站视觉问答、HTML/CSS/JavaScript代码编辑、原型到代码生成

Result: 多模态大语言模型在基础信息提取表现良好，但在推理定位、功能保持性代码编辑、支持多语言的层次化设计到代码生成方面存在困难

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs存在重要局限性，需要改进多模态和跨语言推理能力，以构建能够自动化多样化网络开发任务的未来网络代理

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

TL;DR: RoentGen-v2是一个文本到图像的扩散模型，用于生成胸部X光片，能够控制放射学发现和人口统计属性。通过合成数据预训练策略，显著提升下游疾病分类模型的性能、泛化能力和公平性。


<details>

Motivation: 解决医疗深度学习模型在临床部署中面临的性能鲁棒性和跨不同患者群体公平性的挑战，特别是在数据集规模和多样性有限的情况下。

Method: 开发RoentGen-v2文本到图像扩散模型，生成包含人口统计属性控制的合成胸部X光片。提出合成数据预训练策略：先用合成数据进行监督预训练，再用真实数据进行微调。

Result: 在5个机构的超过137,000张胸部X光片上评估，合成预训练使下游分类模型准确率提高6.5%，同时将诊断不足公平性差距减少19.3%。相比简单混合真实和合成数据的方法（仅提高2.7%）有显著改进。

Conclusion: 合成成像技术有潜力在真实世界数据约束下推进公平和可泛化的医疗深度学习，通过合成数据预训练策略可以同时提升模型性能和公平性。

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

Motivation: 现有3D物体检测方法受限于闭集假设，难以识别现实场景中的新物体及其属性，需要开发能够处理开放词汇场景的检测框架。

Method: 使用基础模型连接3D特征与文本语义，联合检测空间关系、运动状态等属性，包括基础模型特征拼接、提示调优策略、视角指定提示和水平翻转增强等技术。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上，在不提供新类别锚点尺寸的条件下，OVODA在开放词汇3D物体检测方面优于最先进方法，并成功识别物体属性。

Conclusion: OVODA框架有效解决了开放词汇3D检测问题，同时发布了包含全面属性标注的OVAD数据集，为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络(CNN)方法在天文图像处理中存在局限，需要开发更适合像素级比较的架构，同时避免计算昂贵的差异成像过程

Method: 采用Transformer架构的神经网络，直接分析搜索图像和模板图像，进行像素级详细比较，无需生成差异图像

Result: 在DES autoScan数据集上达到97.4%的分类准确率，随着训练集增大，差异图像的性能效用逐渐降低，网络在非中心化输入图像上也能保持相似性能

Conclusion: 该网络显著提高了超新星检测的准确性和效率，特别适用于大规模天文巡天项目，展示了Transformer架构在天文图像分析中的优势

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型需要多次迭代去噪步骤，限制了在需要高频控制的实际应用中的实用性

Method: 用归一化流(Normalizing Flow)替换扩散动作解码器，通过可逆变换实现单次采样

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，NinA与扩散模型性能相当，但推理速度大幅提升

Conclusion: NinA为高效高频VLA控制提供了有前景的路径，且不牺牲性能

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

Result: 相比现有辐射场方法，RF-PGS显著提高了重建精度，降低了训练成本，实现了无线信道的高效表示

Conclusion: RF-PGS为可扩展的6G空间CSI建模提供了实用解决方案，解决了传统方法和现有辐射场方法的局限性

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜图像配准面临挑战：大面积的同质区域和稀疏但关键的血管特征导致标准学习框架中梯度信号有限，难以实现精确配准。

Method: 提出高斯基元优化(GPO)框架：1) 初始粗配准后提取关键点作为描述符控制节点；2) 每个节点建模为可训练的高斯基元（位置、位移、半径）；3) 使用KNN高斯插值传播位移信号；4) 端到端多损失优化（关键点一致性和强度对齐）。

Result: 在FIRE数据集上，目标配准误差从6.2px降至~2.4px，25px处的AUC从0.770提升至0.938，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPO通过在高梯度区域战略性地锚定节点，确保鲁棒的梯度流，有效解决了纹理稀疏区域的梯度消失问题，为视网膜图像配准提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

Conclusion: 该研究填补了情感推理领域的空白，为多模态情感理解提供了新的评估标准和改进方向，有助于推动更自然的人机交互发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

TL;DR: Delta-SVD是一种无需训练的后处理压缩方法，通过SVD分解DreamBooth微调产生的权重增量，实现个性化扩散模型的高效压缩存储。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DreamBooth等个性化文本到图像模型需要微调大规模扩散主干网络，导致存储大量特定主题模型时产生显著存储开销。

Method: 利用权重增量具有强低秩结构的特点，首先应用奇异值分解(SVD)分解权重增量，然后采用基于能量的秩截断策略来平衡压缩效率和重建保真度。

Result: 在多主题数据集上的实验表明，Delta-SVD实现了显著压缩，在CLIP分数、SSIM和FID等生成质量指标上损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展和高效的个性化扩散模型部署，为需要存储和部署大规模主题定制化的实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Motivation: 理解视觉内容如何传达情感在社交媒体时代至关重要，但由于情感感知与复杂的场景级语义密切相关，这仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 提出MLLMsent框架，从三个角度研究MLLMs的情绪推理能力：(1)直接用于图像情感分类；(2)与预训练LLMs结合进行自动生成图像描述的情感分析；(3)在情感标注的图像描述上微调LLMs。

Result: 在基准测试中，微调方法取得了最先进的结果，分别比基于词典、CNN和Transformer的基线方法高出30.9%、64.8%和42.4%。在跨数据集测试中，无需在新数据上训练，仍比最佳竞争对手高出8.26%。

Conclusion: 结果突显了所提出的视觉推理方案在推进情感计算方面的潜力，同时为未来研究建立了新的基准。

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

TL;DR: AWM-Fuse是一种新颖的多模态图像融合方法，通过全局和局部文本感知处理恶劣天气条件下的多种退化问题，在统一共享权重架构中利用文本描述提升语义感知和图像融合质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在恶劣天气条件下的多模态图像融合中，虽然尝试引入文本信息来改善语义感知，但缺乏有效的文本内容分类和深入分析，需要更有效的方法来处理天气退化问题。

Method: 提出AWM-Fuse方法，包含全局特征感知模块（使用BLIP生成字幕提取整体场景特征和主要退化类型）和局部模块（使用ChatGPT生成详细场景描述关注具体退化效果），通过文本描述约束融合图像生成。

Result: 大量实验表明，AWM-Fuse在复杂天气条件和下游任务中优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过文本引导的网络学习过程，实现了更好的语义标签对齐，促进了更有意义的视觉特征学习，为恶劣天气条件下的多模态图像融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多维图像质量评估框架MDIQA，从技术和美学多个维度建模图像质量，并通过调整维度权重灵活应用于图像恢复任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法过度关注总体分数拟合，忽视了人类从多个维度评估图像质量的事实

Method: 构建包含5个技术维度和4个美学维度的多分支网络，每个分支单独训练特定维度特征，最后融合生成最终质量分数

Result: MDIQA在图像质量评估方面表现优异，并能有效灵活地应用于图像恢复任务

Conclusion: 多维图像质量评估框架能更好地模拟人类视觉感知，为图像恢复任务提供更灵活和用户导向的优化方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

*Qing Zhang,Jinguang Tong,Jie Hong,Jing Zhang,Xuesong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEGS是一个无需训练、即插即用的框架，通过定义结构能量并在采样时注入梯度来解决文本到3D生成中的Janus问题，显著改善多视角一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到3D生成存在Janus问题，即物体从正面看正确但从其他角度出现几何重复或扭曲，这源于2D扩散先验中的视角偏差。

Method: 提出结构能量引导采样(SEGS)，在U-Net中间特征的PCA子空间中定义结构能量，将梯度注入去噪轨迹，在采样时强制多视角一致性。

Result: SEGS显著减少了Janus伪影，实现了更好的几何对齐和视角一致性，无需重新训练或修改权重。

Conclusion: SEGS是一个有效的训练无关解决方案，能够改善文本到3D生成的几何质量和多视角一致性。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

### [29] [MSPCaps: A Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network with Cross-Agreement Routing for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16922)
*Yudong Hu,Yueju Han,Rui Sun,Jinke Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSPCaps是一个新颖的多尺度胶囊网络架构，通过多尺度特征提取、统一补丁化胶囊层和交叉一致性路由机制，有效解决了传统胶囊网络忽视多尺度特征和特征融合困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胶囊网络通常依赖单一高层特征图，忽略了多尺度特征的丰富互补信息，且传统特征融合策略难以协调多尺度特征差异，导致分类性能不佳。

Method: 提出MSPCaps架构，包含三个关键组件：多尺度ResNet骨干网络(MSRB)提取多尺度特征，补丁化胶囊层(PatchifyCaps)将多尺度特征统一划分为初级胶囊，交叉一致性路由(CAR)块通过识别最大一致性跨尺度预测对来自适应路由多尺度胶囊。

Result: MSPCaps在分类准确率方面持续超越多个基线方法，展现出卓越的可扩展性和鲁棒性，参数配置从高效的Tiny模型(344.3K参数)到强大的Large模型(10.9M参数)。

Conclusion: MSPCaps通过整合多尺度特征学习和高效胶囊路由，在特征表示学习方面具有显著潜力，为胶囊网络的多尺度特征融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CC-CMR是一个基于对比学习和跨模态对齐的框架，用于无钆对比剂的心肌病筛查，通过将电影CMR与LGE序列的潜在空间对齐，在电影CMR嵌入中编码纤维化特异性病理信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振(CMR)是心肌病诊断的金标准，但依赖钆对比剂和人工密集解读限制了其在人群规模筛查中的应用，需要开发无钆的高效筛查方法

Method: 提出对比学习和跨模态对齐框架，通过特征交互模块优化诊断精度和跨模态特征一致性，并采用不确定性引导的自适应训练机制动态校准任务特定目标

Result: 在多中心231名受试者数据上，CC-CMR达到0.943的准确率(95% CI: 0.886-0.986)，比最先进的仅电影CMR模型性能提升4.3%，同时消除了钆依赖性

Conclusion: CC-CMR展示了在广泛人群和医疗环境中进行无钆心肌病筛查的临床可行性，为大规模部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

*Qi Song,Ziyuan Luo,Ka Chun Cheung,Simon See,Renjie Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Invert3D是一个新颖的3D内容个性化框架，通过建立3D表示与文本嵌入空间的对齐，实现无需重新训练的自然语言驱动的3D内容个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D个性化方法主要依赖基于知识蒸馏的方法，需要计算成本高昂的重新训练过程。虽然视觉语言模型如CLIP能够通过对齐的视觉-文本嵌入空间实现直接图像个性化，但由于3D内容与2D图像之间的固有结构差异，这些技术无法直接应用于3D个性化。

Method: 开发相机条件的3D到文本逆向机制，将3D内容投影到与文本嵌入对齐的3D嵌入空间中。通过建立3D表示与文本嵌入空间的对齐，实现自然语言提示下的高效3D内容操作和个性化。

Result: 大量实验证明Invert3D能够有效实现3D内容的个性化，消除了计算密集的重新训练需求。

Conclusion: Invert3D通过创新的3D到文本嵌入对齐机制，为3D内容个性化提供了一个高效便捷的解决方案，填补了现有技术在3D领域应用的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our

Abstract: This work presents a novel deep learning framework for segmenting cerebral

approach utilizes a novel unsupervised domain adaptation methodology, using a

### [33] [NAT: Learning to Attack Neurons for Enhanced Adversarial Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16937)
*Krishna Kanth Nakka,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAT方法通过针对神经网络中的特定神经元进行攻击，而不是传统的层级攻击，显著提高了对抗性扰动的可迁移性，在跨模型和跨域设置中分别超过现有基线14%和4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在单个中间层最大化干净图像和对抗图像的嵌入分离，但往往过度关注少数相似概念的神经元，而忽略了层内其他神经元。NAT旨在通过神经元级别的攻击来更有效地破坏神经网络的核心单元。

Method: NAT（Neuron Attack for Transferability）方法从嵌入级分离转向更基础的神经元特异性方法，针对嵌入中的特定神经元进行攻击，通过训练生成器来最大化神经元级别的扰动效果。

Result: 在41个不同的ImageNet模型和9个细粒度模型上进行广泛实验，NAT在跨模型设置中超过现有基线14%以上，在跨域设置中超过4%。通过利用训练生成器的互补攻击能力，仅用10次查询就能获得令人印象深刻的欺骗率。

Conclusion: 针对单个神经元进行攻击能有效破坏神经网络的核心单元，为不同模型间的可迁移性提供共同基础，NAT方法在对抗性攻击的可迁移性方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: HieroAction是一个视觉语言模型，通过分步动作推理和分层策略学习，提供准确且可解释的人类动作评估，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只提供最终评分而缺乏解释性分析，限制了在体育、医疗和机器人等领域的实际应用。需要能够提供结构化评估和详细反馈的系统。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 分步动作推理 - 专门设计的思维链过程，从整体识别到子动作分析再到最终评分；2) 分层策略学习 - 强化学习策略，学习细粒度子动作动态并与高级动作质量对齐。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，证明了该方法能够提供准确且可解释的动作评估。

Conclusion: HieroAction通过结合分步推理和策略学习，实现了准确、结构化和可解释的人类动作评估，解决了现有方法缺乏解释性的问题。

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPD-Diff是一种基于扩散模型的区域自适应物理引导去雾方法，通过物理引导中间状态定位策略和雾感知去噪时间步预测器，有效处理密集和非均匀雾霾场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于扩散的去雾方法在密集和非均匀雾霾条件下存在生成条件不足和空间适应性差的问题，导致恢复效果不佳。

Method: 提出RPD-Diff模型，包含物理引导中间状态定位策略(PIST)和雾感知去噪时间步预测器(HADTP)，利用物理先验和传输图交叉注意力机制实现区域自适应去雾。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，RPD-Diff在挑战性的密集和非均匀雾霾场景中实现了最先进的性能，生成高质量无雾图像，具有优异的细节清晰度和色彩保真度。

Conclusion: RPD-Diff通过物理引导和区域自适应机制，有效解决了密集非均匀雾霾条件下的去雾挑战，为复杂雾霾场景下的视觉增强提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Obz AI是一个全面的软件生态系统，旨在为视觉AI系统提供最先进的解释性和可观测性，通过集成XAI技术、知识管理和监控框架来解决深度学习模型的黑盒问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在计算机视觉领域表现出色，但CNN和ViT等先进模型被视为黑盒，缺乏决策透明度。尽管XAI技术有所进展，但在实际CV部署中解释性仍未充分利用，主要障碍是缺乏将XAI技术与强大知识管理和监控框架集成的软件解决方案。

Method: 开发Obz AI生态系统，提供从Python客户端库到全栈分析仪表板的无缝集成管道。使机器学习工程师能够轻松整合先进XAI方法、提取分析特征进行异常检测，并实时持续监控AI模型。

Result: Obz AI使深度模型的决策机制变得可解释，促进了计算机视觉系统的可观测性和负责任部署。

Conclusion: Obz AI填补了XAI技术与实际CV部署之间的集成空白，为视觉AI系统提供了全面的解释性和监控解决方案，有助于推动负责任AI的发展。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack
analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily
incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes
observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的群体计数模型设计原则，强调模型的局部建模能力，并设计了LIMM模型，通过窗口划分和对比学习策略显著提升了高密度人群的计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考群体计数的本质特征：人群中的个体（人头）通常只占据图像的很小部分。现有方法使用与其他视觉任务相同的骨干网络并追求大感受野，而忽视了局部建模的重要性。

Method: 设计了LIMM模型，包含两个主要策略：1）对模型输入应用网格窗口划分设计；2）窗口级对比学习设计以增强模型区分局部密度水平的能力。模型末端还应用了全局注意力模块来处理偶尔出现的大尺寸个体。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提模型在局部建模能力方面有显著提升（例如在JHU-Crowd++高密度子集上MAE提升8.7%），同时不损害对大尺寸个体的计数能力，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 强调局部建模能力是群体计数任务的重要设计原则，LIMM模型通过创新的窗口划分和对比学习策略有效解决了高密度人群计数问题，为群体计数领域提供了新的思路和方法。

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了RDR框架来增强和评估多模态大语言模型在视觉退化科学图表上的鲁棒性，通过多视图一致性验证机制和新的评估指标来解决现有模型对噪声、模糊等常见视觉扰动的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理科学图表方面具有巨大潜力，但在实际部署中面临视觉扰动（如噪声、模糊、遮挡）的鲁棒性不足问题，现有评估基准未能充分探索这一挑战。

Method: 提出RDR框架，采用自适应多视图和一致性验证机制（AMCV），生成多个扰动版本的图表进行并行推理，并通过基于一致性的自校正循环。同时构建了SciDiagram-Robust数据集和两个新指标PRS和VDC。

Result: 实验表明即使是GPT-4V等最先进的闭源模型在面对扰动输入时性能显著下降（清洁准确率85.2% vs PRS 72.1%）。

Conclusion: RDR框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉退化科学图表上的鲁棒性，揭示了当前模型在真实世界科学文档处理中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于网格的3D仿真在复杂环境（如密集温室）中表现不佳，而现有的神经渲染方法虽然视觉逼真但缺乏集成基准标记的能力，而基准标记对机器人定位和控制至关重要。

Method: 开发了一种混合框架，将高斯泼溅(GS)的光真实感与结构化标记表示相结合，核心贡献是提出了一种新颖算法，能够在杂乱场景中高效生成基于GS的基准标记（如AprilTags）。

Conclusion: 该框架在具有密集植被、相似元素和遮挡的农业环境中表现出色，突显了其在现实世界应用中的价值，为移动机器人训练提供了高质量的3D仿真解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

Abstract: 3D mapping in dynamic environments poses a challenge for modern researchers
in robotics and autonomous transportation. There are no universal
representations for dynamic 3D scenes that incorporate multimodal data such as
images, point clouds, and text. This article takes a step toward solving this
problem. It proposes a taxonomy of methods for constructing multimodal 3D maps,
classifying contemporary approaches based on scene types and representations,
learning methods, and practical applications. Using this taxonomy, a brief
structured analysis of recent methods is provided. The article also describes
an original modular method called M3DMap, designed for object-aware
construction of multimodal 3D maps for both static and dynamic scenes. It
consists of several interconnected components: a neural multimodal object
segmentation and tracking module; an odometry estimation module, including
trainable algorithms; a module for 3D map construction and updating with
various implementations depending on the desired scene representation; and a
multimodal data retrieval module. The article highlights original
implementations of these modules and their advantages in solving various
practical tasks, from 3D object grounding to mobile manipulation. Additionally,
it presents theoretical propositions demonstrating the positive effect of using
multimodal data and modern foundational models in 3D mapping methods. Details

Motivation: 当前视觉语言大模型在复杂现实场景中表现出鲁棒性不足、容易产生幻觉和推理错误的问题，特别是在需要精确图像区域定位和细粒度视觉推理的任务中。

Method: 提出HCG-LVLM架构，采用两层处理：全局上下文感知层进行初步广泛理解，细粒度局部接地层包含局部细节增强模块提取高分辨率特征和语义一致性验证器确保准确的视觉语言对齐，通过自适应融合机制整合两层信息。

Conclusion: 分层设计有效增强了细粒度视觉语言理解和精确接地能力，验证了从粗到细认知处理方式在提升模型性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景流估计方法主要关注两帧输入，忽略了时序信息；而多帧方法随着帧数增加计算成本急剧上升。需要一种既能利用时序信息又计算高效的方法。

Method: 提出DeltaFlow框架：1) 使用Δ方案以最小计算成本提取时序特征；2) 引入类别平衡损失处理类别不平衡问题；3) 使用实例一致性损失确保物体运动一致性。

Conclusion: DeltaFlow通过高效的时序特征提取和针对性的损失函数设计，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了场景流估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/Kin-Zhang/DeltaFlow along with trained model

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented
reality (AR) that unifies semantic decomposition, Context-Aware SLAM Branches
(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR
enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease,
providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code
and dataset will be made open source.

Motivation: 解决全微调预训练视觉模型会损害其固有泛化能力的问题，参数高效适应策略通过选择性微调参数子集来平衡任务适应和泛化保持

Method: JPS方法限制只更新少量稀疏参数子集，使用双操作符选择机制识别在所有源域中具有一致显著梯度的参数进行更新

Result: 理论建立了考虑参数更新稀疏性的泛化误差界，实验证明JPS在领域泛化基准测试中优于最先进方法

Conclusion: JPS方法通过选择性参数更新有效保留了预训练模型的泛化能力，在效率和效果上都表现出色

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Motivation: 当前的点云注册方法在高离群比率下遍历空间和时间复杂度过高，或者因阶段分解而受到局部最优的影响。需要一种更高效、更准确的注册方法。

Method: 使用Chasles定理将刚体变换分解为沿旋转轴的平移和2D刚体变换。通过分支界限搜索最优旋转轴和角度，将剩余参数形成范围最大查询问题。具体包括：1）在半球参数化空间中搜索前k候选旋转轴；2）通过间隔刷新估计沿轴平移；3）使用扫描线算法解决2D范围最大查询问题。

Result: 在3DMatch、3DLoMatch和KITTI数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在准确性和效率方面都超过了当前最先进方法，时间复杂度为多项式，空间复杂度与点数成线性关系。

Conclusion: 该线性空间复杂度的几何最大重叠注册框架能够在保持高准确性的同时提高效率，解决了当前方法在高离群比率下的性能问题。

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

Conclusion: HiCache通过理论驱动的特征预测方法，为扩散模型提供了高效且高质量的推理加速解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

Conclusion: CPC通过利用大语言模型和对比学习，有效解决了弱监督语义分割中类间关系忽略和细粒度区分不足的问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流在线动作检测模型对视频视角变化敏感，在面对未见过的视频源时泛化能力受限，需要解决视角变化带来的挑战

Method: 提出概率时间掩码注意力模型PTMA，利用概率建模获得视频帧的潜在压缩表示，采用基于GRU的时间掩码注意力单元查询输入视频序列，并整合多视角信息提取视角不变特征

Result: 在DAHLIA、IKEA ASM和Breakfast数据集上，通过跨主体、跨视角和跨主体-视角三种评估协议，PTMA模型达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: PTMA模型通过概率建模和多视角信息整合，有效提升了在线动作检测在跨视图场景下的泛化能力和性能表现

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

### [55] [A Novel Local Focusing Mechanism for Deepfake Detection Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17029)
*Mingliang Li,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Changhong Liu,Hanxi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Local Focus Mechanism (LFM)方法，通过注意力机制关注局部伪造特征，解决现有深度伪造检测方法在跨类别和跨生成域泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建学习的深度伪造检测方法存在两个主要问题：1）在特定类别上训练的模型容易过拟合语义特征分布，难以泛化到其他类别；2）全局平均池化会丢失关键的局部伪造线索。需要开发更具泛化能力的检测方法。

Method: 提出局部聚焦机制(LFM)，集成显著性网络(SNet)和任务特定的Top-K池化(TKP)模块来选择K个最具信息量的局部模式。为防止过拟合，引入基于排名的线性丢弃(RBLD)和随机K采样(RKS)两种正则化技术。

Result: LFM在准确率上比最先进的NPR方法提升3.7%，平均精度提升2.8%，同时在单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU上保持1789 FPS的卓越效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨域深度伪造检测设立了新的基准，通过关注局部特征显著提升了检测性能的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Motivation: 数字食物内容的激增需要更精细的视觉理解和检索系统，特别是在饮食监测、智能厨房和餐厅自动化等应用中，食物图像-文本匹配是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出训练免费的视觉语言模型引导框架，包含：1）单向/双向多模态融合策略，结合图像嵌入和VLM生成的文本描述；2）基于特征的重排序机制，利用预测的食物成分来优化检索结果。

Result: 在密集和稀疏标注场景下，top-1检索分别提升约10%和7.7%，top-k成分级检索提升约28.6%。小模型通过文本融合可以匹配或超越大模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效的多模态特征融合和重排序策略，显著提升了食物图像-文本检索性能，且在资源受限环境下表现优异，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust
and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and
retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger
counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

networks to stylize faces in a specific style, even with limited style images.
Our approach leverages textual inversion and diffusion-based guided image
generation to augment small style datasets. By systematically generating
diverse style samples guided by both the original style images and real face
images, we significantly enhance the diversity of the style dataset. Using this
augmented dataset, we train fast image-to-image translation networks that
outperform diffusion-based methods in speed and quality. Experiments on
multiple styles demonstrate that our method improves stylization quality,
better preserves source image content, and significantly accelerates inference.
Additionally, we provide a systematic evaluation of the augmentation techniques
and their impact on stylization performance.

Conclusion: PVNet通过扩散模型和点-体素交互机制，有效解决了室外场景点云上采样问题，为3D场景理解提供了高质量的点云数据。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source

Conclusion: REGEN框架能够在保持高视觉质量的前提下实现实时照相实感增强，为游戏图形渲染提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are

TL;DR: SSG-DiT是一个新颖的可控视频生成框架，通过空间信号引导和两阶段解耦过程，显著提升了视频生成与文本描述的语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成模型在保持语义一致性方面存在困难，经常生成与提示细节不符的视频内容，需要解决这一关键挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）空间信号提示阶段利用预训练多模态模型生成空间感知视觉提示；2）通过轻量级SSG-Adapter将联合条件注入冻结的视频DiT主干，采用双分支注意力机制。

Result: 在VBench基准测试中达到最先进性能，在空间关系控制和整体一致性等关键指标上超越现有模型。

Conclusion: SSG-DiT框架通过空间信号引导和高效适配器设计，成功解决了可控视频生成中的语义一致性问题，为高质量视频合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将Vision Transformer与近端工具结合的新框架，通过几何优化方法增强特征表示和分类性能，解决了ViT只能建模局部关系而无法捕捉全局几何关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer虽然在计算机视觉领域取得了显著成功，但其优化仅限于建模单个图像内的局部关系，无法捕捉数据点之间的全局几何关系，这限制了其性能。

Method: 将ViT与近端工具集成，ViT通过自注意力机制构建流形的切丛（每个注意力头对应一个切空间），然后引入近端迭代来定义切丛中的截面并将数据从切空间投影到基空间，实现全局特征对齐和优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在分类准确率和数据分布方面优于传统ViT。

Conclusion: 该框架通过几何优化方法成功增强了ViT的特征表示能力，证明了整合几何工具对于提升视觉Transformer性能的有效性。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

TL;DR: PD-Loss结合代理基方法的计算效率和决策性指数的统计框架，解决了现有深度距离学习方法的样本复杂性、收敏慢或全局分布优化不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度距离学习方法存在多种限制：成对损失需要复杂的样本策略且收敏慢，代理基方法缺乏全局分布优化能力，而D-Loss又需要大批复样量导致计算成本高。

Method: 提出Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss)，通过可学习代理来估计真实和偶然分布，将代理基方法的高效计算与决策性指数(d')的统计分离性优化相结合。

Result: 在细粒度分类、人脸验证等多个任务上，PD-Loss达到了与最先进方法相当的性能，同时具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: PD-Loss为嵌入空间优化提供了一种新的视角，结合了计算效率和分布识别性优势，具有广阔的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

Conclusion: GRASP框架通过强化学习从弱标注中学习复杂的地理空间分割任务，显著降低了标注成本并提高了泛化性能，为遥感图像分析提供了新范式

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and
devices used on-farm

Conclusion: CE-RS-SBCIT框架通过整合局部细粒度和全局上下文信息，有效解决了脑肿瘤MRI分类中的挑战，表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Abstract: Natural disasters pose significant challenges to timely and accurate damage
assessment due to their sudden onset and the extensive areas they affect.
Traditional assessment methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and hazardous
to personnel, making them impractical for rapid response, especially in
resource-limited settings. This study proposes a novel, cost-effective
framework that leverages aerial drone footage, an advanced AI-based video
super-resolution model, Video Restoration Transformer (VRT), and Gemma3:27b, a
27 billion parameter Visual Language Model (VLM). This integrated system is
designed to improve low-resolution disaster footage, identify structural
damage, and classify buildings into four damage categories, ranging from
no/slight damage to total destruction, along with associated risk levels. The
methodology was validated using pre- and post-event drone imagery from the 2023
Turkey earthquakes (courtesy of The Guardian) and satellite data from the 2013
Moore Tornado (xBD dataset). The framework achieved a classification accuracy
of 84.5%, demonstrating its ability to provide highly accurate results.
Furthermore, the system's accessibility allows non-technical users to perform
preliminary analyses, thereby improving the responsiveness and efficiency of
disaster management efforts.

Abstract: Traditional video-based learning remains passive, offering limited
opportunities for users to engage dynamically with content. While current
AI-powered tools offer transcription and summarization, they lack real-time,
region-specific interaction capabilities. This paper introduces Untwist, an
AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to
ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box,
receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with
Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video
content to enhance comprehension. Our approach addresses GPT-4o spatial
weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.
This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing
and real-time interaction, and outlines how Untwist can transform passive video
consumption into an interactive, AI-driven learning experience with the
potential to enhance engagement and comprehension.

Motivation: 内侧额叶是阴杀病最早受影响的区域，但T2杀催MRI的各异向性分辨率导致直觉层厚度提取困难，影响阴杀病诊断和跟踪。

Method: 采用隐式神经网络表示方法，结合T1杀催和T2杀催MRI的分辨率优势，将各异向性地图集向各同性空间进行高精度重構，建立多模态高分辨率地图集。

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

TL;DR: 提出AdvCP方法解决弱监督变化检测中的背景噪声问题，通过对抗性提示挖掘和样本校正来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督变化检测仅依赖图像级标签，容易将背景变化误判为目标变化，特别是在复杂遥感场景中

Method: AdvCP包含两个阶段：对抗性提示挖掘（使用错误标签激活错误特征映射）和对抗性样本校正（构建在线全局原型整合样本）

Result: 在ConvNet、Transformer和SAM基线上均取得显著性能提升，且可推广到其他多类弱监督密集预测场景

Conclusion: AdvCP能有效解决弱监督变化检测中的共现噪声问题，无需增加推理成本，具有良好通用性

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is

Conclusion: 多模态伪标注方法能够有效构建高质量的封面图像生成数据集，为同时生成文本摘要和视觉图像的任务提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

Conclusion: FVP框架能够有效提升各种3D表示的性能，为机器人学习提供了强大的4D视觉预训练解决方案，并可扩展到更大的视觉-语言-动作模型

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

TL;DR: PersPose是一个新的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过引入透视编码(PE)和透视旋转(PR)来解决裁剪图像中相机内参缺失和透视失真的问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法仅使用裁剪图像作为输入，但缺少相机内参信息导致无法准确估计关节的相对深度。同时，人体偏离图像中心会导致透视失真，增加模型拟合难度。

Method: 提出PersPose框架：1) 透视编码(PE)编码裁剪图像的相机内参；2) 透视旋转(PR)将人体主体居中，减少透视失真；3) 结合PE和PR构建完整的3D姿态估计框架。

Result: 在3DPW、MPI-INF-3DHP和Human3.6M数据集上达到SOTA性能。在3DPW数据集上MPJPE为60.1mm，比之前SOTA方法降低7.54%。

Conclusion: PersPose通过显式编码相机内参和减少透视失真，显著提升了单目3D人体姿态估计的准确性，特别是在野外环境下的性能表现。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型处理图像时产生大量视觉token，导致计算成本高和内存开销大。现有剪枝方法在浅层缺乏足够上下文信息而效果不佳，但许多视觉token在浅层就存在固有冗余

Method: 提出CoViPAL方法，使用即插即用剪枝模块(PPM)在LVLM处理前预测和移除冗余视觉token。PPM轻量级、模型无关，可无缝集成到各种模型中

Conclusion: CoViPAL为提升LVLM推理效率提供了可扩展的高效解决方案，在不影响准确性的前提下显著降低计算成本

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

Method: 提出对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式，在微调过程中显式模拟MEA场景，并引入韧性驱动的损失函数来学习稀疏且稳定的水印表示，而不需要修改网络架构。

Result: 大量实验表明，AIS训练范式显著增强了各种现有方法对MEA的鲁棒性，能够保持二次嵌入后正确提取原始水印的能力。

Conclusion: AIS是一种即插即用的通用训练方法，有效解决了多嵌入攻击对深度伪造主动取证系统的威胁，提升了水印技术的实际应用可靠性。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ICPNet网络，通过模拟视觉皮层机制和多尺度特征处理，显著提升了深度神经网络对错觉轮廓的感知能力，使其更接近人类视觉认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度神经网络在真实任务中表现优异，但在感知错觉轮廓（如abutting grating）方面与人类感知模式存在差异，需要解决这种对齐问题以实现更高水平的机器智能。

Method: 设计ICPNet网络，包含多尺度特征投影模块(MFP)提取多尺度表征，特征交互注意力模块(FIAM)促进前馈和反馈特征交互，边缘融合模块(EFM)通过边缘检测任务注入形状约束。

Result: 在AG-MNIST和AG-Fashion-MNIST测试集上，ICPNet对错觉轮廓的敏感性显著优于现有最优模型，各项子集的top-1准确率均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作朝着基于DNN的模型实现人类水平智能迈出了一步，通过模拟人类视觉机制成功提升了网络对错觉轮廓的感知能力。

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

TL;DR: 提出AdaGAT方法，通过动态调整指导模型的训练状态来增强目标模型的对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗蒸馏方法使用可学习的指导模型时，由于指导模型从零开始学习，难以在协同训练中保持最优状态进行有效知识迁移

Method: 开发AdaGAT方法，包含两个独立的损失函数，使指导模型更积极地参与反向传播以达到最优状态

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上评估，使用WideResNet-34-10作为目标模型，相比多种基线模型在各种对抗攻击下显著提升了目标模型的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 适当调整指导模型在特定精度范围内可以增强目标模型的对抗鲁棒性

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects.
It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content

object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module.
Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID
evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The

detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction
recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌少症与不良手术结果相关，传统CT图像骨骼肌面积测量耗时且增加临床工作量，需要更高效可扩展的自动化解决方案

Method: 采用迁移学习和自监督学习方法，使用标记和未标记的CT扫描数据集开发深度学习模型，进行定量骨骼肌面积测量

Result: 模型预测骨骼肌面积平均误差±3个百分点，预测掩模的平均Dice相似系数为93%，表明高度准确的自动化测量

Conclusion: 该方法为肌少症评估和检测的全自动化提供了可行途径，解决了类别不平衡和数据有限的问题，定量评估比定性检测更精确有效

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

Result: 在三个RGB-T基准测试中取得了令人满意的结果，同时达到实时速度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模态感知和Transformer融合有效提升了RGB-T跟踪性能，在精度和速度方面都表现出色。

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

TL;DR: FoundDiff是一个基础扩散模型，通过两阶段策略（剂量-解剖感知和自适应去噪）实现跨不同剂量水平和解剖区域的统一低剂量CT去噪，在泛化性和性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FoundDiff作为一个基础扩散模型，能够统一且可泛化地处理不同剂量水平和解剖区域的低剂量CT去噪任务，为临床应用提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

Conclusion: 在语义分割技术趋于成熟的背景下，针对具体应用场景的特定问题进行分析并设计相应的解决方案比通用的模型改进更为有效，特别是在处理类不平衡和细粒度结构时。

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光谱提升方法只能将RGB图像转换为光谱图像，而SpecGen旨在从单张RGB球体图像生成光谱双向反射分布函数(BRDF)，实现任意光照和形状下的光谱图像渲染。

Method: 提出Spectral-Spatial Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA)网络，建模波长和入射-出射方向的反射响应，利用丰富的RGB BRDF数据训练策略来增强光谱BRDF生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法从有限光谱数据中准确重建光谱BRDF，在高光谱图像重建方面超越最先进方法，PSNR提升8dB。

Conclusion: SpecGen方法成功解决了光谱BRDF数据稀缺的问题，实现了从RGB图像到光谱BRDF的有效生成，为光谱图像渲染提供了新途径。

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models
(LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured
tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated
scorecard images from ODI, T20, and Test formats, accompanied by 1,500 English
QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English
scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi
scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled
cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical
data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results
show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and
exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key
limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning,
and cross-lingual generalization. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging
Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DIALab/MMCricBench, to promote LVLM

TL;DR: HiDA-Net是一个高分辨率细节聚合网络，通过特征聚合模块融合全分辨率局部瓦片和下采样全局视图，解决了现有检测方法在高分辨率AI生成图像检测中的信息丢失问题，在多个数据集上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测方法通常基于低分辨率自动生成数据集训练，无法应对高分辨率场景的复杂性。常见的图像调整策略（如调整大小或中心裁剪）会导致输入信息丢失，无法捕捉细微的高频伪影。

Method: 提出HiDA-Net框架，使用特征聚合模块（FAM）融合多个全分辨率局部瓦片和下采样全局视图的特征。引入Token-wise Forgery Localization（TFL）模块增强空间敏感性，以及JPEG质量因子估计（QFE）模块显式分离生成伪影和压缩噪声。还构建了HiRes-50K新基准数据集。

Conclusion: HiDA-Net通过确保不遗漏任何像素的细节聚合方法，有效解决了高分辨率AI生成图像检测的挑战，为未来研究提供了新的基准和解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon
dataset and 10% on our HiRes-50K.

TL;DR: DiCache是一种无需训练的自适应缓存策略，通过浅层在线探针实时分析扩散模型特征差异，动态决定缓存时机和利用多步缓存，显著提升扩散模型加速效果和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的扩散模型加速方法依赖预定义经验法则或数据集先验，在高度动态的扩散过程中泛化性有限，对异常样本效果不佳。研究发现浅层特征差异变化模式与最终输出存在强相关性，不同层特征形成相似轨迹。

Method: DiCache包含两个核心组件：1) 在线探针分析方案 - 通过浅层在线探针实时获取缓存误差稳定先验，自主决定缓存时机；2) 动态缓存轨迹对齐 - 基于浅层探针特征轨迹组合多步缓存，更好近似当前特征。

Result: 在WAN 2.1、HunyuanVideo视频生成和Flux图像生成等多种领先扩散模型上的大量实验证明，DiCache相比最先进方法能实现更高效率和改进的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: DiCache提供了一个统一的框架来解决"何时缓存"和"如何使用缓存"两个基本问题，无需训练即可自适应加速扩散模型，在运行时表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

TL;DR: 提出UniGen统一图像生成框架，通过CoMoE模块解决多条件生成中的参数冗余问题，使用WeaveNet桥接全局文本控制与细粒度条件控制，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成方法为每种条件类型训练独立控制分支，导致模型结构冗余和计算资源低效使用，需要统一的框架来支持多样化条件输入并提升生成效率。

Method: 提出Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE)模块聚合语义相似的patch特征并分配给专用专家模块，以及WeaveNet动态连接机制实现主干网络与条件分支的有效交互。

Conclusion: UniGen框架通过统一的架构设计有效解决了多条件图像生成中的参数冗余和计算效率问题，在通用性和有效性方面都具有显著优势。

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Result: MoCo在生成真实且结构连贯的人类视频方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦结构和外观生成，结合新的控制模块和大规模全身视频数据集，有效解决了文本到人类视频生成中的运动一致性问题

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic
and structurally coherent human videos.

Motivation: 解决SAM在医学图像分割中的三个关键问题：贝叶斯微调不稳定性、高计算成本、黑盒设计缺乏可解释性，以满足临床安全关键应用的需求。

Method: 提出T-VBI将SAM输出token重新参数化为潜在变量进行无训练变分贝叶斯推理，结合SO-KAN使用可学习样条激活函数通过自监督学习提升token预测和可解释性。

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM统一了效率、可靠性和可解释性，将SAM的多功能性与临床需求连接，推动在安全关键医学应用中的部署。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair

efforts are focused into identifying and studying this phenomenon. We
characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%

*Zihan Liang,Jiahao Sun,Haoran Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefineEdit-Agent是一个无需训练的多模态智能代理框架，通过结合LLM的规划能力和LVLM的视觉理解能力，实现复杂、迭代、上下文感知的图像编辑，在LongBench-T2I-Edit基准上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在细粒度迭代编辑方面存在局限，包括指令理解粒度不足、修改过程中的上下文保持问题以及缺乏智能反馈机制。

Method: 提出RefineEdit-Agent框架，包含LVLM驱动的指令解析和场景理解模块、多级LLM驱动的编辑规划器、迭代图像编辑模块以及LVLM驱动的反馈评估循环，形成闭环系统。

Result: 在提出的LongBench-T2I-Edit基准（500张初始图像，9个视觉维度的多轮编辑指令）上，RefineEdit-Agent平均得分3.67，显著优于Direct Re-Prompting(2.29)、InstructPix2Pix(2.91)、GLIGEN-based Edit(3.16)和ControlNet-XL(3.39)。

Conclusion: 消融实验、人工评估和分析验证了该智能代理设计在编辑保真度和上下文保持方面的有效性，为复杂迭代图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

*Qitong Zhang,Jieqing Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于显式网格表示的高效多视角表面重建方法，通过解耦几何与外观模型、神经变形场和新型正则化技术，在保持高效率的同时显著提升重建质量和应用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于神经渲染的多视角表面重建方法需要额外网格提取步骤、产生低质量表面（网格锯齿）的问题，限制了下游应用。

Method: 使用显式网格表示和可微分光栅化框架，构建解耦的几何与外观模型（不依赖深度网络），引入神经变形场整合全局几何上下文，采用新型正则化约束几何特征，分离视角无关的漫反射项并烘焙到网格顶点。

Result: 实现了最先进的训练速度（4.84分钟）和渲染速度（0.023秒），重建质量与顶级方法相当，支持网格和纹理编辑等实际应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率、质量和应用范围方面的优异表现，为多视角表面重建和渲染领域做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从视觉信息推断3D场景物理属性对创建交互式虚拟世界至关重要，但现有方法依赖缓慢的逐场景优化，限制了通用性和应用

Method: 训练通用神经网络从3D视觉特征预测物理属性，使用监督损失，结合高斯泼溅等静态场景表示，利用预训练视觉特征如CLIP

Result: PIXIE比测试时优化方法快1.46-4.39倍，速度快几个数量级，仅使用合成数据训练就能零样本泛化到真实世界场景

Conclusion: PIXIE提供了一种快速、通用的物理属性推断方法，通过收集大规模数据集PIXIEVERSE和利用预训练特征，实现了从合成数据到真实场景的有效迁移

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D物体检测研究主要在训练和测试集分布相同的有限数据集上进行，缺乏对跨数据集适应能力的考察。室内点云数据集因采集方式不同存在多种域差距问题。

Method: 构建了包含ScanNet、SUN RGB-D、3D Front及新提出的ProcTHOR-OD和ProcFront数据集的综合基准，设计了合成到真实、点云质量、布局和实例特征等多种适应场景的实验。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来开发具有更强跨域泛化能力的3D物体检测器提供了重要基准和指导，推动了室内场景理解技术的发展。

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂未修剪视频中难以捕捉细粒度动作、长期时间依赖和从低级视觉特征提取高级语义信息的局限性。

Method: 采用双分支设计：视频编码分支用于时空特征提取，跨模态引导分支利用LVLM生成全局事件提示和时间子事件提示等多粒度语义描述，通过自适应门控、跨模态注意力和事件图模块进行融合。

Result: 在ActivityNet v1.3上平均mAP达到40.5%，在THUMOS14上mAP@0.5达到67.1%，超越了领先的基线方法。

Conclusion: ECVT通过结合大型视觉语言模型的语义理解能力和先进的融合机制，显著提升了视频时序结构和事件逻辑的理解能力，在动作识别和定位任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

GraphMMP, which is based on graph neural networks. The proposed model
constructs feature graphs using mutual information and features a global fusion
module built on Mamba, which significantly boosts prognosis performance.
Empirical results show that GraphMMP surpasses existing methods on datasets
related to liver prognosis and the METABRIC study, demonstrating its
effectiveness in multimodal medical prognosis tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的敏感度感知正则化调优框架有效解决了多模态跟踪器微调中的可塑性-稳定性权衡问题，为跨模态适应提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

TL;DR: 结合DINO和Barlow Twins两种自监督学习方法，提出了一种在有限标签数据和计算资源下训练视觉Transformer的新方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自监督学习中DINO对数据增强敏感和Barlow Twins需要大批次尺寸的问题，利用两种方法的互补优势来降低对标注数据和计算资源的需求

Method: 将Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标与DINO的自蒸馏策略相结合，在MS COCO数据集上使用仅10%的标注数据进行线性探测训练

Result: 混合方法在损失和分类准确率上与DINO相当，同时保持了强大的特征表示能力，注意力可视化显示在语义分割能力方面有所提升

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下训练ViT提供了一种可扩展、标签高效的替代方案

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MRI工作流程分散且缺乏通用性，现有方法通常是特定解剖结构或应用的，且很少整合影像数据和临床语言信息。

Method: 采用多阶段训练范式：自监督视觉预训练、视觉-语言对齐、多模态预训练和多任务指令调优，使用来自60个公共数据集的22万MRI体积和1900万MRI切片的大规模数据。

Conclusion: OmniMRI有潜力将分散的流程整合为可扩展的通用框架，为统一影像和临床语言的端到端MRI解释奠定了基础。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

*Quanjian Song,Xinyu Wang,Donghao Zhou,Jingyu Lin,Cunjian Chen,Yue Ma,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERO是一个针对世界模型的无训练分层加速框架，通过浅层补丁刷新机制和深层线性外推方案，实现1.73倍加速且质量损失最小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成驱动世界模型因扩散模型的迭代特性导致推理缓慢，现有加速技术直接应用会导致质量下降，且世界模型的多模态特性存在特征耦合现象

Method: 分层加速策略：浅层使用补丁刷新机制选择需要重计算的token；深层使用线性外推方案直接估计中间特征，绕过注意力模块和前馈网络计算

Result: HERO实现了1.73倍加速，质量退化最小，显著优于现有扩散加速方法

Conclusion: HERO框架有效解决了世界模型推理效率问题，通过分层策略充分利用特征耦合特性，在保持质量的同时大幅提升推理速度

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Conclusion: TinyGiantVLM有效连接了视觉感知和空间理解，在复杂工业环境中展现出强大的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale
environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models
(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an
80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved
performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 开发一个不依赖物种的通用动物个体识别算法，解决现有方法在准确性和速度方面的局限性

Method: 提出两种基于关键点（热点）匹配的方法：1）顺序匹配查询图像与数据库图像；2）基于快速最近邻搜索的匹配，采用竞争性评分机制（源自Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor算法）

Result: 在包含1000多张图像的数据库上测试，比已发表方法更准确，每个查询图像只需几秒钟即可完成匹配

Conclusion: HotSpotter算法在动物个体识别任务中表现出优异的性能和通用性，为野生动物监测和保护提供了有效的技术工具

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

TL;DR: 提出基于加权Vision Transformer的多任务学习框架，联合预测ADAS-Cog总分及其13个子分数，通过子分数特异性损失加权提升预测准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog总分预测，忽视了13个子分数的预测价值，这些子分数反映不同认知领域，对总分确定具有不同影响

Method: 使用Vision Transformer作为特征提取器，构建多任务学习框架，系统研究子分数特异性损失加权对模型性能的影响

Result: 提出的加权策略具有群体依赖性：强加权对MRI模式更异质的MCI受试者效果更好，中等加权对变异度较低的CN受试者更有效

Conclusion: 统一加权未充分利用关键子分数并限制泛化能力，该框架为基于MRI的AD预后提供了灵活可解释的端到端学习方法

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿系统过度依赖人体掩码、对服装属性控制有限、在真实场景中泛化能力差，需要开发更先进的解决方案。

Conclusion: JCo-MVTON通过创新的多模态融合和数据集构建方法，成功解决了虚拟试穿系统的关键限制，为无需掩码的高质量虚拟试穿提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog总分预测，忽视了子项评分在特定认知领域衰退中的预测价值，且先前多任务学习研究未充分探索子项对总分的贡献机制。

Method: 采用Vision Transformer和Swin Transformer架构提取MRI影像特征，与纵向临床评分融合建模认知进展，构建多任务学习框架同时预测24个月时的总分和13个子项评分。

Result: 子项学习提高了总分预测精度，Q1(词语回忆)、Q4(延迟回忆)和Q8(词语识别)等少数子项主导总分预测，但这些关键子项预测误差较高，存在模型不稳定问题。

Conclusion: 研究证明了子项知情建模的价值，揭示了临床特征主导导致的不平衡学习问题，强调需要改进多模态融合和自适应损失加权来构建更可解释和临床稳健的AD预测框架。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Conclusion: 该研究为外部场景开放集分割提供了有效的新方法，结合了Mamba架构的优势和重构方法，在异常检测方面取得了显著成效

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over
wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this
data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,
large-scale pointclouds.

Conclusion: 该框架证明了在真实临床环境中应用的可行性，为非接触式、自动化的3D伤口评估提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

Motivation: 现有的少样本对象计数和检测方法将目标缩小为物体类别，无法有效定位非物体模式，且空间结构信息在原型表示中丢失。

Method: 重新实现经典模板匹配和回归方法，在冻结的背榜网络上添加少量可学习卷积或投影层，保留并利用示例的空间布局信息。

Conclusion: 经典模板匹配方法在少样本模式检测任务中仍然有效，通过简单的结构保留空间信息可以获得更好的检测性能。

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

TL;DR: DEHVF是一种基于动态嵌入和分层视觉特征融合的高效视觉语言微调方法，通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合与LLM各层语义粒度对应的分层特征，避免序列扩展问题

Motivation: 现有方法将视觉特征投影后与文本标记拼接会导致输入序列长度显著增加，造成大量计算开销。现有融合方法虽然缓解了序列长度问题，但往往忽略了模型内的分层语义表示和浅层视觉编码层中的细粒度视觉信息

Method: 通过轻量级分层视觉融合器，根据LLM各层的内部表示动态选择和融合对应语义粒度的分层特征，将融合后的层相关视觉特征投影对齐后直接嵌入到LLM相应层的FFN中

Result: 在各种VL基准测试中，包括ScienceQA的视觉问答和COCO Captions的图像描述，DEHVF比现有的参数高效微调基线实现了更高的准确性，同时保持了高效的训练和推理

Conclusion: DEHVF方法不仅避免了序列扩展，还动态融合了多层视觉信息，通过仅微调少量参数，实现了相同语义粒度下跨模态信息的精确对齐和互补

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

Result: HyTver获得了0.659的Dice分数，同时在距离度量指标上与其他流行损失函数表现相当，显示出良好的综合性能。

Conclusion: HyTver损失函数有效解决了多发性硬化症病变分割中的不平衡问题，在保持区域度量性能的同时改善了其他度量指标，为医学图像分割提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing
to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了M^3-GloDet框架，通过系统性评估不同检测模型在多类疾病肾球球检测中的性能，发现中等补丁大小和中等放大倍数能提高模型的效果和普通性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的计算机视觉检测算法主要集中在正常或全球硬化肾球球，对于广泛的疾病肾球球子类型研究较少。疾病变异的细微形态特征经常让进阶计算模型失效，且最佳成像放大倍数和视野范围的选择也存在争议。

Method: 提出M^3-GloDet系统框架，评估传统标准架构和最新的state-of-the-art模型，使用反映数字肾疾病理学中常见的不同关注区域大小和成像分辨率的实验设计。

Result: 发现中等补丁大小能提供上下文信息和效率的最佳平衡，中等放大倍数通过减少过拟合来提高模型的普通性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过系统性比较提供了对模型优势和局限性的深入理解，为数字病理学领域中自动检测策略和临床工作流的精炼提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

Result: 在三个公开医学数据集上的实验评估显示，该框架在OOD检测性能方面超过现有方法

Conclusion: 该研究提出的视觉-语言模型基于的OOD检测框架，通过层次视视融合和伪OOD样本生成，有效提升了医学图像中未知疾病的识别能力，为可靠医疗诊断系统提供了有力支持

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理长视频时面临注意力机制二次复杂度的计算挑战，需要一种既能保持性能又能显著降低计算开销的方法。

Method: 提出语言引导的时间令牌剪枝(LGTTP)框架，利用查询中的时间线索自适应地剪枝视频令牌，在时间相关段保留更高令牌密度，保持上下文连续性。

Result: 在TimeChat和LLaVA-Video上实现65%计算量减少，性能保持97-99%。QVHighlights上HIT@1提升9.5%，Charades-STA上R@1保持99.6%，在显式时间标记查询上表现优异。

Conclusion: LGTTP是一种模型无关的高效视频处理框架，在显著降低计算复杂度的同时保持近乎原始性能，特别适合处理长视频和理解时间相关查询。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided
Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to
adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing
computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP
retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our
model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a
65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original
performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on
Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit
temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding
tasks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

Motivation: 超分辨率技术需要提升低分辨率图像质量，现有方法在性能上仍有差距，需要整合Transformer、扩散模型和GAN的优势

Method: 采用双分支架构：主分支使用扩散启发的Transformer逐步细化潜在表示，辅助分支通过潜在对比增强噪声鲁棒性，最后使用残差密集块进行重建

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，CATformer在效率和视觉图像质量方面均优于最近的Transformer和扩散方法

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了Transformer、扩散和GAN方法之间的性能差距，为扩散启发式Transformer在超分辨率中的实际应用奠定了基础

Abstract: Super-resolution remains a promising technique to enhance the quality of
low-resolution images. This study introduces CATformer (Contrastive Adversarial
Transformer), a novel neural network integrating diffusion-inspired feature
refinement with adversarial and contrastive learning. CATformer employs a
dual-branch architecture combining a primary diffusion-inspired transformer,
which progressively refines latent representations, with an auxiliary
transformer branch designed to enhance robustness to noise through learned
latent contrasts. These complementary representations are fused and decoded
using deep Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for enhanced reconstruction
quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer
outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in
efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap
among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for
practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：神经渲染方法提供平滑几何但缺乏高频细节，模板重建方法使用顶点位移导致伪影，无法很好地处理动态服装的复杂变形

Method: 提出神经梯度变形方法(NGD)，结合自适应网格重划分策略处理动态表面演化(如褶皱)，并学习动态纹理贴图捕捉光照和阴影效果

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量评估，证明相比现有SOTA方法有显著改进，能够提供高质量的服装重建结果

Conclusion: NGD方法有效解决了动态服装重建中的几何细节和变形建模问题，为单目视频中的动态服装重建提供了高质量的解决方案

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

Motivation: 传统对话检索方法无法满足用户在长对话中寻找语义连贯的分散内容的需求，需要解决多模态长对话中的细粒度片段检索问题

Result: F2RVLM在领域内和真实场景下均优于主流视觉语言模型，展现出优异的检索性能

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多模态长对话细粒度检索的空白，提出的方法和模型能有效处理复杂的长对话检索需求

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于对话的生成和MLLM-扩散模型集成开辟了新可能性，实现了更细粒度的偏好覆盖和实时上下文感知图像生成

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Conclusion: 该框架为少样本人类动作异常检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，显著提高了训练效率和模型可扩展性

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

Motivation: 宫颈癌是全球女性癌症死亡的主要原因，传统Pap涂片人工检测耗时且易出错，需要自动化解决方案来提高早期诊断效率。

Method: 使用U-Net进行细胞分割，然后构建分类模型。在Herlev Pap Smear数据集上训练评估，比较分割图像与非分割图像对分类性能的影响。

Result: 分割图像仅带来轻微性能提升：精度提高约0.41%，F1分数提高约1.30%，表明分割对分类性能的影响有限。

Conclusion: 虽然分割有助于特征提取，但对分类性能提升作用有限。该框架可作为临床辅助工具，帮助病理学家进行早期诊断。

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文通过实证分析研究了CLIP预训练模型中的社会偏见如何传播到下游任务，发现偏见测量高度依赖于数据子集，预训练偏见与下游任务偏见之间缺乏一致的相关性，且不同CLIP模型在下游适应时表征空间趋于收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CLIP预训练模型被广泛用于下游任务，需要深入分析其迁移性影响，特别是这些模型记录在案的社会偏见和人类刻板印象如何传播到视觉问答、图像字幕等下游应用中。

Method: 通过全面的实证分析：1) 检查预训练偏见在数据全局和局部视图间的变化；2) 分析不同预训练偏见水平下预训练模型与下游任务偏见的相关性；3) 探索偏见不一致性的原因，研究当前范式下不同预训练CLIP模型在下游任务适应时的表征空间收敛情况。

Result: 研究发现：偏见测量高度依赖于计算所用的数据子集；预训练偏见与下游任务偏见之间难以发现一致的趋势；不同预训练CLIP模型在下游任务适应时表征空间趋于收敛，解释了偏见不一致性的原因。

Conclusion: 这项工作为偏见行为提供了有价值的见解，并为未来研究促进更好的偏见缓解实践提供了信息，表明当前需要更有效的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Conclusion: RAD框架对噪声训练条件具有卓越的鲁棒性，能够检测各种工业场景中的细微异常，是现实世界异常检测应用的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的细胞分割网络（如Cellpose、Stardist、HoverNet等）虽然准确度高，但需要完全标注的数据集，这限制了训练集的生成和迁移学习的应用。

Method: 提出了一种仍然基于距离图但能够处理部分标注对象的方法，该方法被嵌入到用户友好的Napari插件中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在节俭学习、迁移学习和常规学习场景下都能显著节省时间和资源，且不牺牲分割质量。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了完全标注数据集的限制，为细胞分割提供了更高效和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单有效的位置重加权视觉token剪枝方法，通过调整视觉token的空间位置注意力分数来缓解序列模型中的近因偏差问题，从而改善视觉语言模型的视觉token剪枝效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中视觉token数量远多于文本token，存在大量冗余。基于文本-视觉注意力分数的剪枝方法受到序列模型近因偏差的影响，导致图像底部区域的token获得过高注意力分数而被过度保留，造成次优剪枝。

Method: 提出位置重加权视觉token剪枝方法，根据视觉token在图像中的空间位置调整其注意力分数，这是一个即插即用的解决方案，无需改变模型架构或额外训练。

Result: 在LVLMs上的大量实验表明，该方法以最小的计算开销显著提升了视觉token剪枝的性能。

Conclusion: 该位置重加权机制有效缓解了近因偏差问题，为视觉语言模型的视觉token剪枝提供了一种简单而有效的改进方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

Conclusion: 该框架通过明确的时间建模和视觉-语义协作，有效解决了视频融合中的时间不一致问题，为视频融合领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is

Conclusion: 该框架消除了对视觉-语言对齐或模型集成的依赖，适用于资源受限环境中的快速部署，为工业和医疗异常检测提供了有效的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable

Conclusion: 该工作推进了场景生成领域的发展，为需要详细3D环境的应用开辟了新可能性，将发布代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Result: 在新建的RefTextCOD数据集上实验表明，该方法超越了之前的半监督方法，达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SCOUT方法通过有效利用未标注数据和文本信息，显著提升了半监督伪装目标检测的性能

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型具有出色的零样本泛化能力，但提示调优的泛化能力有限。标签平滑作为有效的正则化技术可以防止模型过度自信并提高泛化能力，但传统标签平滑反而会削弱提示调优的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ATLaS方法有效解决了标签平滑在提示调优中的负面效应，通过交替训练策略和高效软标签设计，显著提升了提示调优的泛化能力，且具有良好的兼容性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Conclusion: 通过类别均衡的样本选择和软假标签策略，能够有效提高目标检测器的训练效果，减少注释成本。

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: VISA方法有效解决了视觉令牌冗余问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升推理效率

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: GS-SMC框架提供了一种无需重新训练的高效位姿优化方案，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Conclusion: 该方法为静态图像和视频帧提供了一个轻量级、可解释且有效的解决方案，非常适合自动化内容验证和数字取证的实际应用

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for
real-world applications in automated content verification and digital
forensics.

Conclusion: ISALux通过有效整合光照和语义先验，在低光照图像增强任务中表现出色，各组件均对性能有重要贡献。

Abstract: We introduce ISALux, a novel transformer-based approach for Low-Light Image
Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors.
Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed
model. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: UniAPO成功解决了多模态自动提示优化的核心挑战，为多模态任务提供了稳定、目标驱动的优化框架，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长视频问答系统采用刚性流水线，将推理与感知解耦，导致信息丢失或计算效率低下。核心限制在于无法根据特定推理需求自适应地提取视觉信息。

Method: CAVIA引入三个创新：(1)分层推理引导的精确定位；(2)跨模态语义桥接进行目标提取；(3)置信度驱动的迭代合成，形成推理指导视觉提取的闭环系统。

Result: 在EgoSchema(65.7%, +5.3%)、NExT-QA(76.1%, +2.6%)和IntentQA(73.8%, +6.9%)等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 动态的推理-感知协调为视频理解提供了可扩展的范式，证明了自适应视觉注意力分配的重要性。

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

Result: PatchCoreCL表现有效，性能与任务特定模型相当，遗忘值小于1%。

Conclusion: 研究证明了持续学习在医学影像自适应视觉异常检测中的可行性和潜力。

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法不仅能高效扩展到大规模场景，还在相机姿态估计和新视角合成基准测试(TUM-RGBD、CO3Dv2、Tanks & Temples)上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SAIL-Recon通过结合神经场景表示和视觉定位能力，成功解决了大规模SfM问题，并在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Motivation: CAM是深度学习模型可视化的重要方法，但其对不同噪声的鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索。研究旨在评估各种CAM方法在不同噪声扰动下的弹性，分析噪声类型对CAM解释的影响。

Method: 通过分析不同噪声类型对CAM解释的影响，评估CAM对噪声的敏感性和数据集特征对解释稳定性的影响程度。提出了包含一致性和响应性两个维度的CAM鲁棒性度量指标。

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Conclusion: 该框架首次将2D X光片用于颅面重建，为法医鉴定提供了自动化、高效的解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

Motivation: 现有自回归文本到图像生成模型在处理多属性和模糊提示时能力有限，且大多数模型仅在生成阶段结束时提供奖励信号，这种单一的最后阶段指导难以识别哪些阶段对最终结果有积极贡献，可能导致次优策略。

Method: 提出Visual-Chain of Guidance (Visual-CoG)范式，包含三个阶段：语义推理、过程精炼和结果评估，通过阶段感知奖励在整个图像生成流程中提供即时指导。还构建了视觉认知基准VisCog-Bench来评估语义推理效果。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和提出的VisCog-Bench基准测试中分别实现了15%、5%和19%的性能提升，证明了Visual-CoG的优越性能。

Conclusion: Visual-CoG通过引入阶段感知奖励机制和多阶段指导范式，有效提升了文本到图像生成模型处理复杂提示的能力，为多阶段视觉合成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

TL;DR: EventTracer是一个基于路径追踪的渲染流水线，能够高效地从复杂3D场景模拟高保真事件序列，通过低SPP路径追踪加速渲染，并使用轻量级事件脉冲网络去噪生成逼真事件数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件流模拟方法通常使用无噪声RGB帧，渲染成本高且时间分辨率低（100-300 FPS），远低于真实事件数据。需要一种高效、物理感知的方法来生成大规模、高时间频率的事件数据。

Method: 采用低样本每像素（SPP）路径追踪加速渲染过程，训练轻量级事件脉冲网络（配备双极泄漏积分发射BiLIF单元）对RGB视频去噪生成事件序列，使用双向地球移动距离（EMD）损失进行训练。

Result: EventTracer流水线以约4分钟/秒720p视频的速度运行，保持了路径追踪的精确时空建模优势。在两个下游任务中显示比其他事件模拟器能捕获更好的场景细节，与真实事件数据相似度更高。

Conclusion: EventTracer是创建大规模事件-RGB数据集的有前景工具，能够以低成本缩小事件视觉的模拟-现实差距，促进机器人、自动驾驶、VR/AR等应用场景的发展。

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了开放集少样本HSI分类中未知类别的发现问题，为实际应用提供了更完整的解决方案

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as

both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments

comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image
editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical

hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GM-Skip是一个用于Transformer块跳过的灵活框架，通过度量引导的贪婪选择和反向删除机制，在保持输出质量的同时加速视觉语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型虽然性能出色，但计算成本高昂，阻碍了在延迟敏感应用（如自动驾驶）中的部署，需要一种既能加速推理又能保持性能的方法。

Method: 提出GM-Skip框架，采用度量引导的贪婪块选择策略，使用准确率、CIDEr等度量反馈识别冗余层，结合反向顺序删除机制保留早期基础块，并通过可调节的稀疏度-性能平衡目标支持不同部署需求。

Result: 在COCO和CODA等多个数据集上的实验显示，GM-Skip在保持任务性能的同时显著提升推理速度。在COCO数据集上，人物类别单目标分类准确率从19.1%提升至87.3%，同时跳过超过40%的Transformer块。在自动驾驶系统中实现45.4%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: GM-Skip通过智能的块跳过策略有效加速视觉语言模型推理，在保持性能的同时大幅降低延迟，验证了其在真实世界部署中的实用价值，特别适用于自动驾驶等延迟敏感应用场景。

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

TL;DR: SKD-CAG方法通过知识蒸馏和交叉注意力机制，选择性消除文本到图像扩散模型中后门攻击的影响，在保持图像质量的同时有效防御文本触发器的恶意操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型容易受到后门攻击，攻击者可以通过注入不可见的文本触发器来操纵模型输出。虽然分类模型中的文本后门防御已有研究，但生成模型缺乏有效的防御技术。

Method: 提出自知识蒸馏与交叉注意力引导(SKD-CAG)方法，利用知识蒸馏指导模型修正对中毒提示的响应，通过交叉注意力机制在注意力层面消除后门影响，同时保持模型在无触发器时的正常输出质量。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于现有方法，对像素后门的移除准确率达到100%，对基于风格攻击的移除准确率达到93%，且不牺牲模型的鲁棒性或图像保真度。

Conclusion: 目标性遗忘是一种有前景的防御策略，可以有效保护生成模型免受后门攻击，确保生成AI系统的安全性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: LanSE是一个新的评估框架，通过可解释的视觉模式和自然语言描述，为AI生成图像提供细粒度评估，包括提示匹配、视觉真实性、物理合理性和内容多样性四个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容的评估指标只能提供粗粒度评估，无法识别具体优缺点，限制了模型选择和科学理解。需要更细粒度的评估方法来支持模型开发和商业部署。

Method: 提出Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE)架构，识别可解释的视觉模式并用自然语言自动描述。通过大规模人工评估（超过11,000个标注）和多模态模型分析来验证。

Result: LanSE在自然图像中检测可解释视觉模式的准确率超过93%，能够揭示现有指标无法发现的模型细微差异，如FLUX的物理合理性优势和SDXL-medium的内容多样性优势，且与人类判断一致。

Conclusion: LanSE通过将可解释性与实际评估需求结合，为生成式AI用户提供了强大的模型选择、合成内容质量控制和模型改进工具，直接满足公众对AI生成内容的信心和安全需求。

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的基于Transformer的3D人体姿势采集器，能够在各种摄像机配置情况下将短序列2D关节点映射到3D姿势，运行速度快且准确性高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统3D姿势采集方法在无法获得完整摄像机参数和身体线段长度优先知识时性能下降的问题，以支持从完全配置实验室到野外单目视频的多种部署场景。

Method: 设计了一种包含掩码机制的轻量级Transformer模型，可以在训练和推理时忽略缺失的优先知识（摄像机参数和身体线段长度），使用AMASS数据集生成2D合成数据进行训练。

Result: 结果显示摄像机和线段长度优先知识都能提高性能，该多功能模型甚至在所有优先知识都可用时也超过专门模型，平均3D关节点位置估计准确度达到36mm，运行速度GPU上380微秒，CPU上1800微秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为单目3D姿势采集提供了一种高效、轻量级且适用范围广的解决方案，适合在嵌入式平台和低功耗设备上部署，在性能和效率方面都达到了独到的水平。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

Motivation: 针对3D高斯泼溅场景表示开发专门的视觉定位方法，利用显式3DGS表示实现准确相机定位，同时避免对场景模型的修改或额外训练需求。

Method: 通过下采样和编码3D高斯生成场景特征，编码图像块获取图像特征，采用三步算法：粗匹配、精匹配和姿态优化，最终获得精确的相机位姿估计。

Result: 在室内外场景的标准基准测试中表现出竞争性的定位性能，优于现有的3DGS基线方法，且能有效泛化到新场景而无需额外训练。

Conclusion: GSVisLoc成功证明了利用3DGS显式场景表示进行视觉定位的可行性，提供了一种高效且通用的定位解决方案，在保持性能的同时具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

TL;DR: 提出MMTok方法，利用视觉和文本token的多模态信息，通过最大覆盖准则选择信息丰富的视觉token，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用单模态信息进行视觉token剪枝，忽略了视觉-语言任务的多模态特性，且缺乏适用于不同模态的通用准则

Method: 将子集选择问题建模为最大覆盖问题，优化视觉token子集同时覆盖文本token和原始视觉token集，并使用VLM代理改进文本token质量来指导视觉剪枝

Result: 在POPE数据集上实现1.87倍加速同时保持98.7%原始性能；仅用4个视觉token仍保持LLaVA-1.5-7B 87.7%的原始性能

Conclusion: 视觉和文本信息具有互补性，多模态信息结合能显著超越单模态基线，覆盖准则在token选择中非常有效

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态模型在推理能力、效率和部署灵活性方面的挑战，开发一个更强大、更高效的开源多模态模型系列。

Method: 采用级联强化学习（Cascade RL）框架进行两阶段训练：离线RL确保稳定收敛，在线RL进行精细对齐；提出视觉分辨率路由器（ViR）动态调整视觉令牌分辨率；使用解耦视觉-语言部署（DvD）策略分离视觉编码器和语言模型到不同GPU。

Result: 在MMMU和MathVista等下游推理任务上取得显著改进，整体推理性能提升16.0%，推理速度加快4.05倍，支持GUI交互和具身代理等新能力，在开源MLLM中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: InternVL 3.5通过创新的训练框架和效率优化技术，显著提升了多模态模型的性能和效率，缩小了与商业模型的性能差距，为开源社区提供了强大的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code
are publicly released.

Motivation: 现有的3D修复方法依赖多视角2D图像修复，导致不同视角修复结果不一致，产生模糊纹理、空间不连续性和视觉伪影，影响3D对象补全的准确性和真实感。

Conclusion: ObjFiller-3D通过创新的视频模型适配方法有效解决了3D修复中的一致性问题，为高质量3D对象补全和编辑提供了有效的解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

*Christopher Liaw,Wennan Zhu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种改进的自动报价激励兼容性概念（RAIC和OAIC），解决了原有AIC定义过于严格的问题，并证明二价拍卖满足这两种新的激励兼容性条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动报价环境下存在多重均衡问题，原有的AIC定义过于严格且不允许广告主对约束报告有序数偏好。需要更精细地模型不同风险偏好的广告主的激励问题。

Method: 提出两种改进概念：避险型自动报价激励兼容性（RAIC）和乐观型自动报价激励兼容性（OAIC）。RAIC要求真实报告的最差均衡结果不比任何假报更差，OAIC则要求真实报告的最佳均衡结果不比任何假报更差。

Result: 证明二价拍卖（SPA）满足RAIC和OAIC条件。在两个广告主采用均匀报价策略的假设下，SPA仍然满足这些条件。

Conclusion: 新提出的RAIC和OAIC概念为自动报价环境中的激励兼容性分析提供了更精细的框架，并证明二价拍卖在这些改进定义下具有良好的激励性质。

Abstract: The rise of auto-bidding has created challenges for ensuring advertiser
incentive compatibility, particularly when advertisers delegate bidding to
agents with high-level constraints. One challenge in defining incentive
compatibility is the multiplicity of equilibria. After advertisers submit
reports, it is unclear what the result will be and one only has knowledge of a
range of possible results. Nevertheless, Alimohammadi et al. proposed a notion
of Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (AIC) which serves to highlight that
auctions may not incentivize truthful reporting of constraints. However, their
definition of AIC is very stringent as it requires that the worst-case outcome
of an advertiser's truthful report is at least as good as the best-case outcome
of any of the advertiser's possible deviations. Indeed, they show both
First-Price Auction and Second-Price Auction are not AIC. Moreover, the AIC
definition precludes having ordinal preferences on the possible constraints
that the advertiser can report.
  In this paper, we introduce two refined and relaxed concepts: Risk-Averse
Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (RAIC) and Optimistic Auto-bidding
Incentive Compatibility (OAIC). RAIC (OAIC) stipulates that truthful reporting
is preferred if its least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome is no worse than
the least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome from any misreport. This
distinction allows for a clearer modeling of ordinal preferences for
advertisers with differing attitudes towards equilibrium uncertainty. We
demonstrate that SPA satisfies both RAIC and OAIC. Furthermore, we show that
SPA also meets these conditions for two advertisers when they are assumed to
employ uniform bidding. These findings provide new insights into the incentive
properties of SPA in auto-bidding environments, particularly when considering
advertisers' perspectives on equilibrium selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着隐私增强技术的出现，用户主动避免数据跟踪，使得卖家转向社交网络进行用户画像。需要研究用户如何管理社交活动来应对个性化定价，以及卖家如何调整定价策略。

Method: 构建了一个非对称信息下的动态贝叶斯游戏模型，通过替代地进行向后和向前归纳来解决双重耦合挑战，并成功地得到了唯一的完美贝叶斯均衡解。

Result: 分析显示，随着画像技术的准确性提高，卖家会提高均一价格来激励用户增加社交活动，从而促进用户画像。但这导致大多数用户在知情同意政策实施后收益减少。

Conclusion: 这一发现表明，最近针对提高用户隐私意识的监管演进可能会导致用户收益减少的意外后果，需要重新考虑隐私保护政策的设计。

Abstract: Traditional user profiling techniques rely on browsing history or purchase
records to identify users' willingness to pay. This enables sellers to offer
personalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to
non-profiled users. However, the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies
has caused users to actively avoid on-site data tracking. Today, major online
sellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to
better track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper
presents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their
social activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller
should strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in
social networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller
and users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this
game comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well
as among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure
consistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under
random user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying
backward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique
perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as
the accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the
equilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and
facilitate user profiling. However, this results in most users being worse off
after the informed consent policy is imposed to ensure users' awareness of data
access and profiling practices by potential sellers. This finding suggests that
recent regulatory evolution towards enhancing users' privacy awareness may have
unintended consequences of reducing users' payoffs.

Conclusion: 该工作填补了排名聚合的公理化方法和统计方法之间的重要空白，为原则性的规则选择奠定了坚实的理论和计算基础。

Abstract: Given a set of items and a set of evaluators who all individually rank them,
how do we aggregate these evaluations into a single societal ranking? Work in
social choice and statistics has produced many aggregation methods for this
problem, each with its desirable properties, but also with its limitations.
Further, existing impossibility results rule out designing a single method that
achieves every property of interest. Faced with this trade-off between
incompatible desiderata, how do we decide which aggregation rule to use, i.e.,
what is a good rule picking rule?
  In this paper, we formally address this question by introducing a novel
framework for rule picking rules (RPRs). We then design a data-driven RPR that
identifies the best aggregation method for each specific setting, without
assuming any generative model. The principle behind our RPR is to pick the rule
which maximizes the consistency of the output ranking if the data collection
process were repeated. We introduce several consistency-related axioms for RPRs
and show that our method satisfies them, including those failed by a wide class
of natural RPRs. While we prove that the algorithmic problem of maximizing
consistency is computationally hard, we provide a sampling-based implementation
of our RPR that is efficient in practice. We run this implementation on known
statistical models and find that, when possible, our method selects the maximum
likelihood estimator of the data. Finally, we show that our RPR can be used in
many real-world settings to gain insights about how the rule currently being
used can be modified or replaced to substantially improve the consistency of
the process.
  Taken together, our work bridges an important gap between the axiomatic and
statistical approaches to rank aggregation, laying a robust theoretical and
computational foundation for principled rule picking.

Conclusion: 同时考虑时间和路线选择的决策模型能够更全面地解释群体形成机制，适用于鸟类迁徙、交通规划、灾难疏散等多种场景

Abstract: We present a Stackelberg game model to investigate how individuals make their
decisions on timing and route selection. Group formation can naturally result
from these decisions, but only when individuals arrive at the same time and
choose the same route. Although motivated by bird migration, our model applies
to scenarios such as traffic planning, disaster evacuation, and other animal
movements. Early arrivals secure better territories, while traveling together
enhances navigation accuracy, foraging efficiency, and energy efficiency.
Longer or more difficult migration routes reduce predation risks but increase
travel costs, such as higher elevations and scarce food resources. Our analysis
reveals a richer set of subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs) and heightened
competition, compared to earlier models focused only on timing. By
incorporating individual differences in travel costs, our model introduces a
"neutrality" state in addition to "cooperation" and "competition."

Abstract: We introduce a model for collaborative text aggregation in which an agent
community coauthors a document, modeled as an unordered collection of
paragraphs, using a dynamic mechanism: agents propose paragraphs and vote on
those suggested by others. We formalize the setting and explore its
realizations, concentrating on voting mechanisms that aggregate votes into a
single, dynamic document. We focus on two desiderata: the eventual stability of
the process and its expected social welfare. Following an impossibility result,
we describe several aggregation methods and report on agent-based simulations
that utilize natural language processing (NLP) and large-language models (LLMs)
to model agents and their contexts. Using these simulations, we demonstrate
promising results regarding the possibility of rapid convergence to a high
social welfare collaborative text.

### [201] [Price of Uncertainty for Consensus Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17557)
*Yunzhe Bai,Alec Sun*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了共识游戏中不确定性对社交成本的影响，证明了当不确定性扰动幅度为1+ε时，不确定性价格（price of uncertainty）的紧确界为Θ(ε²n²)，改进了之前的下界Ω(ε³n²)和上界O(εn²)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中玩家观察到的数据经常存在不确定性，而许多博弈论模型假设玩家拥有准确信息。本文旨在量化这种不确定性对社交成本的影响。

Method: 采用对抗性扰动模型，在玩家观察成本中引入相对幅度为1+ε的扰动，通过理论分析推导不确定性价格的界限。

Result: 证明了对于所有ε=Ω(n^{-1/4})的情况，共识游戏的不确定性价格紧确界为Θ(ε²n²)。

Conclusion: 该研究为共识游戏中不确定性影响提供了更精确的理论界限，表明不确定性价格随ε的平方和玩家数量n的平方增长。

Abstract: Many game-theoretic models assume that players have access to accurate
information, but uncertainty in observed data is frequently present in
real-world settings. In this paper, we consider a model of uncertainty where
adversarial perturbations of relative magnitude $1+\varepsilon$ are introduced
to players' observed costs. The effect of uncertainty on social cost is denoted
as the price of uncertainty. We prove a tight bound on the price of uncertainty
for consensus games of $\Theta(\varepsilon^2 n^2)$ for all $\varepsilon =
\Omega\mathopen{}\left(n^{-1/4}\right)$. This improves a previous lower bound
of $\Omega(\varepsilon^3 n^2)$ as well as a previous upper bound of
$O(\varepsilon n^2)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对手建模方法在非完美信息博弈中效果有限，即使面对来自已知先验分布的静态对手，也无法保证随着博弈次数的增加而收敛到对手的真实策略。

Method: 开发了一种基于序列形式博弈表示的凸最小化问题的新算法，使用投影梯度下降法高效求解，能够利用游戏观察数据和历史数据。

Conclusion: 提出的新算法解决了现有对手建模方法的局限性，为多智能体环境中的对手建模提供了理论保证和实际可行性。

Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward
against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic
solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in
some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and
observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent
modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal
opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such
approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show
that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable
property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution;
namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true
strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches
infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and
runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the
sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The
algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy
given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it
is available.

*Siddarth Srinivasan,Tao Lin,Connacher Murphy,Anish Thilagar,Yiling Chen,Ezra Karger*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: WOMAC是一种新的确定性竞赛机制，通过将专家评分基于同行预测的最佳聚合而非噪声结果，解决了标准竞赛设计中的激励兼容性和统计效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准竞赛设计存在两个主要问题：1）由于结果/标签中的噪声，较弱的竞争者可能偶然获胜；2）赢家通吃的性质激励专家为了获胜概率而误报预测，即使这会降低预期得分。现有随机机制虽然能实现激励兼容性，但增加了更多噪声且缺乏确定性。

Method: 提出WOMAC机制：不再基于噪声结果对专家评分，而是基于给定噪声结果下同行专家预测的最佳事后聚合来评分专家。提供了向量化高效实现和理论分析基础。

Result: 在真实世界预测数据集上的实证研究表明，WOMAC相对于标准机制能更可靠地预测专家的样本外表现，且在典型设置下比标准竞赛设计更高效。

Conclusion: WOMAC是一种有用的确定性竞赛机制，特别适用于结果/标签中存在显著噪声的竞赛场景，解决了标准设计的激励和效率问题。

Abstract: Competitions are widely used to identify top performers in judgmental
forecasting and machine learning, and the standard competition design ranks
competitors based on their cumulative scores against a set of realized outcomes
or held-out labels. However, this standard design is neither
incentive-compatible nor very statistically efficient. The main culprit is
noise in outcomes/labels that experts are scored against; it allows weaker
competitors to often win by chance, and the winner-take-all nature incentivizes
misreporting that improves win probability even if it decreases expected score.
Attempts to achieve incentive-compatibility rely on randomized mechanisms that
add even more noise in winner selection, but come at the cost of determinism
and practical adoption. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel
deterministic mechanism: WOMAC (Wisdom of the Most Accurate Crowd). Instead of
scoring experts against noisy outcomes, as is standard, WOMAC scores experts
against the best ex-post aggregate of peer experts' predictions given the noisy
outcomes. WOMAC is also more efficient than the standard competition design in
typical settings. While the increased complexity of WOMAC makes it challenging
to analyze incentives directly, we provide a clear theoretical foundation to
justify the mechanism. We also provide an efficient vectorized implementation
and demonstrate empirically on real-world forecasting datasets that WOMAC is a
more reliable predictor of experts' out-of-sample performance relative to the
standard mechanism. WOMAC is useful in any competition where there is
substantial noise in the outcomes/labels.

Method: 将MTD建模为部分可观测随机博弈，分析最优策略的阈值结构特性，提出结构感知策略梯度强化学习算法

Result: 通过数值模拟验证了所提方法的有效性，攻防双方能够收敛到纳什均衡

Conclusion: 基于博弈论和强化学习的结构感知方法能够有效提升移动目标防御的自适应能力和系统整体安全性

Abstract: In this work, we model Moving Target Defence (MTD) as a partially observable
stochastic game between an attacker and a defender. The attacker tries to
compromise the system through probing actions, while the defender minimizes the
risk by reimaging the system, balancing between performance cost and security
level. We demonstrate that the optimal strategies for both players follow a
threshold structure. Based on this insight, we propose a structure-aware policy
gradient reinforcement learning algorithm that helps both players converge to
the Nash equilibrium. This approach enhances the defender's ability to adapt
and effectively counter evolving threats, improving the overall security of the
system. Finally, we validate the proposed method through numerical simulations.

Motivation: 受学习型方法在生物生产领域应用的启发，需要解决不确定条件下的约束处理挑战

Method: 开发预测滤波器模块，以最小二乘法最小化修改控制器输出，确保约束在预测时域内得到满足，可与其他控制器结合使用

Result: 方法计算高效，适合实时应用，在单克隆抗体生物类似物生产的糖基化约束案例研究中验证有效性

Conclusion: 提出的模块化约束处理方法能有效处理模型不确定性和扰动下的软约束违反问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process
optimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in
learning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint
handling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler,
called predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a
constraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft
constraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be
combined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller
output, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within
the considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and
suitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is
illustrated through a realistic simulation case study of glycosylation
constraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production
using Chinese hamster ovary cells, for which the metabolic network model
consists of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基础性且可转移的方法，结合了社会、技术和经济因素，为加速脱碳和应对新的需求与生产模式带来的随机性挑战提供了解决方案

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the convergence of
transport electrification, creates a significant challenge for distribution
network management e.g. voltage and frequency violations, particularly in rural
and remote areas. This paper investigates how smart charging of electric
vehicles (EVs) can help reduce renewable energy curtailment and alleviate
stress on local distribution networks. We implement a customised AC Optimal
Power Flow (AC OPF) formulation which integrates into the optimisation an
indicator reflecting the social impact of flexibility from EV users, based on
the analysis of historical EV charging behaviours. The contribution of EV
owners to reducing wind curtailment is optimised to enhance the acceptability
of flexibility procurement, as the method targets EV users whose charging
habits are most likely to align with flexibility requirements. Our method
integrates social, technological, and economic perspectives with optimal
flexibility coordination, and utilises clustering of EVs through a kmeans
algorithm. To ensure scalability, we introduce a polar coordinate-based
dimension reduction technique. The flexibility optimisation approach is
demonstrated on the Orkney grid model, incorporating demand and wind farm
generation data, as well as multi year charging data from 106 EVs. Results
indicate that, by building upon the existing habits of EV users, curtailment
can be reduced by 99.5% during a typical summer week the period when
curtailment is most prevalent. This research demonstrates a foundational and
transferable approach which is cognisant of socio techno economic factors
towards accelerating decarbonisation and tackling the stochastic challenges of
new demand and generation patterns on local distribution networks.

Conclusion: 表后灵活性资源建模框架为解决低压配电网挑战提供了系统方法，但相关领域仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: The high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in low-voltage
distribution networks (LVDNs) often leads to network instability and
congestion. Discovering the flexibility potential of behind- the-meter (BTM)
assets offers a promising solution to these challenges, providing benefits for
both prosumers and grid operators. This review focuses on the objectives and
constraints associated with the operation of BTM flexibility resources in
LVDNs. We propose a new classification framework for network-aware flexibility
modelling that incorporates prosumer objectives, flexibility sources, and both
local and grid-level constraints. This review identifies research gaps in
prosumer-centric grid considerations, control strategies, flexibility
preferences, and scenarios in the use of BTM resources.

Motivation: 分布式发电的集成对能源转型至关重要，但对承载容量有限的低压配电网构成挑战，需要平衡效率与公平性。

Method: 将四种公平标准（功利主义、平等主义、有界公平和讨价还价公平）集成到承载容量优化框架中，应用于不同规模和拓扑结构的低压馈线进行分析。

Result: 讨价还价公平和上界公平在效率和公平性之间提供了最佳平衡。馈线拓扑显著影响公平性结果，而馈线规模影响总承载容量和固有公平性。

Conclusion: 监管激励和网络设计对于促进公平高效的分布式发电集成至关重要，需要根据馈线特性选择合适的公平标准。

Abstract: The integration of distributed generation (DG) is essential to the energy
transition but poses challenges for lowvoltage (LV) distribution networks (DNs)
with limited hosting capacity (HC). This study incorporates multiple fairness
criteria, utilitarian, egalitarian, bounded, and bargaining, into the HC
optimisation framework to assess their impact. When applied to LV feeders of
different sizes and topologies, the analysis shows that bargaining and
upper-bounded fairness provide the best balance between efficiency and
fairness. Efficiency refers to maximising the social welfare of the LV DNs,
while fairness is proportional to the minimisation of disparity in opportunity
for installing DG. Feeder topology significantly influences fairness outcomes,
while feeder size affects total HC and the inherent fairness of feeders. These
results emphasise the importance of regulatory incentives and network designs
in order to facilitate fair and efficient DG integration.

Conclusion: 该算法成功将一致性控制从欧几里得空间推广到李群流形，仅需配置信息即可实现多智能体协同，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, a consensus algorithm is proposed for interacting
multi-agents, which can be modeled as simple Mechanical Control Systems (MCS)
evolving on a general Lie group. The standard Laplacian flow consensus
algorithm for double integrator systems evolving on Euclidean spaces is
extended to a general Lie group. A tracking error function is defined on a
general smooth manifold for measuring the error between the configurations of
two interacting agents. The stability of the desired consensus equilibrium is
proved using a generalized version of Lyapunov theory and LaSalle's invariance
principle applicable for systems evolving on a smooth manifold. The proposed
consensus control input requires only the configuration information of the
neighboring agents and does not require their velocities and inertia tensors.
The design of tracking error function and consensus control inputs are
demonstrated through an application of attitude consensus problem for multiple
communicating rigid bodies. The consensus algorithm is numerically validated by
demonstrating the attitude consensus problem.

Conclusion: ChatMPC通过自然语言交互成功降低了控制个性化的使用门槛，为非专业用户提供了直观的控制系统个性化方案

Abstract: Traditional control personalization requires users to understand optimization
parameters and provide repetitive numerical feedback, creating significant
barriers for non-expert users. To deal with this issue, we propose ChatMPC, a
model predictive control framework that enables users to personalize control
systems and adapt to environmental changes through natural language
interaction. The framework operates in two modes: personalization, where users
iteratively adjust control behavior to their preferences, and co-development,
where users provide real-time environmental information that complements sensor
data. We establish convergence guarantees under different user behavior models,
demonstrating exponential convergence for consistent feedback and finite-time
convergence with logarithmic interaction complexity for tolerance-based users.
We validate ChatMPC through experiments in robot navigation with personalized
obstacle avoidance and semi-autonomous driving with conversational obstacle
reporting. Both experiments achieve real-time performance and demonstrate
effective adaptation to user preferences and environmental changes.

Method: 提出AEAT-AE框架：1）基于Transformer的自编码器，通过交叉注意力机制将环境参数整合到编码器和解码器中；2）集成深度Q网络（DQN）根据实时环境输入动态选择激活哪些Transformer层。

Result: 实验表明AEAT-AE在误码率方面优于传统方法，同时保持了高效的运行时间。

Conclusion: AEAT-AE为下一代UAV-FSO通信提供了一种新颖的定制化解决方案，有效平衡了性能和计算成本。

Abstract: The rise of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks sets high demands on
UAV-assisted Free Space Optical (FSO) communications, where the channel
environment becomes more complex and variable due to both atmospheric
turbulence and UAV-induced vibrations. These factors increase the challenge of
maintaining reliable communication and require adaptive processing methods.
Autoencoders are promising as they learn optimal encodings from channel data.
However, existing autoencoder designs are generic and lack the specific
adaptability and computational flexibility needed for UAV-FSO scenarios. To
address this, we propose AEAT-AE (Adaptive Environment-aware Transformer
Autoencoder), a Transformer-based framework that integrates environmental
parameters into both encoder and decoder via a cross-attention mechanism.
Moreover, AEAT-AE incorporates a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that dynamically selects
which layers of the Transformer autoencoder to activate based on real-time
environmental inputs, effectively balancing performance and computational cost.
Experiments demonstrate that AEAT-AE outperforms conventional methods in bit
error rate while maintaining efficient runtime, representing a novel tailored
solution for next-generation UAV-FSO communications.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种实用且可扩展的物理基础解决方案，能够在广泛的用户设备运动模型范围内有效工作，为RIS系统的实时性能提升提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Integrating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) into wireless
communication systems is a promising approach for enhancing coverage and data
rates by intelligently redirecting signals, through a process known as
beamforming. However, the process of RIS beamforming (or passive beamforming)
control is associated with multiple latency-inducing factors. As a result, by
the time the beamforming is effectively updated, the channel conditions may
have already changed. For example, the low update rate of localization systems
becomes a critical limitation, as a mobile UE's position may change
significantly between two consecutive measurements. To address this issue, this
work proposes a practical and scalable physics-based solution that is effective
across a wide range of UE movement models. Specifically, we propose a kinematic
observer and predictor to enable proactive RIS control. From low-rate position
estimates provided by a localizer, the kinematic observer infers the UE's speed
and acceleration. These motion parameters are then used by a predictor to
estimate the UE's future positions at a higher rate, allowing the RIS to adjust
promptly and compensate for inherent delays in both the RIS control and
localization systems. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, demonstrating real-time RIS adjustments with low
computational complexity, even in scenarios involving rapid UE movement.

Motivation: 现有小相位定理要求传递函数矩阵在特定频段满足扇区条件，这在某些频率范围内可能不成立，导致分析结果过于保守，无法准确分析异构多变换器电力系统的稳定性。

Method: 利用Davis-Wielandt(DW)壳进行分散式稳定性分析，开发几何分散稳定性条件，可视化显示异构变换器与电网的交互作用，实现模块化系统分析。

Conclusion: 基于DW壳的方法为异构多变换器电力系统的分散式稳定性分析提供了更有效和直观的工具，实现了模块化系统分析能力。

Abstract: The development of decentralized stability conditions has gained considerable
attention due to the need to analyze heterogeneous multi-converter power
systems. A recent advance is the application of the small-phase theorem, which
extends the passivity theory. However, it requires the transfer function matrix
to be sectorial, which may not hold in some frequency range and will result in
conservatism. This letter tackles this problem by leveraging the Davis-Wielandt
(DW) shells for decentralized stability analysis. We develop a geometric
decentralized stability condition that visually displays how heterogeneous
converters interact with the power grid and enable modular system analysis.

Abstract: This paper proposes a frequency-domain system identification method for
learning low-order systems. The identification problem is formulated as the
minimization of the l2 norm between the identified and measured frequency
responses, with the nuclear norm of the Loewner matrix serving as a
regularization term. This formulation results in an optimization problem that
can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We
derive an upper bound on the sampled-frequency complexity of the identification
process and subsequently extend this bound to characterize the identification
error over all frequencies. A detailed analysis of the sample complexity is
provided, along with a thorough interpretation of its terms and dependencies.
Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through an
example, along with numerical simulations validating the growth rate of the
sample complexity bound.

Motivation: 利用LEO卫星有限的空间和功率资源，通过ASIM技术提升卫星通信系统的频谱效率和能量效率，同时服务多用户和物联网设备。

Method: 采用主动堆叠智能超表面技术，结合速率分割多址接入(RSMA)和共生无线电网络，使用BCD-SCA、MA-CSAC和MCPPO三种优化算法进行系统优化。

Result: BCD-SCA在凸场景中快速稳定收敛，MCPPO初始收敛快但稳定性中等，MA-CSAC在大规模网络中实现最高的长期频谱和能量效率。ASIM优于主动RIS和对角线外RIS设计。

Conclusion: 多层ASIM与合适的优化算法相结合，为下一代LEO卫星通信提供了可扩展、高能效和高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication
system enhanced by an active stacked intelligent metasurface (ASIM), mounted on
the backplate of the satellite solar panels to efficiently utilize limited
onboard space and reduce the main satellite power amplifier requirements. The
system serves multiple ground users via rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)
and IoT devices through a symbiotic radio network. Multi-layer sequential
processing in the ASIM improves effective channel gains and suppresses
inter-user interference, outperforming active RIS and beyond-diagonal RIS
designs. Three optimization approaches are evaluated: block coordinate descent
with successive convex approximation (BCD-SCA), model-assisted multi-agent
constraint soft actor-critic (MA-CSAC), and multi-constraint proximal policy
optimization (MCPPO). Simulation results show that BCD-SCA converges fast and
stably in convex scenarios without learning, MCPPO achieves rapid initial
convergence with moderate stability, and MA-CSAC attains the highest long-term
spectral and energy efficiency in large-scale networks. Energy-spectral
efficiency trade-offs are analyzed for different ASIM elements, satellite
antennas, and transmit power. Overall, the study demonstrates that integrating
multi-layer ASIM with suitable optimization algorithms offers a scalable,
energy-efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation LEO
satellite communications.

Conclusion: R-CBF框架能够有效处理状态不确定性，为安全关键控制系统提供更强的鲁棒安全保障

Abstract: Safety-critical control is a crucial aspect of modern systems, and Control
Barrier Functions (CBFs) have gained popularity as the framework of choice for
ensuring safety. However, implementing a CBF requires exact knowledge of the
true state, a requirement that is often violated in real-world applications
where only noisy or estimated state information is available. This paper
introduces the notion of Robust Control Barrier Functions (R-CBF) for ensuring
safety under such state uncertainty without requiring prior knowledge of the
magnitude of uncertainty. We formally characterize the class of robustifying
terms that ensure robust closed-loop safety and show how a robustly safe
controller can be constructed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach through simulations and compare it to existing methods, highlighting
the additional robustness and convergence guarantees it provides.

Abstract: In this article we present a framework for direct data-driven control for
general problems involving interconnections of dynamical systems. We first
develop a method to determine the solution of a Sylvester equation from data.
Such solution is used to describe a subspace that plays a role in a large
variety of problems. We then provide an error analysis of the impact that noise
has on this solution. This is a crucial contribution because, thanks to the
interconnection approach developed throughout the article, we are able to track
how the noise propagates at each stage, and thereby provide bounds on the final
designs. Among the many potential problems that can be solved with this
framework, we focus on three representatives: cascade stabilisation, model
order reduction, and output regulation. This manuscript studies the first
problem, while the companion Part II addresses the other two. For each of these
settings we show how the problems can be recast in our framework. In the
context of cascade stabilisation, we consider the 2-cascade problem, the effect
of noise through the cascade, as well as N-cascade case, and we demonstrate
that our proposed method is data efficient. The proposed designs are
illustrated by means of a numerical example.

control-theoretic problems: model order reduction and output regulation. For
the model order reduction problem we provide a solution from input-state

noise. For the output regulation problem, we provide data-driven solutions for
the static and dynamic feedback problem. The proposed designs are illustrated

TL;DR: 提出基于电路的单面板光伏阵列模型，比传统聚合单二极管模型更准确，在部分遮荫和热点场景下功率输出估算精度分别提高21.2%和8.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前光伏系统采用聚合单二极管模型(SDM)表示光伏阵列，但该高度抽象模型难以准确捕捉部分遮荫和热点等实际工况，而光伏系统对电网运行的重要性要求更精确的建模。

Method: 开发基于电路的逐面板光伏阵列模型，为每个面板使用单二极管模型并将其互连形成阵列，在单电池物理和控制依赖的系统级行为之间建立平衡。建立与聚合单二极管阵列模型的数学等效条件，并使用真实光伏面板参数进行仿真验证。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的逐面板阵列模型能更准确地表示非理想条件下(如部分遮荫)阵列的电行为。在最大功率点跟踪控制下，部分遮荫场景下功率输出估算精度提高21.2%，热点场景下提高8.1%。

Conclusion: 逐面板光伏阵列模型相比传统聚合模型能更准确地模拟实际运行条件，为高渗透率光伏系统的电网运行提供更可靠的建模工具。

Abstract: Solar photovoltaic systems are increasing in size and number on the grid. In
regions with high penetration, such as California, PV systems serve multiple
functions, including peak shaving and demand response. Therefore, the
criticality of PV systems to grid operations calls for accurate models. The
current practice is to represent the PV array, composed of multiple PV panels,
with an aggregated single-diode model (SDM). The highly abstract model has a
limited ability to capture real-world behaviors, such as partial shading and
hotspots. Thus, we develop a circuit-based per-panel PV array model that uses a
single diode model for each panel and interconnects them to form an array. This
approach bridges the tradeoff between cell-level physics and control-dependent
system-level behavior. We establish conditions for mathematical equivalence
between the proposed per-panel array circuit model and the aggregated
single-diode array model. We generate empirical evidence by running simulations
using parameters derived from real-world PV panels. Results indicate that the
proposed per-panel array model can represent the electrical behavior of the
array under non-ideal conditions, such as partial shading, more accurately.
With maximum power point tracking control, the proposed model is 21.2% more
accurate when estimating the real power output of an array under a partial
shading scenario and 8.1% more accurate under a hot spot scenario.

Motivation: 开发真正的自主微机器人需要解决能量获取、传感、控制和驱动等多功能集成在有限空间内的技术挑战，传统方法难以在毫米尺度实现这些功能的整合

Method: 采用高密度异质集成技术，通过软基板微倒装芯片键合将定制CMOS和LED微芯片集成到可折叠聚合物表面，兼容卷绕式环境光收集。在立方体多个面上制造电解气泡驱动器，连接到传感器控制的片上微芯片

Conclusion: 这种新型集成方法为制造真正自主的毫米级微机器人提供了可行方案，实现了环境光供能、自主传感和程序化控制的多功能集成

Abstract: True microrobots, in contrast with externally controlled microparticles, must
harvest or carry their own source of energy, as well as their own (preferably
programmable) microcontroller of actuators for locomotion, using information
acquired from their own sensors. Building on recent published work [1], we
demonstrate here, for the first time, that microrobotic smartlets, hitherto
buoyancy divers, can also be equipped to navigate in 2D on surfaces, with
on-board control responding to both sensor information and their internal
electronic program. Fabricating modular microrobots, with all dimensions of 1mm
and below, has been difficult to achieve because of competing demands for the
limited surface area and the challenges of integrating and interconnecting the
diverse functionalities of energy harvesting, actuation, sensing,
communication, docking and control. A novel high density heterogeneous
integration, via soft-substrate micro flip-chip bonding of custom CMOS and LED
microchiplets onto fold-up polymer surfaces, compatible with roll-up isotropic
ambient light harvesting, now makes this possible. Fabricating electrolytic
bubble actuators on multiple cube-faces and connecting them to a custom
sensor-controlled on-board microchiplet (lablet), allows the smartlets to
locomote on wet surfaces, changing direction in response to both timed
programmed control as well as programmed response to locally sensed signals.
Such locomoted robotic microcubes can also move to and selectively dock with
other modules via patterned surfaces. This is powered by ambient light in
natural aqueous media on smooth surfaces.

Conclusion: 仿真验证了所提方法的有效性和正确性，为未知网络物理系统的传感器选择提供了实用的数据驱动解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of input-output data-driven sensor
selection for unknown cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular, out of a
large set of sensors available for use, we choose a subset of them that
maximizes a metric of observability of the CPS. The considered observability
metric is related to the $\mathcal{H}_2$ system norm, which quantifies the
average output energy of the selected sensors over a finite or an infinite
horizon. However, its computation inherently requires knowledge of the unknown
matrices of the system, so we draw connections from the reinforcement learning
literature and design an input-output data-driven algorithm to compute it in a
model-free manner. We then use the derived data-driven metric expression to
choose the best sensors of the system in polynomial time, effectively obtaining
a provably convergent model-free sensor selection process. Additionally, we
show how the proposed data-driven approach can be exploited to select sensors
that optimize volumetric measures of observability, while also noting its
applicability to the dual problem of actuator selection. Simulations are
performed to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: 提出的协调波束成形和控制方法有效解决了移动干扰中的精确协调问题，在保证友方通信安全的同时最大化对窃听者的干扰效果

Abstract: Efficient mobile jamming against eavesdroppers in wireless networks
necessitates accurate coordination between mobility and antenna beamforming. We
study the coordinated beamforming and control problem for a UAV that carries
two omnidirectional antennas, and which uses them to jam an eavesdropper while
leaving a friendly client unaffected. The UAV can shape its jamming beampattern
by controlling its position, its antennas' orientation, and the phases of the
antennas' interference signals. We derive a closed-form expression for the
antennas' phases that guarantees zero jamming impact on the client. In
addition, we determine the antennas' orientation and the UAV's position that
maximizes jamming impact on the eavesdropper through an optimal control
problem, optimizing the orientation pointwise and the position through the
UAV's control input. Simulations show how this coordinated beamforming and
control scheme enables directional GPS denial while guaranteeing zero
interference towards a friendly direction.

Abstract: Forced Oscillations (FO) stemming from external periodic disturbances
threaten power system security and stability. The increasing penetration of
Inverter-Based Resources(IBRs) further introduces FO, leading to new challenges
in identifying and locating FO sources in modern power systems. In this paper,
a novel data-driven method for locating FO in power systems with IBRs is
proposed. Unlike previous works, a unified representation of FO originating
from IBRs is considered, which further facilitates the development of the FO
locating algorithm. Leveraging on Sparse Identification for a Nonlinear
Dynamical (SINDy), a purely data-driven methodology is developed for locating
the source of FO by interpreting the proposed model from measurements.
Numerical results on the WECC 240-bus system validate the performance of the
proposed approach in successfully locating FO in the presence of IBRs.

Motivation: 解决传统黑盒方法在具有复杂耦合和快速动力学的四旋翼系统中面临的挑战，利用悬停点线性化模型的稀疏特性来简化参数识别。

Method: 使用递归最小二乘法(RLS)在线识别模型参数，仅识别与非线性耦合和动力学相关的关键参数，减少估计参数数量，并消除传统级联控制中对姿态设定点的需求。

Result: 该方法减少了参数估计数量，加速了识别过程，提高了瞬态稳定性，同时在动态环境中表现出良好的适应性。

Conclusion: PCAC策略为四旋翼控制提供了一种有效的自适应解决方案，通过利用模型稀疏性和在线参数识别，在保持控制性能的同时简化了控制结构。

Abstract: This paper presents a centralized predictive cost adaptive control (PCAC)
strategy for the position and attitude control of quadrotors. PCAC is an
optimal, prediction-based control method that uses recursive least squares
(RLS) to identify model parameters online, enabling adaptability in dynamic
environments. Addressing challenges with black-box approaches in systems with
complex couplings and fast dynamics, this study leverages the unique sparsity
of quadrotor models linearized around hover points. By identifying only
essential parameters related to nonlinear couplings and dynamics, this approach
reduces the number of parameters to estimate, accelerates identification, and
enhances stability during transients. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme
removes the need for an attitude setpoint, typically required in conventional
cascaded control designs.

Motivation: 研究在不对称信息条件下，逃避者是否可以通过欺骗性速度选择策略来延长被捕获时间，这是对经典追逃游戏的重要扩展。

Method: 首先推导了完全信息情况下的最优反馈纳什均衡策略，然后对不对称信息版本，表征了逃避者无法从欺骗策略中获益的初始位置区域，最后通过数值模拟验证欺骗策略的有效区域。

Result: 确定了逃避者无法从欺骗策略获益的初始位置区域，并提供了数值证据显示在某些游戏空间区域中，逃避者可以通过欺骗性移动显著增加捕获时间。

Conclusion: 不对称信息为逃避者提供了利用欺骗策略延长游戏时间的可能性，这在某些初始配置下特别有效，为追逃游戏理论提供了新的见解。

Abstract: The classic Homicidal Chauffeur game is a pursuit-evasion game played in an
unbounded planar environment between a pursuer constrained to move with fixed
speed on curves with bounded curvature, and a slower evader with fixed speed
but with simple kinematics. We introduce a new variant of this game with
asymmetric information in which the evader has the ability to choose its speed
among a finite set of choices that is unknown to the pursuer a priori.
Therefore the pursuer is required to estimate the evader's maximum speed based
on the observations so far. This formulation leads to the question of whether
the evader can exploit this asymmetry by moving deceptively by first picking a
slower speed to move with and then switching to a faster speed when a specified
relative configuration is attained to increase the capture time as compared to
moving with the maximum speed at all times. Our contributions are as follows.
First, we derive optimal feedback Nash equilibrium strategies for the complete
information case of this game in which the evader is allowed to vary its speed
in a given interval. Second, for the version with asymmetric information, we
characterize regions of initial player locations in the game space from which
the evader does not have any advantage in using deceptive strategies. Finally,
we provide numerical evidence of regions in the game space from which the
evader can increase the capture time by moving deceptively.

Abstract: This paper proposes a quality-of-service (QoS)-aware multi-user communication
framework facilitated by multiple simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). The user groups are
established based on their QoS requirements specified by the minimum data rate,
which is provisioned by the optimized transmission and reflection
configurations of the STAR-RISs. Particularly, we formulate an optimization
problem to maximize the aggregate link rate across all users, under
group-specified rate requirements by jointly considering the transmit
beamforming and STAR-RIS configurations. Then, we employ the Lagrangian duality
with quadratic transformation to tackle the non-convexity of the objective. We
decompose the problem within a block coordinate descent framework, and the
subproblems are solved through convex approximation and iterated to approach
the optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method in enhancing the system sum rate with guaranteed QoS
performance for heterogeneous users, offering valuable insights for the
deployment of STAR-RISs in future QoS-aware wireless networks.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) have the potential to reduce grid stress through
smart charging strategies while simultaneously meeting user demand. This
requires accurate forecasts of key charging parameters, such as energy demand
and connection time. Although previous studies have made progress in this area,
they have overlooked the importance of dynamic training to capture recent
patterns and have excluded EV sessions with limited information, missing
potential opportunities to use these data. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a dual-model approach incorporating incremental learning with
six machine-learning models to predict EV charging session parameters. This
approach includes dynamic training updates, optimal features, and
hyperparameter set selection for each model to make it more robust and
inclusive. Using a data set of 170,000 measurements from the real world
electric vehicle session, week-long charging parameters were predicted over a
one-year period. The findings reveal a significant difference between workplace
and residential charging locations regarding connection duration
predictability, with workplace sessions being more predictable. The proposed
stacking ensemble learning method enhanced forecasting accuracy, improving R2
by 2.83% to 43.44% across all parameters and location settings. A comparison of
the two models reveals that incorporating user IDs as a feature, along with the
associated historical data, is the most significant factor influencing the
accuracy of the forecast. Forecasts can be used effectively in smart charging
and grid management applications by incorporating uncertainty quantification
techniques, allowing charge point operators to optimize charging schedules and
energy management.

Abstract: Developing a unified small-signal model for modern, large-scale power systems
that remains accurate across a wide range of operating ranges presents a
formidable challenge. Traditional methods, spanning mechanistic modeling, modal
identification, and deep learning, have yet to fully overcome persistent
limitations in accuracy, universal applicability, and interpretability. In this
paper, a novel hierarchical neural state-space equation approach is proposed to
overcome these obstacles, achieving strong representation, high
interpretability, and superior adaptability to both system scale and varying
operating points. Specifically, we first introduce neural state-space equations
integrated with virtual state observers to accurately characterize the dynamics
of power system devices, even in the presence of unmeasurable states.
Subsequently, a hierarchical architecture is designed to handle the modeling
complexity across a wide range of operating conditions, flexibly decoupling
device and grid models to effectively mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
Finally, a set of spatiotemporal data transformations and a multi-stage
training strategy with a multi-objective loss function is employed to enhance
the models efficiency and generalization. Numerical results on the two-machine
three-bus system and the Guangdong Power Grid verify the superior performance
of the proposed method, presenting it as a powerful new tool for small-signal
stability analysis.

Method: 入侵威胁解决滚动时域问题最小化自身能量，同时避开拦截器和高斯屏障建模的静态致命区域；可消耗拦截器通过半径约束成本保持接近高价值资产，通过骚扰和围堵来拒绝攻击走廊，仅在几何可行性测试确认时进行拦截

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的对抗能量消耗防御策略，通过协调拦截器和静态防御区域来保护高价值资产免受机动威胁的攻击

Abstract: This paper presents a predictive framework for adversarial energy-depletion
defense against a maneuverable inbound threat (IT). The IT solves a
receding-horizon problem to minimize its own energy while reaching a high-value
asset (HVA) and avoiding interceptors and static lethal zones modeled by
Gaussian barriers. Expendable interceptors (EIs), coordinated by a central node
(CN), maintain proximity to the HVA and patrol centers via radius-based tether
costs, deny attack corridors by harassing and containing the IT, and commit to
intercept only when a geometric feasibility test is confirmed. No explicit
opponent-energy term is used, and the formulation is
optimization-implementable. No simulations are included.

Result: 证明了两阶段估计器具有强一致性和话法正态性，为这类估计器提供了首次理论保障

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the asymptotic properties of the Two-Stage (TS)
estimator -- a simulation-based parameter estimation method that constructs
estimators offline from synthetic data. While TS offers significant
computational advantages compared to standard approaches to estimation, its
statistical properties have not been previously analyzed in the literature.
Under simple assumptions, we establish that the TS estimator is strongly
consistent and asymptotically normal, providing the first theoretical
guarantees for this class of estimators.

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了切片殊殊动力学模型的控制问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升了计算效率

Abstract: Improving the predictive accuracy of a dynamics model is crucial to obtaining
good control performance and safety from Model Predictive Controllers (MPC).
One approach involves learning unmodelled (residual) dynamics, in addition to
nominal models derived from first principles. Varying residual models across an
environment manifest as modes of a piecewise residual (PWR) model that requires
a) identifying how modes are distributed across the environment and b) solving
a computationally intensive Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) problem for
control. We develop an iterative mapping algorithm capable of predicting
time-varying mode distributions. We then develop and solve two tractable
approximations of the MINLP to combine with the predictor in closed-loop to
solve the overall control problem. In simulation, we first demonstrate how the
approximations improve performance by 4-18% in comparison to the MINLP while
achieving significantly lower computation times (upto 250x faster). We then
demonstrate how the proposed mapping algorithm incrementally improves
controller performance (upto 3x) over multiple iterations of a trajectory
tracking control task even when the mode distributions change over time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算规模扩张已接近电网容量极限，需要新的能源解决方案来支持AI数据中心的发展，同时应对能源消耗带来的环境挑战。

Method: 采用离网AI方法，结合本地可再生能源发电和储能系统，为AI数据中心供电，从离网开始构建完整的能源解决方案。

Result: 提出了离网AI数据中心的可行性框架，指出了该方法在技术、社会和项目层面的挑战，但具有巨大的潜在价值。

Conclusion: 需要系统开发者和AI数据中心运营商的先驱者共同努力，快速将离网AI方法从概念推向大规模部署，以应对当前的能源挑战。

Abstract: The scalable computing revolution of the late '80s through mid- '00s forged a
new technical and economic model for computing that delivered massive societal
impact, but its economic benefit has driven scalability to sizes that are now
exhausting the energy grid's capacity. Our time demands a new revolution in
scalable energy, mirroring in key ways the scalable computing revolution; e.g.,
compelling economic forces, use of mass-market components, overcoming foibles
of those components, judicious use of physical locality, and the the difficult
integration into an effective system. The offgrid AI approach closely fits this
mold, combining local mostly renewable generation and storage to power an AI
data center, starting offgrid. Obstacles to delivering this approach are
social, technical, and project, but the potential is massive. I argue that the
offgrid-AI approach needs pioneers among both system developers and
AI-data-center operators to move it quickly from concept to large-scale
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足新一代分布式空间系统任务对高精度相对导航的严苛需求，需要开发能够实现亚厘米级定位精度的可靠导航解决方案。

Method: 设计了实时导航功能架构，采用稀疏正则化Consider卡尔曼滤波器，开发了轻量级故障检测隔离恢复模块，并进行了全面的测试验证。

Result: 通过VISORS任务验证，实现了亚厘米级相对位置精度和亚毫米/秒级速度精度，软件架构具有良好的通用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该导航架构为采用载波相位差分GNSS技术的下一代分布式空间系统任务提供了参考标准，满足了严苛的精度要求。

Abstract: This paper presents the full requirements analysis, design, development, and
testing of high-precision navigation flight software for Distributed Space
Systems (DSS) using Carrier Phase Differential GNSS (CDGNSS). Five main
contributions are made. First, a survey of flown and upcoming DSS missions with
stringent precision requirements is conducted, from which a thorough
requirements analysis is distilled to guide development and testing. Second, a
real-time navigation functional architecture is designed, and adopts a sparse
and regularized Consider Kalman Filter with options for numerical stability
in-flight. The filter rigorously accounts for uncertainties in process noise,
measurement noise, and biases. It tracks float ambiguities with integer
resolution where possible. The covariance correlation structure is preserved
under all navigation modes, including contingencies and outages. Third, a
lightweight, memoryless Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) module
is developed to guard against anomalous measurements, providing statistical
screening and ensuring robust navigation. Fourth, the software architecture is
proposed for ease of integration, with strategies presented for modularity and
computational efficiency tailored to constrained flight systems. Fifth, a
comprehensive test campaign is conducted, mapped to a requirements verification
matrix, spanning unit, interface, software-in-the-loop, and real-time
hardware-in-the-loop tests, emphasizing gradual test fidelity for efficient
fault isolation. Finally, flight-like results are demonstrated using the VISORS
mission, due to the generalizability of the VISORS navigation operations, and
the stringency which demands sub-centimeter relative position and
sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy. This architecture aims to serve as
a reference for next-generation DSS missions adopting CDGNSS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出量子启发的深度强化学习框架(QI-DRL)，结合LSTM和Ornstein-Uhlenbeck噪声，在纺织裁剪规划中实现13%的成本节省和稳定的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于静态启发式和目录估算的方法难以适应动态生产环境，导致解决方案次优和浪费增加，需要更智能的自适应方法。

Method: 量子启发的深度强化学习框架，整合LSTM网络捕捉序列依赖关系，使用Ornstein-Uhlenbeck噪声促进平滑探索和更快收敛。

Result: 经过1000轮训练，平均奖励0.81(±0.03)，预测损失降至0.15(±0.02)，相比传统方法节省高达13%的布料成本，表现出低变异性和稳定收敛。

Conclusion: 尽管模拟模型做了简化假设，但结果证明了该可扩展自适应框架在提升制造效率方面的潜力，为裁剪规划优化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Cut order planning (COP) is a critical challenge in the textile industry,
directly impacting fabric utilization and production costs. Conventional
methods based on static heuristics and catalog-based estimations often struggle
to adapt to dynamic production environments, resulting in suboptimal solutions
and increased waste. In response, we propose a novel Quantum-Inspired Deep
Reinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework that integrates Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This hybrid approach is
designed to explicitly address key research questions regarding the benefits of
quantum-inspired probabilistic representations, the role of LSTM-based memory
in capturing sequential dependencies, and the effectiveness of OU noise in
facilitating smooth exploration and faster convergence. Extensive training over
1000 episodes demonstrates robust performance, with an average reward of 0.81
(-+0.03) and a steady decrease in prediction loss to 0.15 (-+0.02). A
comparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost
savings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, statistical
evaluations indicate low variability and stable convergence. Despite the fact
that the simulation model makes several simplifying assumptions, these
promising results underscore the potential of the scalable and adaptive
framework to enhance manufacturing efficiency and pave the way for future
innovations in COP optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前架构复杂化的趋势，证明在数据有限的科学领域中，精心设计的简单架构比容易过拟合的复杂替代方案更有效。

Method: 采用统一的Transformer架构，将晶格和原子属性视为单一相互依赖系统，结合基于元素周期表的原子表示和平衡训练策略。

Result: 在MP-20数据集上达到9.62%的SUN率（稳定、独特、新颖），显著优于FlowMM（4.38%）和MatterGen（3.42%），生成63.28%的独特新颖结构。

Conclusion: 架构简单性在材料发现中比复杂性更有效，特别是在数据有限的科学领域中，简单但精心设计的架构能够避免过拟合问题。

Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure
generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend
of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,
CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive
bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent
system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a
balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique,
Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including
FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28%
unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates,
demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than
complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited
scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform
sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种新的数据流离群检测方法DyCF和DyCG，基于克里斯托莫函数理论，解决了传统方法参数调整复杂的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据流离群检测面临分布非稳定性和数据量快速增长的挑战，现有方法往往参数调整复杂，需要简化参数化过程。

Method: DyCF基于克里斯托莫函数和正交多项式理论，DyCG利用克里斯托莫函数的增长特性，免去了参数调整需求。两种方法都基于代数框架，适合低维度数据处理且无需额外内存存储历史数据。

Result: 通过综合和实际工业数据流的对比实验，DyCF在执行时间和内存使用方面表现优于现有精细调整方法。DyCG性能略差但具有免去参数调整的显著优势。

Conclusion: 新提出的两种方法为数据流离群检测提供了有效解决方案，特别是DyCF在性能上显著优于现有方法，而DyCG则为需要免参数调整的应用场景提供了理想选择。

Abstract: Outlier detection holds significant importance in the realm of data mining,
particularly with the growing pervasiveness of data acquisition methods. The
ability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data
quality and detecting faults. However, dealing with data streams presents
challenges due to the non-stationary nature of distributions and the
ever-increasing data volume. While numerous methods have been proposed to
tackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward
parameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods:
DyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of
approximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the
growth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning
parameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic
framework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific
focus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history
without memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and
state-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial
data streams. The results show that DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods,
offering superior performance in terms of execution time and memory usage. DyCG
performs less well, but has the considerable advantage of requiring no tuning
at all.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置预测方法主要依赖历史轨迹数据，但忽略了未来时空上下文的重要性，而了解用户未来旅行时间和距离等上下文信息对预测下一个位置至关重要。

Method: STRelay以中继方式建模未来时空上下文，与基础位置预测模型编码的历史表示相结合，通过多任务学习同时预测下一个时间间隔、移动距离间隔和最终位置。

Result: 在四个真实轨迹数据集上，STRelay与四种最先进的基础模型集成后，一致提升了3.19%-11.56%的预测性能，特别对娱乐相关位置和长途旅行用户群体效果显著。

Conclusion: 未来时空上下文对非日常例行活动（如娱乐）和不确定性较高的场景特别有帮助，与擅长建模日常规律模式的基础模型形成互补，证明了显式建模未来时空上下文的价值。

Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling,
enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management.
Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to
train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they
often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are
highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time
and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting
the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay},
a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal
\textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future
spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of
different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future
spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated
with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction
model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time
interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We
evaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base
models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay
consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by
3.19\%-11.56\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts
are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user
groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such
non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is
indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at
modeling regular daily routine patterns.

Conclusion: RAST框架通过检索增强机制有效提升了交通预测的性能，特别是在处理复杂时空依赖和细粒度预测方面表现出色，为智能交通系统提供了有力的技术支撑。

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation
systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced
Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have
achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain:
(i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal
dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal
points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates
retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these
challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder
and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and
construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval
Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns;
and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained
STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world
traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST
achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have been extensively applied across various domains, where
memory stands out as one of their most essential capabilities. Previous memory
mechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts,
leading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these
methods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is
critical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address
these challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with
an adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles.
Specifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval,
propose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and
develop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework
empowers LLM-based agents to learn how to memorize information effectively in
specific environments, with both off-policy and on-policy optimization. In
order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct
comprehensive experiments across multiple aspects. To benefit the research
community in this area, we release our project at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地下形势中常常存在幽长断层，这些断层会强烈影响流体流动，特别是在地质碳存储场景下。需要快速预测压力和CO2饱和度以评估漏泉风险。

Method: 开发了新的重复Transformer U-Net替代模型，包含目标浓层、围岩、盖山岩和两个幽长断层。采用4000个随机采样实例进行训练，考虑地质元参数和细细元属性的层次性不确定性。

Result: 该模型比之前的重复殊余U-Net更准确，并在不同漏泉场景下保持准确性。数据同化结果显示，在所有三个浓层中测量压力和饱和度可有效降低不确定性。

Conclusion: 新的Transformer U-Net替代模型能够高效预测地下CO2存储系统中的压力和饱和度分布，特别是在存在断层的复杂地质条件下。多层监测策略可显著提升风险评估的准确性。

Abstract: Many subsurface formations, including some of those under consideration for
large-scale geological carbon storage, include extensive faults that can
strongly impact fluid flow. In this study, we develop a new recurrent
transformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure
and CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The
geomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),
surrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.
The faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The
heterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by
hierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,
mean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell
properties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also
treated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)
4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is
more accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains
accuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is
then used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical
Markov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different
monitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed
data collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true
models. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction
achieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D
saturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring
pressure and saturation in all three aquifers.

Abstract: The persistent challenge of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks has
motivated extensive research in continual learning . This work presents a novel

Comprehensive evaluations on standard continual learning benchmarks including
SplitMNIST, PermutedMNIST, and SplitFashionMNIST demonstrate substantial
improvements over existing approaches such as Variational Continual Learning
and Elastic Weight Consolidation . The asymmetric variance penalty mechanism
proves particularly effective in maintaining knowledge across sequential tasks
while improving model accuracy. Experimental results show our approach not only
boosts immediate task performance but also significantly mitigates knowledge
degradation over time, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks

Motivation: 传统图移位算子(GSO)缺乏对非相邻节点间依赖关系的建模灵活性，限制了复杂图结构的表示能力。

Method: 提出UEM框架，通过参数化设计整合扩展邻接矩阵和统一图表示矩阵；提出基于UEM的图傅里叶变换(UEM-GFT)，可自适应调整频谱特性。

Conclusion: UEM框架有效解决了传统GSO的局限性，提供了更灵活的图信号处理工具，在各种网络拓扑中都能取得优越性能。

Abstract: Graph signal processing has become an essential tool for analyzing data
structured on irregular domains. While conventional graph shift operators
(GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in
modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to
represent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the
extended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix through
parametric design, so as to be able to flexibly adapt to different graph
structures and reveal more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of
the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue
monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we propose graph Fourier
transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT), which can adaptively tune spectral properties
to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based
methods in anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior performance across
varying network topologies.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural scheme for the topology-aware interpolation of
time-varying scalar fields. Given a time-varying sequence of persistence
diagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar
fields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at "inverting"
the non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the
corresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which
learns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based
on the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the
non-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific
topological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical
and topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,
given an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach
instantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input
through the network. Experiments interpolating 2D and 3D time-varying datasets
show our approach superiority, both in terms of data and topological fitting,
with regard to reference interpolation schemes.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD), which aims to
continuously learn from new fault classes with only a few samples without
forgetting old ones, is critical for real-world industrial systems. However,
this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting
of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity
Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN
explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a
fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order
Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific
features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation
stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared
across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a
multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained
knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting
and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a
decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision
boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP
benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN
achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to
state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管时间序列基础模型在预测、异常检测等方面表现出强大的泛化能力，但在实际应用中仍存在方差大、领域偏差和不确定性量化有限等问题，需要统计方法来增强其性能。

Result: 在比利时电力短期负荷预测数据集上，混合模型在所有预测范围内均优于独立基础模型：回归集成获得最低MSE，bootstrap聚合显著减少长上下文误差，残差建模纠正系统偏差，预测区间覆盖率达到名义水平且宽度随上下文长度增加而减小。

Conclusion: 将统计推理与现代基础模型相结合，能够在准确性、可靠性和可解释性方面为实际时间序列应用带来显著提升，证明了统计增强方法的有效性。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) such as Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos,
MOMENT, UniTS, and TimesFM have shown strong generalization and zero-shot
capabilities for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, classification,
and imputation. Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from
variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when
deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of
statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including
bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval
construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to
improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load
Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids
consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons.
Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap
aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects
systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal
coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results
indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models
yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for
real-world time series applications.

Abstract: From large language models to multi-modal agents, Generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI) now underpins state-of-the-art systems. Despite their varied
architectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable
models (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density
estimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a
unified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods
within the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models
such as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item
response theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential
extensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical
Systems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep
PLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential
PLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative
Adversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a
common probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference
strategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths. We
offer a conceptual roadmap that consolidates generative AI's theoretical
foundations, clarifies methodological lineages, and guides future innovation by
grounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) directly on edge devices has attracted
increasing attention, as it offers promising solutions to challenges such as
domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, conventional DNN training
typically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on
edge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To
address this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),
named NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting
dimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling
in the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based
methods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,
NMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method
and the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the
emergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,
target perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and
leading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of
examplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose
AdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided
optimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative
training samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the
edge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and
entropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and
time-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.

Conclusion: 通过解耦流场空间编码和压力时间测量，为数据受限实验环境提供了可扩展的鲁棒高频湍流重建解决方案

Abstract: Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent
wake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a
significant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In
contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall
pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study,
we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which
reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing
synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during
training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first
stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder
($p$C-$\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the
intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized
low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling
reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once
trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure
inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the
$p$C-$\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics
from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust
solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in
data-constrained experimental settings.

Abstract: We propose HiCL, a novel hippocampal-inspired dual-memory continual learning
architecture designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by using elements
inspired by the hippocampal circuitry. Our system encodes inputs through a
grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate
gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are
maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is
dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs
are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized
sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed
through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet
mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable
task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the
model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks.
Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted
by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of
stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on
standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art
results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

Motivation: 现有的远程心率监测系统缺乏对身体活动上下文的考量，导致心率变化难以准确评估。虽然AI模型可提高监测准确性，但活动数据的整合仍然很少被考虑。

Method: 提出Transformer模型结合Laplace扩散技术，通过专门的嵌入表示和注意力机制，将活动上下文作为整个模型过程的条件。模型包含上下文化嵌入和专门编码器，能够捐捕长期模式和活动特定的心率动态。

Conclusion: 该模型是一种实用有效的工具，能够支持健康服务提供者和远程患者监测系统，通过结合身体活动上下文显著提高了心率预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: With the advent of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remote patient
monitoring (RPM) emerged as a promising solution for managing heart failure.
However, the heart rate can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, and
without correlating it to the patient's actual physical activity, it becomes
difficult to assess whether changes are significant. Although Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding
of remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still
rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a
Laplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical
activity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary,
our approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using
specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific
historical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and
activity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized
embeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a
real-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the
considered baseline models. Moreover, the coefficient of determination R2 is
0.97 indicating the model predicted heart rate is in strong agreement with
actual heart rate values. These findings suggest that the proposed model is a
practical and effective tool for supporting both healthcare providers and
remote patient monitoring systems.

Abstract: The expansion of machine learning into dynamic environments presents
challenges in handling open-world problems where label shift, covariate shift,
and unknown classes emerge. Post-training methods have been explored to address
these challenges, adapting models to newly emerging data. However, these
methods struggle when the initial pre-training is performed on class-imbalanced
datasets, limiting generalization to minority classes. To address this, we
propose a method that effectively handles open-world problems even when
pre-training is conducted on imbalanced data. Our contrastive-based
pre-training approach enhances classification performance, particularly for
underrepresented classes. Our post-training mechanism generates reliable
pseudo-labels, improving model robustness against open-world problems. We also
introduce selective activation criteria to optimize the post-training process,
reducing unnecessary computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adaptation techniques in both
accuracy and efficiency across diverse open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: WISCA方法通过系统性优化权重模式，有效提升了LLM的训练效率和模型性能

Abstract: Transformer architecture gradually dominates the LLM field. Recent advances
in training optimization for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
primarily focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments.
However, these approaches lack systematic optimization of weight patterns
during training. Weight pattern refers to the distribution and relative
magnitudes of weight parameters in a neural network. To address this issue, we
propose a Weight Scaling method called WISCA to enhance training efficiency and
model quality by strategically improving neural network weight patterns without
changing network structures. By rescaling weights while preserving model
outputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory.
Experiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality
(measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in
LLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning
tasks. Empirical results show 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation
tasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple
architectures.

Abstract: Many existing studies have achieved significant improvements in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR), while the enhancement of reasoning abilities in
small language models (SLMs) has not yet been sufficiently explored. Combining
distilled data from larger models with RLVR on small models themselves is a
natural approach, but it still faces various challenges and issues. Therefore,
we propose \textit{\underline{R}}ecall-\textit{\underline{E}}xtend
\textit{\underline{D}}ynamics(RED): Enhancing Small Language Models through
Controlled Exploration and Refined Offline Integration. In this paper, we
explore the perspective of varying exploration spaces, balancing offline
distillation with online reinforcement learning. Simultaneously, we
specifically design and optimize for the insertion problem within offline data.
By monitoring the ratio of entropy changes in the model concerning offline and
online data, we regulate the weight of offline-SFT, thereby addressing the
issues of insufficient exploration space in small models and the redundancy and
complexity during the distillation process. Furthermore, to tackle the
distribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, we
design a sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism that dynamically chooses
between imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy.

Motivation: 传统SVD压缩方法专注于最小化矩阵重构误差，但会导致模型功能性能显著下降，因为现有方法未能充分校正压缩过程中丢失的功能信息

Conclusion: 将功能信息损失视为可学习信号是一种高效的压缩范式，能够创建更小更高效的LLM，推动其在现实应用中的可访问性和实际部署

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques
are essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained
environments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating
weight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix
reconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's
functional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing
methods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during
compression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank
Decomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a
primary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank
corrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual
error. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and
Llama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to
51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,
consistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows
that treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly
effective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of
significantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and
practical deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent
transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the
Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a
unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively
captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on
separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly
models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically
weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its
capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into
neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling
effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive
experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction
horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt
to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of uncertainty in neural network predictions remains
a central challenge for scientific applications involving high-dimensional,
correlated data. While existing methods capture either aleatoric or epistemic
uncertainty, few offer closed-form, multidimensional distributions that
preserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable. In this
work, we present a framework for training neural networks with a
multidimensional Gaussian loss, generating closed-form predictive distributions
over outputs with non-identically distributed and heteroscedastic structure.
Our approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by iteratively estimating the means
and covariance matrices, and is demonstrated on a super-resolution example. We
leverage a Fourier representation of the covariance matrix to stabilize network
training and preserve spatial correlation. We introduce a novel regularization
strategy -- referred to as information sharing -- that interpolates between
image-specific and global covariance estimates, enabling convergence of the
super-resolution downscaling network trained on image-specific distributional
loss functions. This framework allows for efficient sampling, explicit
correlation modeling, and extensions to more complex distribution families all
without disrupting prediction performance. We demonstrate the method on a

uncertainty-aware prediction in scientific models.

TL;DR: 提出将概念表示为线性子空间而非点向量的新嵌入范式，通过子空间维度和包含关系自然建模通用性、层次关系和集合操作，在WordNet重建和自然语言推理任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经嵌入将概念表示为点向量，擅长相似性计算但难以处理高级推理和非对称关系，需要新的表示方法来支持逻辑操作和形式语义

Method: 引入线性子空间嵌入框架，通过子空间维度表示通用性，子空间包含表示层次关系；提出正交投影算子的平滑松弛方法，可微分学习子空间方向和维度

Result: 在WordNet重建和链接预测任务上达到最先进结果；在自然语言推理基准测试中超越双编码器基线，提供可解释的蕴含关系几何表示

Conclusion: 子空间嵌入为概念表示提供了几何基础和逻辑操作能力的新范式，既能保持传统嵌入的相似性优势，又能支持高级推理和形式语义操作

Abstract: Traditional neural embeddings represent concepts as points, excelling at
similarity but struggling with higher-level reasoning and asymmetric
relationships. We introduce a novel paradigm: embedding concepts as linear
subspaces. This framework inherently models generality via subspace
dimensionality and hierarchy through subspace inclusion. It naturally supports
set-theoretic operations like intersection (conjunction), linear sum
(disjunction) and orthogonal complements (negations), aligning with classical
formal semantics. To enable differentiable learning, we propose a smooth
relaxation of orthogonal projection operators, allowing for the learning of
both subspace orientation and dimension. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in reconstruction and link prediction on WordNet. Furthermore, on
natural language inference benchmarks, our subspace embeddings surpass
bi-encoder baselines, offering an interpretable formulation of entailment that
is both geometrically grounded and amenable to logical operations.

TL;DR: 提出辅助方程神经网络方法(AENNM)，将神经网络与辅助方程法结合求解非线性偏微分方程，通过Riccati方程解构造新型激活函数，显著提升计算效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法求解非线性偏微分方程存在计算效率低和精度不足的问题，需要结合神经网络的强大逼近能力和符号计算的高精度优势。

Method: 提出AENNM方法，基于Riccati方程解构造新型激活函数，在"2-2-2-1"和"3-2-2-1"神经网络模型中嵌入辅助方程法，获得双曲函数、三角函数和有理函数形式的精确解析解。

Conclusion: AENNM为求解非线性偏微分方程提供了新颖的方法框架，在科学和工程领域具有广泛的应用前景，建立了微分方程理论与深度学习之间的新数学联系。

Abstract: In this study, we firstly propose an auxiliary equation neural networks
method (AENNM), an innovative analytical method that integrates neural networks
(NNs) models with the auxiliary equation method to obtain exact solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs). A key novelty of this method
is the introduction of a novel activation function derived from the solutions
of the Riccati equation, establishing a new mathematical link between
differential equations theory and deep learning. By combining the strong
approximation capability of NNs with the high precision of symbolic
computation, AENNM significantly enhances computational efficiency and
accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the AENNM in solving NLPDEs,
three numerical examples are investigated, including the nonlinear evolution
equation, the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation, and the (2+1)-dimensional
Boussinesq equation. Furthermore, some new trial functions are constructed by
setting specific activation functions within the "2-2-2-1" and "3-2-2-1" NNs
models. By embedding the auxiliary equation method into the NNs framework, we
derive previously unreported solutions. The exact analytical solutions are
expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, and
rational functions. Finally, three-dimensional plots, contour plots, and
density plots are presented to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of the
obtained solutions. This research provides a novel methodological framework for
addressing NLPDEs, with broad applicability across scientific and engineering
fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布精确优化(DRO)方法与现代深度学习实践存在显著差距，需要适应性、处理随机梯度以及支持组级权重分配的方法来填补这个空白。

Method: 提出ALSO（适应性损失缩放优化器）算法，这是一种适用于修改后DRO目标的适应性算法，能够处理样本组的权重分配。证明了该算法在非凸目标下的收敛性。

Result: 在从表格数据深度学习到分割学习等多种深度学习任务中，ALSO都表现出超过传统优化器和现有DRO方法的优异性能。

Conclusion: ALSO成功填补了DRO与现代DL实践之间的差距，提供了一种适应性强、支持随机梯度和组级权重分配的高效优化方案，在广泛的DL应用场景中都显示出优异性能。

Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training
samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns
importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists
between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity
and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate
superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should
allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of
objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge
this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer
$\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can
handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our
proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL
models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular
DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional
optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Conclusion: 深度学习为Lyapunov函数构造提供了自动化解决方案，扩展了传统方法的适用范围

Abstract: Lyapunov functions are fundamental to establishing the stability of Markovian
models, yet their construction typically demands substantial creativity and
analytical effort. In this paper, we show that deep learning can automate this
process by training neural networks to satisfy integral equations derived from
first-transition analysis. Beyond stability analysis, our approach can be
adapted to solve Poisson's equation and estimate stationary distributions.
While neural networks are inherently function approximators on compact domains,
it turns out that our approach remains effective when applied to Markov chains
on non-compact state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
methodology through several examples from queueing theory and beyond.

Conclusion: 小模型可以可靠地支撑大模型，释放潜在能力同时避免强教师可能引入的错误提示，为高效安全的LLM提示优化提供了可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a challenging task for many
applications. We introduce Weak-to-Strong Transfer (WST), an automatic prompt
engineering framework where a small "Teacher" model generates instructions that
enhance the performance of a much larger "Student" model. Unlike prior work,
WST requires only a weak teacher, making it efficient and broadly applicable in
settings where large models are closed-source or difficult to fine-tune. Using
reinforcement learning, the Teacher Model's instructions are iteratively
improved based on the Student Model's outcomes, yielding substantial gains
across reasoning (MATH-500, GSM8K) and alignment (HH-RLHF) benchmarks - 98% on
MATH-500 and 134% on HH-RLHF - and surpassing baselines such as GPT-4o-mini and
Llama-70B. These results demonstrate that small models can reliably scaffold
larger ones, unlocking latent capabilities while avoiding misleading prompts
that stronger teachers may introduce, establishing WST as a scalable solution
for efficient and safe LLM prompt refinement.

Abstract: Taxonomic classification in biodiversity research involves organizing
biological specimens into structured hierarchies based on evidence, which can
come from multiple modalities such as images and genetic information. We
investigate whether hyperbolic networks can provide a better embedding space

other models on unseen species classification using DNA barcodes. However,
fine-grained classification and open-world generalization remain challenging.
Our framework offers a structure-aware foundation for biodiversity modelling,
with potential applications to species discovery, ecological monitoring, and

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability of large language models, yet understanding
how they learn and perform multi-step reasoning remains an open problem. In
this study, we explore how different architectures and training methods affect
model multi-step reasoning capabilities within a cellular automata framework.
By training on state sequences generated with random Boolean functions for
random initial conditions to exclude memorization, we demonstrate that most
neural architectures learn to abstract the underlying rules. While models
achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines
sharply if multi-step reasoning is required. We confirm that increasing model
depth plays a crucial role for sequential computations. We demonstrate that an
extension of the effective model depth with recurrence, memory, and test-time
compute scaling substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习改善机器学习公平性的方法尚未在多模态环境下探索，不同模态包含的独特信息可以互补

Method: 基于VICReg方法设计主题级损失函数，包含三个机制：方差项减少对保护属性的依赖、不变性项确保相似个体的预测一致性、协方差项最小化与保护属性的相关性

Result: 在D-Vlog、MIMIC和MODMA三个医疗数据集上，框架提高了整体公平性性能，分类性能下降最小，显著改善了性能-公平性帕累托前沿

Conclusion: FAIRWELL方法能够有效学习公平的多模态表示，在保持分类性能的同时显著提升公平性

Abstract: Early efforts on leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) to improve machine
learning (ML) fairness has proven promising. However, such an approach has yet
to be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a
multimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information
that can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we
propose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via
the following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance
regularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance
on the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,
which ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the
covariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected
attribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain
subject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal
prediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world
heterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain
different modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our
findings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with
minimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on
the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: DR-CircuitGNN有效解决了HGNN在EDA电路图分析中的计算瓶颈问题，为大规模集成电路设计自动化提供了高效的计算解决方案

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of integrated circuit design have led to
increased challenges in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as
circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation
for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA
designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA
circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric
features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of
even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial
module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance
bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design
by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels
during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on
EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose
a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by
concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU
initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our
experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small,
medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup
compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On
full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables
up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with
negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.

Abstract: Inferring temporal interaction graphs and higher-order structure from neural
signals is a key problem in building generative models for systems
neuroscience. Foundation models for large-scale neural data represent shared
latent structures of neural signals. However, extracting interpretable latent
graph representations in foundation models remains challenging and unsolved.
Here we explore latent graph learning in generative models of neural signals.
By testing against numerical simulations of neural circuits with known
ground-truth connectivity, we evaluate several hypotheses for explaining
learned model weights. We discover modest alignment between extracted network
representations and the underlying directed graphs and strong alignment in the
co-input graph representations. These findings motivate paths towards
incorporating graph-based geometric constraints in the construction of
large-scale foundation models for neural data.

Conclusion: 量化的效果因模型和任务而异，但未观察到任何剧烈变化，量化仍可作为可靠的模型压缩技术

Abstract: Quantization offers a practical solution to deploy LLMs in
resource-constraint environments. However, its impact on internal
representations remains understudied, raising questions about the reliability
of quantized models. In this study, we employ a range of interpretability
techniques to investigate how quantization affects model and neuron behavior.
We analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. Our findings
reveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor.
Analysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e.,
those with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent
regardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we
observe that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons,
whereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B. The
effect of quantization on neuron redundancy varies across models. Overall, our
findings suggest that effect of quantization may vary by model and tasks,
however, we did not observe any drastic change which may discourage the use of
quantization as a reliable model compression technique.

Conclusion: Anchor-MoE提供了一个统一框架处理概率和点回归，具有理论保证和优异的实证性能

Abstract: Regression under uncertainty is fundamental across science and engineering.
We present an Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor-MoE), a model that handles
both probabilistic and point regression. For simplicity, we use a tuned
gradient-boosting model to furnish the anchor mean; however, any off-the-shelf
point regressor can serve as the anchor. The anchor prediction is projected
into a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and
a soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network
experts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive
variance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint
calibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point
accuracy. On the theory side, assuming a H\"older smooth regression function of
order~$\alpha$ and fixed Lipschitz partition-of-unity weights with bounded
overlap, we show that Anchor-MoE attains the minimax-optimal $L^2$ risk rate
$O\!\big(N^{-2\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}\big)$. In addition, the CRPS test
generalization gap scales as
$\widetilde{O}\!\Big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\Big)$; it is logarithmic in $Mh$
and scales as the square root in $P$ and $K$. Under bounded-overlap routing,
$K$ can be replaced by $k$, and any dependence on a latent dimension is
absorbed into $P$. Under uniformly bounded means and variances, an analogous
$\widetilde{O}\!\big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\big)$ scaling holds for the test
NLL up to constants. Empirically, across standard UCI regressions, Anchor-MoE
consistently matches or surpasses the strong NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL;
on several datasets it achieves new state-of-the-art probabilistic regression
results on our benchmark suite. Code is available at

Conclusion: UPN提供连续深度建模、自适应评估策略、原则性不确定性量化，并能自然处理不规则采样观测，为连续时间建模提供了强大的不确定性量化框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family
of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty
quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that
predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution
and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations
for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates
uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by
solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling
state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation
adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled
uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations
naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple
domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification,
time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust
trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.

over-smoothing and over-squashing, due to irregular data structures. The
observation and formulation of these limitations have become foundational in
constructing more informative graph representations. In this paper, we delve
into the limitations of MPNNs, focusing on aspects that have previously been
overlooked. Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the
information specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To
delve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution
and formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for
attribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also
introduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and
complements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. Our findings provide
new insights and contribute to the development of informative representations.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative
tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality
content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains.
However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing
standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the
excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and
memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based
framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel
training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide
range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly
reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen
incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that
accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps
and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided,
communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized
latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance
gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing relies heavily on fusion welding processes, including
gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Despite significant advances in machine
learning-based quality prediction, current models exhibit critical limitations
when confronted with the inherent distribution shifts that occur in dynamic
manufacturing environments. In this work, we extend the VQ-VAE Transformer
architecture - previously demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in weld
quality prediction - by leveraging its autoregressive loss as a reliable
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanism. Our approach exhibits superior
performance compared to conventional reconstruction methods, embedding
error-based techniques, and other established baselines. By integrating OOD
detection with continual learning strategies, we optimize model adaptation,
triggering updates only when necessary and thereby minimizing costly labeling
requirements. We introduce a novel quantitative metric that simultaneously
evaluates OOD detection capability while interpreting in-distribution
performance. Experimental validation in real-world welding scenarios
demonstrates that our framework effectively maintains robust quality prediction
capabilities across significant distribution shifts, addressing critical
challenges in dynamic manufacturing environments where process parameters
frequently change. This research makes a substantial contribution to applied
artificial intelligence by providing an explainable and at the same time
adaptive solution for quality assurance in dynamic manufacturing processes - a
crucial step towards robust, practical AI systems in the industrial
environment.

Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on
real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard

computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant
challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater
Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for
real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments
of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized

(QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture
significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time
onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high
accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive
Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and
reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach
enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with
Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient
detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a

Abstract: Industrial chain plays an increasingly important role in the sustainable
development of national economy. However, as a typical complex network,
data-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing
the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical
framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary
dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to
learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it
into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical
information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics
and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain
resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better
results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and
effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of
the industry.

TL;DR: 提出Neural Contrast Expansion (NCE)方法，结合强对比展开理论和神经网络，为复合材料有效性质预测提供既高效又可解释的结构-性质模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，求解PDE成本高但可解释性强，数据驱动模型效率高但可解释性差。需要一种既能保持计算效率又能提供可解释敏感性分析的方法

Method: 基于强对比展开(SCE)形式，提出NCE架构，从结构-性质数据中学习替代PDE核函数，仅需宏观性质测量而不需要PDE解场测量

Result: 在静态传导和电磁波传播案例中，NCE模型显示出准确且具有洞察力的敏感性信息，可用于材料设计

Conclusion: NCE方法为线性自伴PDE控制的复合材料性质预测提供了成本效益高且可解释的解决方案，特别适用于实际材料开发场景

Abstract: Effective properties of composite materials are defined as the ensemble
average of property-specific PDE solutions over the underlying microstructure
distributions. Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving
PDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that
directly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher
running cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide
material design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead
is amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a
focus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,
Helmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we
propose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.
Our method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,
which analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to
its effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes
and analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast
Expansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels
from structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave
propagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful
sensitivity information useful for material design. Compared with other PDE
kernel learning methods, our method does not require measurements about the PDE
solution fields, but rather only requires macroscopic property measurements
that are more accessible in material development contexts.

Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across
heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground
truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these
challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised
learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for
large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging.
Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial
layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and
enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively
balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent
loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At
the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based
post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which
enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin,
particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a
scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and
efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Motivation: 神经网络湍流闭合模型缺乏不确定性量化，特别是在训练数据范围外的输入情况下，这限制了其广泛应用

Method: 使用已发布的代数湍流闭合模型，比较Deep Ensembles、Monte-Carlo Dropout、Stochastic Variational Inference三种NN方法和Gaussian Process在认知不确定性量化方面的质量

Result: 在训练区域内GP精度最高（RMSE=2.14e-5），DE次之（4.59e-4）；在训练外区域GP和DE性能相似，但DE在负对数似然方面表现最佳；计算成本GP显著高于NN方法

Conclusion: 对于当前问题，精度排序为GP > DE > SVI > MCD；DE结果相对稳健并提供直观的不确定性估计，尽管采用简单集成方法；GP计算复杂度为O(n^3)，显著高于基于NN的方法

Abstract: Neural-Network (NN) based turbulence closures have been developed for being
used as pre-trained surrogates for traditional turbulence closures, with the
aim to increase computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of CFD
simulations. The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based
closures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these
models. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training
inputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs
outside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic
turbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ
between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based
methods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and
Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the
exact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of
$2.14 \cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \cdot 10^{-4}$.
Next, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying
out-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the
best in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the
out-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and
DE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE
performs the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We
observe that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I >
MCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates,
despite performing naive ensembling. In terms of computational cost, the GP is
significantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational
complexity for each training step

TL;DR: Tri-Accel是一个统一的优化框架，通过协同调整三种加速策略（自适应精度更新、稀疏二阶信号和内存弹性批处理缩放）来减少神经网络训练的时间和内存消耗，同时提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在优化过程中面临GPU内存和计算时间的瓶颈，现有加速技术通常孤立使用，缺乏统一的协同优化方法。

Method: 提出Tri-Accel框架，包含：(1)基于曲率和梯度方差动态分配混合精度级别的精度自适应更新；(2)利用Hessian/Fisher稀疏模式指导精度和步长决策的稀疏二阶信号；(3)根据VRAM可用性实时调整批处理大小的内存弹性批处理缩放。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet-B0，训练时间减少9.9%，内存使用降低13.3%，准确率比FP32基线提高1.1个百分点。与静态混合精度训练相比，在保持78.1%准确率的同时将内存占用从0.35GB降至0.31GB。

Conclusion: Tri-Accel展示了算法自适应性和硬件感知相结合可以改善资源受限环境中的可扩展性，为边缘设备和成本敏感的云部署提供更高效的神经网络训练方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by the cost of
optimization, both in terms of GPU memory and compute time. Existing
acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and
batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a
unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies
along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates
that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and
gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher
sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3)
Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to
VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel
achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage,
while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested
on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with
efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns
to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision
training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint
from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with
custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic
optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for
deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates
how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve
scalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient
neural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

Motivation: 随着家庭银行系统的普及，网络证券欺诈风险不断增加，需要既准确又公平可解释的欺诈检测机制。现有AI模型在计算效率、可解释性和超参数优化稳定性方面遇到挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了结合群体编码SNN和强化学习超策略在实际金融应用中实现公平、透明且高性能欺诈检测的潜力。

Abstract: The growing adoption of home banking systems has heightened the risk of
cyberfraud, necessitating fraud detection mechanisms that are not only accurate
but also fair and explainable. While AI models have shown promise in this
domain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the
interpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the
complexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement
learning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with
Population Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer
for Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs
population coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to
dynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under
fairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory
Framework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system
incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based
attribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated
on the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\%$
recall at a strict $5\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming
state-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\%$
predictive equality across key demographic attributes. The explainability
module further confirms that saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics,
validating interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining population-coded SNNs with reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristics for
fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in real-world financial
applications.

Motivation: 虽然Transformer模型被认为在高维隐藏空间中操作，但研究发现注意力输出实际上存在于低维子空间，这种低秩结构是稀疏字典学习中死特征问题的根本原因

Method: 提出子空间约束训练方法，将特征方向初始化到激活的活跃子空间中，适用于注意力输出稀疏自编码器和其他稀疏字典学习方法

Result: 在具有100万个特征的注意力输出SAE中，死特征比例从87%降至1%以下

Conclusion: 研究揭示了注意力几何结构的新见解，并为改进大型语言模型中的稀疏字典学习提供了实用工具

Abstract: While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional
hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are confined to a surprisingly
low-dimensional subspace, where about 60\% of the directions account for 99\%
of the variance--a phenomenon that is induced by the attention output
projection matrix and consistently observed across diverse model families and
datasets. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a fundamental cause of
the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it
creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic
geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a
subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs),
initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our
approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs
with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning
methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention
and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language
models.

Conclusion: DUFL机制能有效协调数据新鲜度和数据量，为联邦学习中数据陈旧性问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Handling data staleness remains a significant challenge in federated learning
with highly time-sensitive tasks, where data is generated continuously and data
staleness largely affects model performance. Although recent works attempt to
optimize data staleness by determining local data update frequency or client
selection strategy, none of them explore taking both data staleness and data
volume into consideration. In this paper, we propose DUFL(Data Updating in
Federated Learning), an incentive mechanism featuring an innovative local data
update scheme manipulated by three knobs: the server's payment, outdated data
conservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume, to coordinate
staleness and volume of local data for best utilities. To this end, we
introduce a novel metric called DoS(the Degree of Staleness) to quantify data
staleness and conduct a theoretic analysis illustrating the quantitative
relationship between DoS and model performance. We model DUFL as a two-stage
Stackelberg game with dynamic constraint, deriving the optimal local data
update strategy for each client in closed-form and the approximately optimal
strategy for the server. Experimental results on real-world datasets
demonstrate the significant performance of our approach.

Conclusion: 基于签名的近似方法在高效生成建模方面具有有效性

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in generative
modelling but remain computationally intensive at inference time, often
requiring thousands of discretization steps. To this end, we propose Sig-DEG
(Signature-based Differential Equation Generator), a novel generator for
distilling pre-trained diffusion models, which can universally approximate the
backward diffusion process at a coarse temporal resolution. Inspired by
high-order approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Sig-DEG
leverages partial signatures to efficiently summarize Brownian motion over
sub-intervals and adopts a recurrent structure to enable accurate global
approximation of the SDE solution. Distillation is formulated as a supervised
learning task, where Sig-DEG is trained to match the outputs of a
fine-resolution diffusion model on a coarse time grid. During inference,
Sig-DEG enables fast generation, as the partial signature terms can be
simulated exactly without requiring fine-grained Brownian paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Sig-DEG achieves competitive generation quality while reducing
the number of inference steps by an order of magnitude. Our results highlight
the effectiveness of signature-based approximations for efficient generative
modeling.

the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of
LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be
explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded
Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework
designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.
Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit
scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics
are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse
high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,
encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)
verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain
robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL
on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding
reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL
significantly boosts Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500,
surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading
LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

*Manan Gupta,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种量化神经元多义性的指标PSI，通过几何聚类质量、标签对齐和语义差异性综度，在ResNet-50上证明了深层神经元具有更高的多义性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络中存在多义神经元，这些神经元对多个有时无关的特征产生响应，结构化解释性复杂，需要量化评估方法

Method: 设计了PSI指标，包含三个组件：几何聚类质量(S)、标签分类对齐度(Q)、通过CLIP的开放词汇语义差异性(D)，并通过补丁替换干预进行因果验证

Result: 在ResNet-50上识别出具有清晰原型的多义神经元，发现深层神经元的PSI显著高于浅层，并通过各种稳健性检验和因果干预验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: PSI提供了一种有理论基础且实用的方法，用于发现、量化和研究神经网络中的多义单元，为机制解释性研究提供了重要工具

Abstract: Neural networks often contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple,
sometimes unrelated, features, complicating mechanistic interpretability. We
introduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that
quantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct
clusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric
cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary
semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with
Tiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into
coherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers
exhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach
with robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and
cross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs.
open-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular,
aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more
than non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls. PSI
thus offers a principled and practical lever for discovering, quantifying, and
studying polysemantic units in neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过激活导向方法研究大语言模型的反思机制，发现可以通过激活干预来增强或抑制反思行为，且抑制反思比激发更容易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注反思提示策略或强化学习目标，而对反思的内在机制探索不足，需要从模型激活的潜在方向来深入理解反思机制。

Method: 提出基于激活导向的方法，构建不同反思级别（无反思、内在反思、触发反思）之间的导向向量，通过激活干预来控制和表征反思行为。

Result: 实验表明：1）可以系统识别新的反思诱导指令；2）通过激活干预可以直接增强或抑制反思行为；3）抑制反思比激发反思更容易。在GSM8k-adv数据集上的实验证实了反思级别的清晰分层和可控性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解LLMs中反思推理的机制开辟了路径，既展示了增强反思防御的机会，也揭示了对抗性抑制反思在越狱攻击中的风险。

Abstract: Reflection, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate and
revise their own reasoning, has been widely used to improve performance on
complex reasoning tasks. Yet, most prior work emphasizes designing reflective
prompting strategies or reinforcement learning objectives, leaving the inner
mechanisms of reflection underexplored. In this paper, we investigate
reflection through the lens of latent directions in model activations. We
propose a methodology based on activation steering to characterize how
instructions with different reflective intentions: no reflection, intrinsic
reflection, and triggered reflection. By constructing steering vectors between
these reflection levels, we demonstrate that (1) new reflection-inducing
instructions can be systematically identified, (2) reflective behavior can be
directly enhanced or suppressed through activation interventions, and (3)
suppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it. Experiments
on GSM8k-adv with Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B reveal clear stratification across
reflection levels, and steering interventions confirm the controllability of
reflection. Our findings highlight both opportunities (e.g.,
reflection-enhancing defenses) and risks (e.g., adversarial inhibition of
reflection in jailbreak attacks). This work opens a path toward mechanistic
understanding of reflective reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究具有长期预算约束的对抗性在线学习问题，提出了一种高效的一阶在线算法，在完全信息和bandit反馈设置下都能实现O(√T) α-regret，同时资源消耗最多为O(B_T log T) + ˜O(√T)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线学习中的长期预算约束问题，特别是在对抗性设置下，处理α-近似凸函数这一广泛函数类，该函数类推广了凸性并包含许多常见的非凸优化问题。

Method: 提出一种高效的一阶在线算法，适用于完全信息和bandit反馈设置。算法在每轮选择动作后接收成本函数和资源消耗函数，目标是设计在线算法在满足长期预算约束的同时最小化累积成本。

Result: 算法保证了对最优固定可行基准的O(√T) α-regret，资源消耗最多为O(B_T log T) + ˜O(√T)。在bandit反馈设置下，为"Adversarial Bandits with Knapsacks"问题提供了改进保证的解决方案。

Conclusion: 证明了匹配的下界，展示了结果的紧性，并刻画了α-近似凸函数类，表明结果适用于广泛的优化问题家族。

Abstract: We study an online learning problem with long-term budget constraints in the
adversarial setting. In this problem, at each round $t$, the learner selects an
action from a convex decision set, after which the adversary reveals a cost
function $f_t$ and a resource consumption function $g_t$. The cost and
consumption functions are assumed to be $\alpha$-approximately convex - a broad
class that generalizes convexity and encompasses many common non-convex
optimization problems, including DR-submodular maximization, Online Vertex
Cover, and Regularized Phase Retrieval. The goal is to design an online
algorithm that minimizes cumulative cost over a horizon of length $T$ while
approximately satisfying a long-term budget constraint of $B_T$. We propose an
efficient first-order online algorithm that guarantees $O(\sqrt{T})$
$\alpha$-regret against the optimal fixed feasible benchmark while consuming at
most $O(B_T \log T)+ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ resources in both full-information
and bandit feedback settings. In the bandit feedback setting, our approach
yields an efficient solution for the $\texttt{Adversarial Bandits with
Knapsacks}$ problem with improved guarantees. We also prove matching lower
bounds, demonstrating the tightness of our results. Finally, we characterize
the class of $\alpha$-approximately convex functions and show that our results
apply to a broad family of problems.

TL;DR: CARTRIDGE方法通过离线训练大幅压缩KV缓存（最高减少40倍内存使用），本文首次机制性探索发现：键向量作为稳定的检索路由器，值向量承担主要压缩功能，并提出SCI初始化方法加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文LLM推理的瓶颈在于KV缓存线性增长，需要探索CARTRIDGE压缩机制的内部工作原理以优化性能。

Method: 通过实证分析CARTRIDGE键值向量的功能分工，提出键向量作为检索路由器、值向量负责压缩的理论，并设计Sampled Chunk Initialization初始化方法。

Result: 实验证明CARTRIDGE键向量在不同任务间可互换使用而性能损失很小，SCI初始化能加快训练收敛速度。

Conclusion: 揭示了CARTRIDGE机制的工作原理，为后续优化和扩展提供了理论基础，SCI方法有望进一步提升训练效率。

Abstract: A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache.
Recent work has proposed CARTRIDGES, an approach which leverages offline
compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full
document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we
present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value
cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as
stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of
the learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present
empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and
model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors
between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight
improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We
suggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously
demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader
empirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for
further scaling.

*Kiran Madhusudhanan,Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi,Jonas Sonntag,Maximilian Stubbemann,Lars Schmidt-Thieme*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabResFlow是一种用于表格回归的归一化样条流模型，通过灵活的密度估计和不确定性建模，在多个基准数据集上超越了现有概率回归方法，并在推理速度上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格回归方法主要关注点估计，容易产生过度自信的预测，而现有概率方法通常假设固定形状分布（如高斯分布），无法处理现实世界中复杂的分布形态。

Method: TabResFlow包含三个核心组件：MLP数值特征编码器、全连接ResNet骨干网络用于特征提取，以及条件样条归一化流进行灵活可处理的密度估计。

Result: 在9个公共基准数据集上，TabResFlow相比最强概率回归模型TreeFlow有9.64%的提升，相比最强深度学习替代方案NodeFlow推理速度平均提升5.6倍，并在二手车价格预测任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: TabResFlow为表格回归提供了有效的概率建模解决方案，能够处理复杂的目标分布，在准确性和效率方面都优于现有方法，具有重要的工业应用价值。

Abstract: Tabular regression is a well-studied problem with numerous industrial
applications, yet most existing approaches focus on point estimation, often
leading to overconfident predictions. This issue is particularly critical in
industrial automation, where trustworthy decision-making is essential.
Probabilistic regression models address this challenge by modeling prediction
uncertainty. However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape
distribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution
parameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target
distributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
TabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for
univariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like
RealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow
consists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical
feature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature
extraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and
tractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark
datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic
regression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64%
improvement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model
(TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the
strongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the
practical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction
task under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we
introduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that
TabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.

Motivation: 解决传统二叉搜索树在哈希中的指数增长和稀疏性问题，提升大规模数据近似近邻搜索效率；整合决策树和提升方法的优势来降低泛化误差；解决癌症基因组学中突变解释的挑战。

Method: 1. ComBI：压缩二叉搜索树和倒排哈希表结合，实现快速近似近邻搜索

Conclusion: 这些方法为大规模数据分析和生物医学应用提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的工具，特别在癌症基因组学和患者生存预测方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: This thesis develops computational methods in similarity-preserving hashing,
classification, and cancer genomics. Standard space partitioning-based hashing
relies on Binary Search Trees (BSTs), but their exponential growth and sparsity
hinder efficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Compressed BST of Inverted
hash tables (ComBI), which enables fast approximate nearest-neighbor search
with reduced memory. On datasets of up to one billion samples, ComBI achieves
0.90 precision with 4X-296X speed-ups over Multi-Index Hashing, and also
outperforms Cellfishing.jl on single-cell RNA-seq searches with 2X-13X gains.
Building on hashing structures, we propose Guided Random Forest (GRAF), a
tree-based ensemble classifier that integrates global and local partitioning,
bridging decision trees and boosting while reducing generalization error.
Across 115 datasets, GRAF delivers competitive or superior accuracy, and its
unsupervised variant (uGRAF) supports guided hashing and importance sampling.
We show that GRAF and ComBI can be used to estimate per-sample classifiability,
which enables scalable prediction of cancer patient survival. To address
challenges in interpreting mutations, we introduce Continuous Representation of
Codon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning framework that embeds genetic changes
into numerical vectors. CRCS allows identification of somatic mutations without
matched normals, discovery of driver genes, and scoring of tumor mutations,
with survival prediction validated in bladder, liver, and brain cancers.
Together, these methods provide efficient, scalable, and interpretable tools
for large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可以应用于任何现有GNN架构，解码的理由结构能提供有意义的解释。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools on graph data. However, their
predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their
adoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new
uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines
graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our
method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a
probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is
conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation
matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the
rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient
model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the
well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is
general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive
experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty
quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show
that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式学习面临拜占庭故障和高通信成本的双重挑战，现有方法在结合通信压缩和拜占庭鲁棒聚合时存在性能下降问题

Method: 集成经典Polyak动量与新型协调压缩机制，仅假设诚实工作节点的平均损失函数Lipschitz平滑，无需额外的全局Hessian方差有界假设

Result: 在标准(G,B)梯度差异性异质性模型下性能与Byz-DASHA-PAGE相当，但在基准图像分类任务中实现了强鲁棒性和显著通信节省

Conclusion: RoSDHB算法在减少假设条件的同时，有效解决了分布式学习中拜占庭容错和通信效率的协同优化问题

Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) enables scalable model training over decentralized
data, but remains challenged by Byzantine faults and high communication costs.
While both issues have been studied extensively in isolation, their interaction
is less explored. Prior work shows that naively combining communication
compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty
nodes (or workers). The state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Byz-DASHA-PAGE [29],
makes use of the momentum variance reduction scheme to mitigate the detrimental
impact of compression noise on Byzantine-robustness. We propose a new
algorithm, named RoSDHB, that integrates the classic Polyak's momentum with a
new coordinated compression mechanism. We show that RoSDHB performs comparably
to Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard (G, B)-gradient dissimilarity
heterogeneity model, while it relies on fewer assumptions. In particular, we
only assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest
workers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of
bounded global Hessian variance. Empirical results on benchmark image
classification task show that RoSDHB achieves strong robustness with
significant communication savings.

TL;DR: MoE-Beyond是一个基于学习的专家激活预测器，通过训练轻量级transformer模型来预测MoE模型在推理时的专家激活模式，显著提高了GPU缓存命中率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MoE模型在边缘设备部署面临内存限制挑战，传统启发式专家缓存策略在模型参数扩展时难以维持高缓存命中率

Method: 将任务构建为多标签序列预测问题，使用从DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE提取的6600万专家激活轨迹训练轻量级transformer模型

Result: 在WebGLM-QA数据集上达到97.5%准确率和86.6% F1分数，当仅10%专家适合GPU缓存时，将缓存命中率从17%提升到72%

Conclusion: MoE-Beyond通过学习专家激活模式，有效解决了MoE模型在资源受限环境中的内存管理问题，显著优于传统启发式方法

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices
presents significant challenges due to memory constraints. While MoE
architectures enable efficient utilization of computational resources by
activating only a subset of experts per inference, they require careful memory
management to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity
struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models parameters scale. In this
work, we introduce MoE-Beyond, a learning-based expert activation predictor
trained to predict expert activations during autoregressive decoding. By
framing the task as a multi-label sequence prediction problem, we train a
lightweight transformer model on 66 million expert activation traces extracted
from LDJnr-Puffin dataset [5] using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE. Our predictor
generalizes effectively across unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset [6],
achieving 97.5% accuracy and an 86.6% F1-score. Simulation results show that
MoE-Beyond improves GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% when only 10% of experts
fit in GPU cache, outperforming heuristic baselines.

TL;DR: 论文研究有限和优化问题中策略性检索对求解性能的改善，提出了理想化的OGQ算法和实用的SGQ算法，通过异质性偏差选择来提升过渡状态性能和降低稳态方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究统一检索策略与策略性检索在有限和优化问题中的性能差异，通过适当的检索策略可以在每次迭代仅进行一次查询的前提下提升过渡状态性能。

Method: 提出了两种算法：1) OGQ（理想化算法）：每次选择预期改善最大的用户梯度；2) SGQ（实用算法）：在不假设全部梯度信息的情况下实现策略性检索。在满足Polyak-Lojasiewicz条件的平滑目标函数下进行分析。

Result: 理论分析表明：在预期改善异质性偏差假设下，OGQ能够提升过渡状态性能并降低稳态方差，SGQ在过渡状态性能方面超过SGD。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 策略性检索能够在仅进行单次查询的前提下显著提升有限和优化问题的过渡状态性能，SGQ算法提供了一种实用的实现方案。

Abstract: This paper considers a finite-sum optimization problem under first-order
queries and investigates the benefits of strategic querying on stochastic
gradient-based methods compared to uniform querying strategy. We first
introduce Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ), an idealized algorithm that selects
one user's gradient yielding the largest possible expected improvement (EI) at
each step. However, OGQ assumes oracle access to the gradients of all users to
make such a selection, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address
this limitation, we propose Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ), a practical
algorithm that has better transient-state performance than SGD while making
only one query per iteration. For smooth objective functions satisfying the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, we show that under the assumption of EI
heterogeneity, OGQ enhances transient-state performance and reduces
steady-state variance, while SGQ improves transient-state performance over SGD.
Our numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely used in various applications, with
density-based methods such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) being particularly prominent. These algorithms identify
clusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise.
However, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization
challenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel
density-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention,
which minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions.
Initially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters. If
parameter adjustment is needed, the method simplifies the process by
introducing a single integer parameter that is straightforward to tune. The
approach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed
points and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then
reintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental
evaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust
performance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based
clustering tasks.

Conclusion: CIFR基准测试和探测器监控方法为微调API安全防御提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据已开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning APIs enable widespread model customization,
yet pose significant safety risks. Recent work shows that adversaries can
exploit access to these APIs to bypass model safety mechanisms by encoding
harmful content in seemingly harmless fine-tuning data, evading both human
monitoring and standard content filters. We formalize the fine-tuning API
defense problem, and introduce the Cipher Fine-tuning Robustness benchmark
(CIFR), a benchmark for evaluating defense strategies' ability to retain model
safety in the face of cipher-enabled attackers while achieving the desired
level of fine-tuning functionality. We include diverse cipher encodings and
families, with some kept exclusively in the test set to evaluate for
generalization across unseen ciphers and cipher families. We then evaluate
different defenses on the benchmark and train probe monitors on model internal
activations from multiple fine-tunes. We show that probe monitors achieve over
99% detection accuracy, generalize to unseen cipher variants and families, and
compare favorably to state-of-the-art monitoring approaches. We open-source
CIFR and the code to reproduce our experiments to facilitate further research
in this critical area. Code and data are available online

Conclusion: ONG通过结合自然梯度和正交投影，在保持先前任务性能的同时，在信息几何结构下实现了更优的收敛性能。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient descent has emerged as a powerful method for continual
learning tasks. However, its Euclidean projections overlook the underlying
information-geometric structure of the space of distributions parametrized by
neural networks, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To
counteract this, we combine it with the idea of the natural gradient and
present ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent). ONG preconditions each new
task gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher
information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction
under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks,
ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior
task gradients. We provide a theoretical justification for this procedure,
introduce the ONG algorithm, and benchmark its performance on the Permuted and
Rotated MNIST datasets. All code for our experiments/reproducibility can be
found at https://github.com/yajatyadav/orthogonal-natural-gradient.

TL;DR: 提出SaGD框架，通过平滑对抗训练的尖锐损失景观来改善OOD检测，在对抗攻击下能准确区分对抗性ID样本和真实OOD样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法将对抗性ID样本误判为OOD样本，且在对抗攻击下的ID和OOD数据检测研究较少

Method: 使用Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense框架，通过Jitter-based扰动在对抗训练中平滑损失景观，提高几何嵌入收敛性

Result: 在CIFAR-100与6个OOD数据集的各种攻击下，SaGD显著改善了FPR和AUC指标，优于现有防御方法

Conclusion: 平滑对抗训练的尖锐损失景观有助于提升对抗性OOD检测性能，揭示了尖锐损失景观与对抗OOD检测之间的关系

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection ensures safe and reliable model
deployment. Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect
OOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However,
this setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD
predictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under
attacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method
that distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss
landscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting
the latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce
a {\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the
rugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced
geometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization,
benefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks. We use Jitter-based
perturbation in adversarial training to extend the defense ability against
unseen attacks. Our SaGD framework significantly improves FPR and AUC over the
state-of-the-art defense approaches in differentiating CIFAR-100 from six other
OOD datasets under various attacks. We further examine the effects of
perturbations at various adversarial training levels, revealing the
relationship between the sharp loss landscape and adversarial OOD detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络难以捕捉节点间的长距离依赖关系，而图transformer通过注意力机制实现全局信息交换，但存在密集和稀疏两种注意力机制需要对比分析

Method: 对比分析密集注意力和稀疏注意力机制的性能差异和计算效率，探讨各自的适用场景

Result: 明确了两种注意力机制各自的优势和局限性，提供了选择指导原则

Conclusion: 图transformer的注意力机制设计需要根据具体任务需求在计算效率和表达能力之间进行权衡，未来需要解决可扩展性和理论分析等挑战

Abstract: Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing
relational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural
networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to
their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention
mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there
are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this
paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and
highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in
designing attention for graph transformers.

TL;DR: 通过机制解释方法研究LLM过于自信的内部机制，发现高自信表征可分解为情绪和逻辑两个正交子组件，与心理学双途径模型相并行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险场景中常展现过于自信的行为，以不应该的确定性呈现信息，需要研究其内部机制基础。

Method: 使用基于人工标注自信数据集微调的Llama 3.2模型，提取所有层的殊活动值，通过相似性指标定位自信表征。

Result: 识别出对自信对比最敏感的层，发现高自信表征可分解为情绪和逻辑两个正交子组件。导向向量展现不同的因果效应：情绪向量广泛影响预测准确性，逻辑向量产生更局部的效应。

Conclusion: 研究提供了LLM自信多组件结构的机制证据，为减缓过于自信行为指明了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting
information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate
the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using
open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness
datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute
similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis
identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that
high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of
emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration
Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these
sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly
influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized
effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component
structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating
overconfident behavior.

Motivation: 现有LLM通过增加测试时计算来提升推理能力，但带来了显著的延迟和资源成本，限制了在实时或成本敏感场景的应用

Method: 在推理时定期插入特殊控制令牌告知剩余令牌预算，采用两阶段训练：SFT让模型熟悉预算约束，基于课程的RL使用长度感知奖励函数优化准确性和预算遵守

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，BudgetThinker在各种推理预算下显著超越强基线，保持性能

Conclusion: 该方法为开发高效可控的LLM推理提供了可扩展解决方案，使先进模型更适用于资源受限和实时环境

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased
test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while
effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their
applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This
paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with
budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their
thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special
control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its
remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage
training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize
the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement
Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize
for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker
significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a
variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method
provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and
controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for
deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

Motivation: 医疗视觉-语言模型通过RAG增强事实基础，但这种外部检索依赖创造了新的攻击面。需要系统性地探索医疗RAG系统的漏洞。

Method: 构建模拟半开放攻击环境，提出跨模态冲突注入(CMCI)技术，在医学图像和报告中注入细微的语义矛盾，同时保持合理性以避免被过滤。

Result: 在IU-Xray和MIMIC-CXR QA任务上，MedThreatRAG导致回答F1分数最高降低27.66%，LLaVA-Med-1.5的F1率降至51.36%。CMCI攻击效果最严重。

Conclusion: 医疗RAG系统存在根本性安全空漏，强调了威胁意识设计和健壮多模态一致性检查的紧迫性，并提出了安全开发指南。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual
grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this
reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel
multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in
medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation
of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack
environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic
knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting,
we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds
subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.
These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal
alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters.
While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI
demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR
QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and
lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose
fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need
for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we
conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of
future multimodal medical RAG systems.

Motivation: 随着城市车辆数量快速增长，现有道路基础设施难以满足现代交通需求，导致拥堵问题。现有导航模型大多只关注确定性或时间依赖网络，忽略了交通流的关联性和随机性特征。

Method: 提出了一种路径规划解决方案，将决策Transformer与广义策略梯度(GPG)框架相结合。利用决策Transformer建模长期依赖关系的能力，提高路径决策的准确性和稳定性。

Result: 在Sioux Falls网络上的实验结果表明，该方法在准时到达概率方面优于之前的基线方法，提供了更准确的路径规划解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合决策Transformer和GPG框架，有效解决了随机交通网络中的可靠最短路径问题，为城市交通拥堵问题提供了更优的路径规划策略。

Abstract: With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road
infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in
the issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path
planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on
deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations
and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the
reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under
certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the
decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework.
Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies,
our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions.
Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our
approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival
probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.

Conclusion: 提出的理论框架和优化方法为双曲神经网络的曲率学习提供了有效解决方案，显著改善了模型泛化能力

Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in
representing real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the
geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures.
Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may
cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.
So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not
been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of
HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via
their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived
bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the
loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized
through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit
differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by
approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and
convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation
error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding
gradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from
long-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our
method can improve the performance of HNNs.

Abstract: Transformer has become fundamental to a vast series of pre-trained large
models that have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications.
Machine unlearning, which focuses on efficiently removing specific data
influences to comply with privacy regulations, shows promise in restricting
updates to influence-critical parameters. However, existing parameter-efficient
unlearning methods are largely devised in a module-oblivious manner, which
tends to inaccurately identify these parameters and leads to inferior
unlearning performance for Transformers. In this paper, we propose {\tt
MAPE-Unlearn}, a module-aware parameter-efficient machine unlearning approach
that uses a learnable pair of masks to pinpoint influence-critical parameters
in the heads and filters of Transformers. The learning objective of these masks
is derived by desiderata of unlearning and optimized through an efficient
algorithm featured by a greedy search with a warm start. Extensive experiments
on various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of {\tt MAPE-Unlearn} for unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络参数数量远超训练样本但仍能良好泛化，经典复杂度度量（如VC维、PAC-Bayes边界）在此过参数化机制中失效，需要新的理论解释。

Method: 基于注意力矩阵的有效秩来定义模型容量，分析注意力机制的功能维度而非原始参数数量，推导出新的泛化边界。

Result: 提出的有效秩度量方法得到的泛化边界在样本量依赖关系上与大型语言模型的经验缩放定律一致（最多相差对数因子）。

Conclusion: 注意力矩阵的谱性质而非原始参数数量可能是理解过参数化模型泛化能力的关键视角，虽然这还不是完整的过参数化学习理论，但提供了重要证据。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often contain far more parameters than training
examples, yet they still manage to generalize well in practice. Classical
complexity measures such as VC-dimension or PAC-Bayes bounds usually become
vacuous in this overparameterized regime, offering little explanation for the
empirical success of models like Transformers. In this work, I explore an
alternative notion of capacity for attention-based models, based on the
effective rank of their attention matrices. The intuition is that, although the
parameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is
often much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound
whose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in
large language models, up to logarithmic factors. While the analysis is not a
complete theory of overparameterized learning, it provides evidence that
spectral properties of attention, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the
right lens for understanding why these models generalize.

Abstract: . Predicting and calculating the aerodynamic coefficients of airfoils near
the ground with CFD software requires much time. However, the availability of
data from CFD simulation results and the development of new neural network
methods have made it possible to present the simulation results using methods
like VGG, a CCN neural network method. In this article, lift-to-drag
coefficients of airfoils near the ground surface are predicted with the help of
a neural network. This prediction can only be realized by providing data for
training and learning the code that contains information on the lift-to-drag
ratio of the primary data and images related to the airfoil cross-section,
which are converted into a matrix. One advantage of the VGG method over other
methods is that its results are more accurate than those of other CNN methods.

Motivation: 深度学习在心律失常检测中虽然准确率高，但可解释性不足阻碍了临床应用，需要研究适用于时间序列ECG分析的XAI技术。

Method: 使用MIT-BIH心律失常数据集和额外的12导联ECG数据集，构建卷积神经网络模型，并对比四种SHAP基础的XAI方法：排列重要性、KernelSHAP、梯度基础方法和DeepLIFT。

Result: 模型在MIT-BIH上获得98.3%的验证准确率，但在结合数据集上性能下降。梯度基础和DeepLIFT方法能够显示与临床推理一致的波形区域，而排列重要性和KernelSHAP产生了杂乱的可视化输出。

Conclusion: 研究强调了ECG分析中领域特定XAI适配的必要性，并确认显著性地图方法作为更具临床直观性的解释方法。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have enabled highly accurate arrhythmia
detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, but limited interpretability
remains a barrier to clinical adoption. This study investigates the application
of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically adapted for time-series ECG
analysis. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, a convolutional neural
network-based model was developed for arrhythmia classification, with
R-peak-based segmentation via the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To increase the
dataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset
was incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind
of explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical
professionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over
counterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG
interpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based
approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and
Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The
model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance
degradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability
challenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual
outputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions
consistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples.
Findings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis
and highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核反应堆材料在高温循环载荷和辐照条件下会发生复杂退化，传统经验模型无法准确预测其疲劳寿命，需要开发更精确的预测方法。

Method: 开发PINN模型，在损失函数中融入物理疲劳寿命约束，使用495个数据点（包括辐照和未辐照条件）进行训练。

Result: PINN模型在预测精度上优于随机森林、梯度提升、XGBoost和传统神经网络，SHAP分析显示应变幅值、辐照剂量和测试温度是主要影响因素。

Conclusion: PINN框架为预测辐照合金疲劳寿命提供了可靠且可解释的方法，有助于材料选择和设计决策。

Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to
predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and
ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. These materials
experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing
complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture
accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life
constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and
generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and
unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning
models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and
the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis
identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as
dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with
physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at
higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a
reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated
alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器使用固定稀疏度约束，无法适应不同输入的复杂度变化，需要一种能够根据输入语义复杂度动态调整特征分配的方法。

Method: 利用线性探针证明上下文复杂度在线性编码在LLM表示中，并以此信号指导训练过程中的特征分配，动态调整稀疏度水平。

Result: 在Pythia-70M、Pythia-160M和Gemma-2-2B三个语言模型上的实验表明，该方法在重建保真度、解释方差和余弦相似度指标上显著优于固定稀疏度方法，同时消除了大量超参数调优的计算负担。

Conclusion: 基于复杂度的自适应稀疏自编码器框架为LLM内部表示的可解释性研究提供了更有效的解决方案，能够更好地捕捉不同输入语义复杂度的特征表示。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs)
remains a central challenge for interpretability research. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) offer a promising solution by decomposing activations into interpretable
features, but existing approaches rely on fixed sparsity constraints that fail
to account for input complexity. We propose Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders
(AdaptiveK), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts sparsity levels based
on the semantic complexity of each input. Leveraging linear probes, we
demonstrate that context complexity is linearly encoded in LLM representations,
and we use this signal to guide feature allocation during training. Experiments
across three language models (Pythia-70M, Pythia-160M, and Gemma-2-2B)
demonstrate that this complexity-driven adaptation significantly outperforms
fixed-sparsity approaches on reconstruction fidelity, explained variance, and
cosine similarity metrics while eliminating the computational burden of
extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Motivation: 研究神经网络在弯曲域（如球面）上的频率相关学习动态，特别是频率原则（FP）在球面几何中的表现和局限性。

Method: 使用球谐函数展开分析固定和可训练权重情况下的学习动态，通过数值实验验证理论分析。

Result: 固定权重时谐波系数以O(ℓ^{5/2}/2^ℓ)衰减，可训练权重时衰减阶数为O(ℓ^{7/2}/2^ℓ)，通常导致低频优先学习，但特定条件下FP可能被违反。

Conclusion: 频率原则在球面等弯曲域上应被视为学习趋势而非绝对规则，权重方向更新和球谐展开共同塑造了频率依赖的学习行为。

Abstract: We investigate the learning dynamics of shallow ReLU neural networks on the
unit sphere \(S^2\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) in polar coordinates \((\tau,\phi)\),
considering both fixed and trainable neuron directions \(\{w_i\}\). For fixed
weights, spherical harmonic expansions reveal an intrinsic low-frequency
preference with coefficients decaying as \(O(\ell^{5/2}/2^\ell)\), typically
leading to the Frequency Principle (FP) of lower-frequency-first learning.
However, this principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or
error distributions. With trainable weights, an additional rotation term in the
harmonic evolution equations preserves exponential decay with decay order
\(O(\ell^{7/2}/2^\ell)\) factor, also leading to the FP of
lower-frequency-first learning. But like fixed weights case, the principle can
be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. Our
numerical results demonstrate that trainable directions increase learning
complexity and can either maintain a low-frequency advantage or enable faster
high-frequency emergence. This analysis suggests the FP should be viewed as a
tendency rather than a rule on curved domains like \(S^2\), providing insights
into how direction updates and harmonic expansions shape frequency-dependent
learning.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex

lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25\%
reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while
maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results
highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally

inspired by progressive candidate pruning. SLM operates on simplex centroids,
reducing generation complexity and enhancing scalability. Additionally, SLM
incorporates a flexible implementation of classifier-free guidance, enhancing

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文发现大型语言模型在代码分析中存在抽象偏见漏洞，攻击者可通过熟悉模式攻击（FPA）利用最小代码编辑来误导模型判断，该攻击具有跨模型和跨语言的通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs被广泛用于自动化代码审查和静态分析，需要识别其潜在的安全漏洞，特别是模型可能因过度泛化熟悉编程模式而忽略细微错误的抽象偏见问题。

Method: 开发了全自动黑盒算法来发现和注入熟悉模式攻击（FPA），通过在目标代码中进行最小编辑来利用模型的抽象偏见，而不影响实际运行时行为。

Result: FPA攻击对GPT-4o、Claude 3.5、Gemini 2.0等多种模型有效，且具有跨Python、C、Rust、Go等编程语言的通用性，即使使用强化系统提示警告模型也仍然有效。

Conclusion: FPA攻击揭示了代码导向LLMs的可靠性问题，同时也探讨了该技术的防御性应用前景，对LLM代码分析的安全性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated
code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as
vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we
identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an
abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming
patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this
blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal
edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as
a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).
  We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects
FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective,
but also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and
universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs
remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via
robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and
discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of
code-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: ShaLa是一个新颖的多模态生成框架，通过整合创新的架构推理模型和扩散先验，解决了多模态VAE在共享潜在表示学习和合成质量方面的挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的多模态方法往往过度关注模态特定的细节，而忽略了跨模态共享的高层语义概念。多模态VAE虽然旨在捕获共享表示，但在表达性联合变分后验设计和合成质量方面存在困难。

Method: ShaLa整合了新颖的架构推理模型和第二阶段表达性扩散先验，既促进了共享潜在表示的有效推理，又显著提高了下游多模态合成的质量。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了ShaLa的优越性，相比最先进的多模态VAE，表现出更好的连贯性和合成质量，并且能够扩展到更多模态。

Conclusion: ShaLa框架成功解决了多模态VAE的关键挑战，在共享潜在表示学习和多模态合成方面取得了显著改进，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative framework for learning shared latent
representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus
on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which
can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared
across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent
variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various
tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However,
multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational
posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses
these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a
second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective
inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the
quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis
quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales
to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in
capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.

TL;DR: FedERL是首个在联邦学习中同时解决客户端时间/能耗约束和抗数据损坏鲁棒性的方法，通过服务器端数据无关鲁棒训练实现零客户端开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临客户端计算资源受限和缺乏对常见数据损坏（噪声、模糊、天气效应）鲁棒性的挑战，现有鲁棒训练方法计算成本高且不适合资源受限的客户端。

Method: 提出FedERL框架，核心是服务器端的数据无关鲁棒训练（DART）方法，无需访问训练数据即可增强模型鲁棒性，确保客户端零鲁棒性开销。

Result: 大量实验表明FedERL能以传统方法一小部分的时间和能耗成本处理常见数据损坏，在有限时间和能耗预算下性能超越传统鲁棒训练方法。

Conclusion: FedERL是联邦学习中实用且可扩展的解决方案，特别适合现实世界的联邦学习应用场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) accelerates the deployment of deep learning models on
edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL systems face challenges
due to client-side constraints on computational resources, and from a lack of
robustness to common corruptions such as noise, blur, and weather effects.
Existing robust training methods are computationally expensive and unsuitable
for resource-constrained clients. We propose FedERL, federated efficient and
robust learning, as the first work to explicitly address corruption robustness
under time and energy constraints on the client side. At its core, FedERL
employs a novel data-agnostic robust training (DART) method on the server to
enhance robustness without access to the training data. In doing so, FedERL
ensures zero robustness overhead for clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate
FedERL's ability to handle common corruptions at a fraction of the time and
energy cost of traditional robust training methods. In scenarios with limited
time and energy budgets, FedERL surpasses the performance of traditional robust
training, establishing it as a practical and scalable solution for real-world
FL applications.

Conclusion: 这项工作显示了显式推理在图学习中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新的资源和方向。

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-pecific supervision remains
challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces,
while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent
advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via
explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a
GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link
prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by
LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these
tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages
task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs.
Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work
highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides
new resources for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多关系图聚类方法要么因异构图结构和属性融合效果差而导致结果质量严重受损，要么因采用复杂昂贵的深度学习模型而难以处理大规模图数据。

Method: 基于新颖的两阶段优化目标：第一阶段通过优化多关系Dirichlet能量获得高质量节点特征向量，第二阶段在节点亲和图上最小化聚类结果的Dirichlet能量。DEMM+通过高效近似求解器和理论驱动的问题转换实现线性时间聚类。

Result: 在11个真实多关系图上与20个基线方法对比，DEMM+在聚类质量方面持续优于其他方法，且通常显著更快。

Conclusion: DEMM+方法在多关系图聚类任务中实现了优异的聚类质量和高效的可扩展性，能够有效处理大规模图数据。

Abstract: Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling
diverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade
extensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning
the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in
analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the
majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised
result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and
attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and
billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning
models.
  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to
address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel
two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive
high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet
energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of
clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves
significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM
through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions
include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node
feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with
carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without
explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend
DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive
experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit
that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured
against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.

retrieval scores across retrieval tasks. Finally, we highlight the implications
this has for the development of LLM-based retrievers.

Motivation: 现有自主实验系统缺乏检测和适应意外情况的机制，传统惊奇度量只能检测瞬时偏差而无法捕捉系统是否真正在学习适应

Method: 引入互信息惊奇(MIS)框架，量化新观测对互信息的影响；开发统计测试序列检测互信息的有意义变化；提出MISRP策略通过采样调整和进程分叉动态控制系统行为

Result: 在合成领域和动态污染图估计任务中，MISRP治理的策略在稳定性、响应性和预测准确性方面显著优于基于传统惊奇的方法

Conclusion: 通过将惊奇从反应性转向反思性，MIS为更自我意识和自适应的自主系统提供了路径

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated
remarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains
limited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core
limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the
unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or
Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture
whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce
Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not
as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the
impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems
to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test
sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and
propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically
governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.
Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map
estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform
classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and
predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS
offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风险评估框架无法应对对抗性机器学习(AML)带来的独特挑战，现有AML评估方法主要关注技术攻击鲁棒性，忽略了部署环境、系统依赖和攻击可行性等关键现实因素。

Method: FRAME包含新颖的风险评估方法，系统评估三个关键维度：目标系统部署环境、多样化AML技术特征、先前研究的实证见解。采用可行性评分机制和基于LLM的系统特定评估定制，并开发了全面的结构化AML攻击数据集。

Result: 在六个不同的真实世界应用中进行验证，表现出卓越的准确性和与AML专家分析的高度一致性。

Conclusion: FRAME使组织能够优先处理AML风险，支持在真实环境中安全部署AI系统，为系统所有者提供可直接使用的 actionable 结果。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) systems increased attention
to their security and emergence of adversarial machine learning (AML)
techniques that exploit fundamental vulnerabilities in ML systems, creating an
urgent need for comprehensive risk assessment for ML-based systems. While
traditional risk assessment frameworks evaluate conventional cybersecurity
risks, they lack ability to address unique challenges posed by AML threats.
Existing AML threat evaluation approaches focus primarily on technical attack
robustness, overlooking crucial real-world factors like deployment
environments, system dependencies, and attack feasibility. Attempts at
comprehensive AML risk assessment have been limited to domain-specific
solutions, preventing application across diverse systems. Addressing these
limitations, we present FRAME, the first comprehensive and automated framework
for assessing AML risks across diverse ML-based systems. FRAME includes a novel
risk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating
three key dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics
of diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. FRAME
incorporates a feasibility scoring mechanism and LLM-based customization for
system-specific assessments. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive
structured dataset of AML attacks enabling context-aware risk assessment. From
an engineering application perspective, FRAME delivers actionable results
designed for direct use by system owners with only technical knowledge of their
systems, without expertise in AML. We validated it across six diverse
real-world applications. Our evaluation demonstrated exceptional accuracy and
strong alignment with analysis by AML experts. FRAME enables organizations to
prioritize AML risks, supporting secure AI deployment in real-world
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本学习中的欠拟合问题，在数据受限情况下提高模型表达能力，同时保持泛化性能

Method: 在损失函数中添加符号反转的奖励项，采用幂律衰减策略，结合投影算子和梯度裁剪的稳定性保障机制，在线性平滑器和NTK机制下进行分析

Result: 实验表明AR方法减少欠拟合，保持泛化能力，改善校准性能，在回归和分类任务中均有效

Conclusion: AR方法简单易实现，可集成到标准经验风险最小化流程中，在数据和资源受限环境下实现鲁棒学习

Abstract: We propose Anti-regularization (AR), which adds a sign-reversed reward term
to the loss to intentionally increase model expressivity in the small-sample
regime, and then attenuates this intervention with a power-law decay as the
sample size grows. We formalize spectral safety and trust-region conditions,
and design a lightweight stability safeguard that combines a projection
operator with gradient clipping, ensuring stable intervention under stated
assumptions. Our analysis spans linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) regime, providing practical guidance on selecting the decay exponent by
balancing empirical risk against variance. Empirically, AR reduces underfitting
while preserving generalization and improving calibration in both regression
and classification. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and the
stability safeguard are critical to preventing overfitting and numerical
instability. We further examine a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that
keeps per-sample complexity approximately constant. AR is simple to implement
and reproducible, integrating cleanly into standard empirical risk minimization
pipelines. It enables robust learning in data- and resource-constrained
settings by intervening only when beneficial and fading away when unnecessary.

Conclusion: MMF提供了一个灵活且理论完备的框架，能够高效生成高质量样本，同时避免了昂贵的高阶导数计算，在多个任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: One-step generative modeling seeks to generate high-quality data samples in a
single function evaluation, significantly improving efficiency over traditional
diffusion or flow-based models. In this work, we introduce Modular MeanFlow
(MMF), a flexible and theoretically grounded approach for learning
time-averaged velocity fields. Our method derives a family of loss functions
based on a differential identity linking instantaneous and average velocities,
and incorporates a gradient modulation mechanism that enables stable training
without sacrificing expressiveness. We further propose a curriculum-style
warmup schedule to smoothly transition from coarse supervision to fully
differentiable training. The MMF formulation unifies and generalizes existing
consistency-based and flow-matching methods, while avoiding expensive
higher-order derivatives. Empirical results across image synthesis and
trajectory modeling tasks demonstrate that MMF achieves competitive sample
quality, robust convergence, and strong generalization, particularly under
low-data or out-of-distribution settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement
learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems,
but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of
diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a
self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a
tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and
fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update
compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key
contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates
the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along
with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage
estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.
and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic
divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain
of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours
from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile
showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level
sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of
inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based
post-training with fewer samples and less compute. Home page locates at

Conclusion: RRPO有效解决了鲁棒约束RL中的对偶性限制问题，为处理模型不确定性和安全约束提供了可行的原始方法

Abstract: The goal of robust constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize an
agent's performance under the worst-case model uncertainty while satisfying
safety or resource constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that strong
duality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that
traditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called
Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the
primal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical
convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence
to an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching
the best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a
specific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the
effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe
performance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate
the worst-case safety constraints.

Conclusion: ReviBranch展示了在异构MILP问题类别间的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为解决分支变量选择问题提供了有效的深度强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: The Branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer
Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential
to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching
often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing
learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence
on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with
limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To
address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that
constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences
between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along
search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from
complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching
process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward
redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense
stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive
experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch
outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP
iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the
robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem
classes.

Abstract: Classification in the context of multi-label data streams represents a
challenge that has attracted significant attention due to its high real-world
applicability. However, this task faces problems inherent to dynamic
environments, such as the continuous arrival of data at high speed and volume,
changes in the data distribution (concept drift), the emergence of new labels
(concept evolution), and the latency in the arrival of ground truth labels.
This systematic literature review presents an in-depth analysis of multi-label
data stream classification proposals. We characterize the latest methods in the
literature, providing a comprehensive overview, building a thorough hierarchy,
and discussing how the proposals approach each problem. Furthermore, we discuss
the adopted evaluation strategies and analyze the methods' asymptotic
complexity and resource consumption. Finally, we identify the main gaps and
offer recommendations for future research directions in the field.

### [328] [Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17456)
*Liv Gorton,Owen Lewis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出叠加(superposition)可能是对抗样本现象的主要成因，通过理论分析、玩具模型实验和ResNet18实验提供了四方面证据支持这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗样本作为深度学习中最令人困惑的现象之一，近十年来缺乏共识性的根本机制解释。叠加这一机制可解释性概念可能是主要原因，但尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过四个证据链进行验证：(1)理论分析叠加解释对抗现象的能力；(2)在玩具模型中通过干预叠加来控制鲁棒性；(3)在玩具模型中通过对抗训练干预鲁棒性来控制叠加；(4)在ResNet18中通过对抗训练干预鲁棒性来控制叠加。

Result: 研究证实叠加确实能够解释多种对抗现象，并且在玩具模型和真实神经网络中，叠加与鲁棒性之间存在双向因果关系。

Conclusion: 叠加很可能是对抗样本现象的主要成因，这一发现为理解对抗性脆弱性提供了新的机制解释视角，并扩展了Elhage等人先前的工作。

Abstract: Adversarial examples -- inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool
neural networks -- remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena
despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations
have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One
underexplored hypothesis is that superposition, a concept from mechanistic
interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary
cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly
extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can
theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models,
intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models,
intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition,
and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training)
controls superposition.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have enabled the scaling of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) by achieving massive parameter
counts while maintaining computational efficiency. However, MoEs introduce
several inference-time challenges, including load imbalance across experts and
the additional routing computational overhead. To address these challenges and
fully harness the benefits of MoE, a systematic evaluation of hardware
acceleration techniques is essential. We present MoE-Inference-Bench, a
comprehensive study to evaluate MoE performance across diverse scenarios. We
analyze the impact of batch size, sequence length, and critical MoE
hyperparameters such as FFN dimensions and number of experts on throughput. We
evaluate several optimization techniques on Nvidia H100 GPUs, including
pruning, Fused MoE operations, speculative decoding, quantization, and various
parallelization strategies. Our evaluation includes MoEs from the Mixtral,
DeepSeek, OLMoE and Qwen families. The results reveal performance differences
across configurations and provide insights for the efficient deployment of
MoEs.

*Martin Käppel,Julian Neuberger,Felix Möhrlein,Sven Weinzierl,Martin Matzner,Stefan Jablonski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的模型无关方法，通过人在循环方式识别和纠正预测性过程监控模型中的偏见决策，并在敏感属性同时被公平和不公平使用的情况下保持准确性与公平性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性过程监控模型虽然预测性能力强大，但容易受到数据中不公平、偏见或不道德模式的影响，导致基于敏感属性的偏见预测。但敏感属性在同一过程中可能同时被公平和不公平地使用，传统的删除敏感属性方法无法处理这种复杂情况。

Method: 提出了一种模型无关的方法，通过人在循环方式，使用从原始预测模型精炼出的决策树模型进行简单修改，来区分公平和不公平的决策。

Result: 结果显示，该方法在存在偏见数据的情况下，能够实现公平性和准确性之间的有前景的平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的方法来处理预测性过程监控模型中的偏见问题，特别是在敏感属性同时被公平和不公平使用的复杂场景下，为组织提供了更加公平的预测解决方案。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring enables organizations to proactively react and
intervene in running instances of a business process. Given an incomplete
process instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining
time are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have
shown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of
these models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical
patterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on
so-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process
participants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions
that mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process
instance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in
the same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment
decisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient
should not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic
approach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business
process monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both
fairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to
differentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a
decision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results
show that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness
and accuracy in the presence of biased data. All source code and data are

### [331] [Multimodal Representation Learning Conditioned on Semantic Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17497)
*Yang Qiao,Yuntong Hu,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RCML框架，通过自然语言关系描述指导多模态表示学习，解决了传统对比学习模型在语义关系利用、上下文对齐和模态内一致性方面的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习模型如CLIP存在三个主要问题：1)主要关注图像-文本对，未能充分利用不同对之间的语义关系；2)直接匹配全局嵌入而缺乏上下文化，忽视了特定子空间或关系维度的语义对齐需求；3)强调跨模态对比，对模态内一致性的支持有限

Method: RCML框架构建由语义关系连接的多样化训练对，引入关系引导的交叉注意力机制，在每种关系上下文中调节多模态表示。训练目标结合了跨模态和模态内对比损失

Result: 在不同数据集上的实验表明，RCML在检索和分类任务上均持续优于强基线方法

Conclusion: 利用语义关系指导多模态表示学习是有效的，RCML框架通过关系条件化学习显著提升了多模态表示的质量和性能

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive
models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space.
However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text
pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they
directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the
need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions;
and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for
intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose
Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns
multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to
guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs
many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a
relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal
representations under each relation context. The training objective combines
inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across
both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different
datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both
retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of
leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DLNs在时间序列分类(TSC)领域的应用潜力，特别是在保持准确性、可解释性和计算效率方面的优势。

Method: 使用Catch22和TSFresh特征提取方法将时间序列转换为向量表示，采用联合超参数搜索策略优化DLN训练配置。

Result: 在51个公开单变量TSC基准测试中，DLNs展现出竞争性的准确性、低推理成本和透明的决策逻辑。

Conclusion: DLNs在时间序列分类领域成功保持了其在表格数据中的核心优势，为TSC任务提供了准确、高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Differentiable logic networks (DLNs) have shown promising results in tabular
domains by combining accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
In this work, we apply DLNs to the domain of TSC for the first time, focusing
on univariate datasets. To enable DLN application in this context, we adopt
feature-based representations relying on Catch22 and TSFresh, converting
sequential time series into vectorized forms suitable for DLN classification.
Unlike prior DLN studies that fix the training configuration and vary various
settings in isolation via ablation, we integrate all such configurations into
the hyperparameter search space, enabling the search process to select jointly
optimal settings. We then analyze the distribution of selected configurations
to better understand DLN training dynamics. We evaluate our approach on 51
publicly available univariate TSC benchmarks. The results confirm that
classification DLNs maintain their core strengths in this new domain: they
deliver competitive accuracy, retain low inference cost, and provide
transparent, interpretable decision logic, thus aligning well with previous DLN
findings in the realm of tabular classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为实际时间序列预测应用提供了既准确又高效的解决方案，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: Accurate univariate forecasting remains a pressing need in real-world
systems, such as energy markets, hydrology, retail demand, and IoT monitoring,
where signals are often intermittent and horizons span both short- and
long-term. While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
increasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE
models typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting
loss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful
routing/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we
propose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for
univariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and
short-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines
sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that
replaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical
evaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced
expert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring
the auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE
implementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a
fraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models,
such as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that
our MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally
efficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling
cost-effective inference. These results highlight the potential of our approach
for practical time-series forecasting applications where both accuracy and
computational efficiency are critical.

Result: 在30个基准数据集和真实医疗数据集上验证，性能优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: TANDEM不仅提高了分类准确性，还为缺失数据处理提供了新见解，具有重要实用价值

Abstract: Handling missing data in time series classification remains a significant
challenge in various domains. Traditional methods often rely on imputation,
which may introduce bias or fail to capture the underlying temporal dynamics.
In this paper, we propose TANDEM (Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential
Equations for Missingness), an attention-guided neural differential equation
framework that effectively classifies time series data with missing values. Our
approach integrates raw observation, interpolated control path, and continuous
latent dynamics through a novel attention mechanism, allowing the model to
focus on the most informative aspects of the data. We evaluate TANDEM on 30
benchmark datasets and a real-world medical dataset, demonstrating its
superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our framework not only
improves classification accuracy but also provides insights into the handling
of missing data, making it a valuable tool in practice.

Conclusion: 神经随机延迟微分方程是在观测约束下进行时间序列分析的原理性和实用性工具

Abstract: Astronomical time series from large-scale surveys like LSST are often
irregularly sampled and incomplete, posing challenges for classification and
anomaly detection. We introduce a new framework based on Neural Stochastic
Delay Differential Equations (Neural SDDEs) that combines stochastic modeling
with neural networks to capture delayed temporal dynamics and handle irregular

numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse
sequences. Experiments on irregularly sampled astronomical data demonstrate
strong classification accuracy and effective detection of novel astrophysical
events, even with partial labels. This work highlights Neural SDDEs as a
principled and practical tool for time series analysis under observational
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为图同配性是MPNN性能的关键因素，但近期研究发现邻域类别分布的一致性更为重要。作者发现MPNN性能取决于类别内邻域分布组件的数量，需要解决邻域分布偏差问题。

Method: 提出Gumbel-Softmax重连方法，通过分解类别到邻域分布组件，减少邻域分布的偏差，增强邻域信息性并处理长程依赖。

Result: 新方法显著提升了邻域信息性，缓解了过度压缩问题，提高了MPNN的分类性能。

Conclusion: 基于Gumbel-Softmax的重连方法有效改善了MPNN在节点分类任务中的表现，特别是在处理复杂邻域分布和长程依赖方面表现出色。

Abstract: Graph homophily has been considered an essential property for message-passing
neural networks (MPNN) in node classification. Recent findings suggest that
performance is more closely tied to the consistency of neighborhood class
distributions. We demonstrate that the MPNN performance depends on the number
of components of the overall neighborhood distribution within a class. By
breaking down the classes into their neighborhood distribution components, we
increase measures of neighborhood distribution informativeness but do not
observe an improvement in MPNN performance. We propose a Gumbel-Softmax-based
rewiring method that reduces deviations in neighborhood distributions. Our
results show that our new method enhances neighborhood informativeness, handles
long-range dependencies, mitigates oversquashing, and increases the
classification performance of the MPNN. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解transformer残差流中特征的流动机制对于提高模型安全性、错误检测和修正至关重要，但目前这一动态过程研究不足

Method: 使用激活传输算子(ATO)作为上游到下游残差的线性映射，通过下游SAE解码器投影在特征空间评估，开发传输效率概念并估计线性传输对应的残差流子空间大小

Result: 经验证明ATO能够确定特征是从先前层线性传输还是从非线性层计算合成，报告了传输效率和线性传输涉及的残差流子空间大小

Conclusion: 这种计算轻量(无需微调，<50 GPU小时)的方法为安全性、调试提供了实用工具，并更清晰地展示了LLM中计算表现线性的位置

Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers
via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary
learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation
patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which
features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding
this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection
of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation
Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals
$k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder
projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine
whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or
synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of
transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to
estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear
transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport
efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear
transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers
practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where
computation in LLMs behaves linearly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer模型通过上下文提示实现算法模拟的能力，揭示GPT类基础模型如何仅通过提示切换不同算法的机制

Method: 构造将算法参数编码到token表示中的提示，创建尖锐的点积差距迫使softmax注意力遵循预定计算，无需前馈层或参数更新

Result: 两层softmax注意力模块能够以任意精度重现固定权重注意力头可实现的任何算法输出，单头注意力层也可实现但需要更长提示

Conclusion: 建立了上下文学习与算法模拟之间的直接联系，为大型Transformer作为提示可编程算法库提供了简单机制，确立了现代Transformer模型的算法通用性

Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer architecture with frozen weights is
capable of emulating a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. In
particular, for any algorithm implementable by a fixed-weight attention head
(e.g. one-step gradient descent or linear/ridge regression), there exists a
prompt that drives a two-layer softmax attention module to reproduce the
algorithm's output with arbitrary precision. This guarantee extends even to a
single-head attention layer (using longer prompts if necessary), achieving
architectural minimality. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an
algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product
gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This
construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All
adaptation happens through the prompt alone. These findings forge a direct link
between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple
mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of
algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms
via prompts alone, establishing a form of algorithmic universality in modern
Transformer models.

Motivation: ICU住院时间预测对医院资源管理至关重要，但由于电子健康记录的异质性和不规则采样特性，这一任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: S²G-Net架构包含两个路径：时间路径使用Mamba状态空间模型捕捉患者轨迹，图路径使用优化的GraphGPS骨干网络整合来自诊断、管理和语义特征的异质患者相似性图。

Conclusion: S²G-Net为多模态临床数据的ICU住院时间预测提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案，强调了原则性图构建的重要性。

Abstract: Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU)
is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging
due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health
records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural
architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba
state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path
leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous
patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic
features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that
S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba,
Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches
across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability
analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our
architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction.
These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable
solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

Motivation: 虽然LoRA和DoRA已被证明能大幅降低大型语言模型微调的计算成本，但这些方法在小型模型上的效果尚未得到充分验证。研究旨在探索这些高效微调技术在小规模语言模型上的适用性和性能表现。

Method: 使用minBERT作为案例研究，测试LoRA和DoRA的不同配置，结合自动混合精度(AMP)技术，通过多种架构、自定义损失函数和超参数优化，最终训练出一个优化的集成多任务minBERT模型。

Result: 研究发现即使在小模型空间中，梯度更新本质上也是低秩的，rank 1分解仅带来可忽略的性能损失。优化的LoRA和DoRA配置结合AMP能显著提升训练效率而不影响性能。

Conclusion: 低秩适应技术不仅适用于大型语言模型，在小规模模型上同样有效，这为资源有限的研究团队提供了高效微调小型语言模型的可行方案，同时验证了语言模型梯度更新的低秩特性具有普适性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial
intelligence, fine-tuning LLMs is extraordinarily computationally expensive,
preventing smaller businesses and research teams with limited GPU resources
from engaging with new research. Hu et al and Liu et al introduce Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) as highly
efficient and performant solutions to the computational challenges of LLM
fine-tuning, demonstrating huge speedups and memory usage savings for models
such as GPT-3 and RoBERTa. We seek to expand upon the original LoRA and DoRA
papers by benchmarking efficiency and performance of LoRA and DoRA when applied
to a much smaller scale of language model: our case study here is the compact
minBERT model. Our findings reveal that optimal custom configurations of LoRA
and DoRA, coupled with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), significantly enhance
training efficiency without compromising performance. Furthermore, while the
parameterization of minBERT is significantly smaller than GPT-3, our results
validate the observation that gradient updates to language models are
inherently low-rank even in small model space, observing that rank 1
decompositions yield negligible performance deficits. Furthermore, aided by our
highly efficient minBERT implementation, we investigate numerous architectures,
custom loss functions, and hyperparameters to ultimately train an optimal
ensembled multitask minBERT model to simultaneously perform sentiment analysis,
paraphrase detection, and similarity scoring.

prompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples. To
address this, we propose ReChartPrompt, which leverages real-world,
human-designed charts from arXiv papers as prompts instead of synthetic seeds.
Using the diverse styles and rich content of arXiv charts, we construct
ReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset. Another challenge
is that although SFT effectively improve code understanding, it often fails to
ensure that generated charts are visually consistent with the originals. To
address this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning
algorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of
attribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes such as
layout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual
similarity, which assesses similarity in texture and other overall visual
features using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based
rewards such as accuracy or format rewards, our reward considers the multimodal
nature of the chart-to-code task and effectively enhances the model's ability
to accurately reproduce charts. By integrating ReChartPrompt and ChartSimRL, we
develop the ChartMaster model, which achieves state-of-the-art results among
7B-parameter models and even rivals GPT-4o on various chart-to-code generation
benchmarks. All resources are available at

TL;DR: 提出PILF模型，通过PI控制机制整合当前和历史信息，加速SGD算法在高维稀疏矩阵中的收敛速度和泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SGD-LFA方法仅依赖当前样本的瞬时梯度信息，缺乏历史迭代经验和样本间内在关联，导致收敛慢和泛化性能不佳

Method: 开发PI加速SGD算法，整合相关实例并通过比例-积分控制机制精炼学习误差，利用当前和历史信息

Result: 对比实验证明PILF模型在高维稀疏矩阵上具有优越的表征能力

Conclusion: PILF模型通过PI控制机制有效解决了传统SGD-LFA方法的局限性，提升了收敛速度和泛化性能

Abstract: In industrial big data scenarios, high-dimensional sparse matrices (HDI) are
widely used to characterize high-order interaction relationships among massive
nodes. The stochastic gradient descent-based latent factor analysis (SGD-LFA)
method can effectively extract deep feature information embedded in HDI
matrices. However, existing SGD-LFA methods exhibit significant limitations:
their parameter update process relies solely on the instantaneous gradient
information of current samples, failing to incorporate accumulated experiential
knowledge from historical iterations or account for intrinsic correlations
between samples, resulting in slow convergence speed and suboptimal
generalization performance. Thus, this paper proposes a PILF model by
developing a PI-accelerated SGD algorithm by integrating correlated instances
and refining learning errors through proportional-integral (PI) control
mechanism that current and historical information; Comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior representation capability of the PILF model on HDI
matrices

Conclusion: QGAT展示了量子增强学习在化学、生物和网络分析等领域的可扩展潜力，其模块化设计便于集成到现有架构中增强经典注意力模型

Abstract: We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural
network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention
mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with
amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions.
Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each
head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate
multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter
sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model
complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are
optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to
learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing
complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive
scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning
across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore,
experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature
and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data.
The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing
architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation represents a significant advancement in boosting
the performance of machine learning (ML) models, particularly in fields where
data acquisition is challenging, such as echocardiography. The acquisition and
labeling of echocardiograms (echo) for heart assessment, crucial in
point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) settings, often encounter limitations due to
the restricted number of echo views available, typically captured by operators
with varying levels of experience. This study proposes a novel approach for
enhancing clinical diagnosis accuracy by synthetically generating echo views.
These views are conditioned on existing, real views of the heart, focusing
specifically on the estimation of ejection fraction (EF), a critical parameter
traditionally measured from biplane apical views. By integrating a conditional
generative model, we demonstrate an improvement in EF estimation accuracy,
providing a comparative analysis with traditional methods. Preliminary results
indicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not
only enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development
of more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models. This approach is
anticipated to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications, paving
the way for innovative solutions in medical imaging diagnostics.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains
challenging to predict due to its multifactorial etiology and the complexity of
multimodal clinical data. Accurate forecasting of clinically relevant
biomarkers, including diagnostic and quantitative measures, is essential for
effective monitoring of disease progression. This work introduces L2C-TabPFN, a
method that integrates a longitudinal-to-cross-sectional (L2C) transformation
with a pre-trained Tabular Foundation Model (TabPFN) to predict Alzheimer's
disease outcomes using the TADPOLE dataset. L2C-TabPFN converts sequential
patient records into fixed-length feature vectors, enabling robust prediction
of diagnosis, cognitive scores, and ventricular volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that, while L2C-TabPFN achieves competitive performance on
diagnostic and cognitive outcomes, it provides state-of-the-art results in
ventricular volume prediction. This key imaging biomarker reflects
neurodegeneration and progression in Alzheimer's disease. These findings
highlight the potential of tabular foundational models for advancing
longitudinal prediction of clinically relevant imaging markers in Alzheimer's
disease.

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持异质域共现数据的可视化探索，通过互信息最大化和条件概率着色实现了非对称关系的直观展示。

Abstract: This paper proposes an embedding method for co-occurrence data aimed at
visual information exploration. We consider cases where co-occurrence
probabilities are measured between pairs of elements from heterogeneous
domains. The proposed method maps these heterogeneous elements into
corresponding two-dimensional latent spaces, enabling visualization of
asymmetric relationships between the domains. The key idea is to embed the
elements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving
the original dependency structure as much as possible. This approach can be
naturally extended to cases involving three or more domains, using a
generalization of mutual information known as total correlation. For
inter-domain analysis, we also propose a visualization method that assigns
colors to the latent spaces based on conditional probabilities, allowing users
to explore asymmetric relationships interactively. We demonstrate the utility
of the method through applications to an adjective-noun dataset, the NeurIPS
dataset, and a subject-verb-object dataset, showcasing both intra- and
inter-domain analysis.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精炼提示方法引导的生成式多模态大语言模型能够可行地为现有认知测试生成稳健的合成规范数据，为开发新型图像认知评估奠定了基础，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for
evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based
on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available
normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming,
and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements
in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to
generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We
investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and
GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established
image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture
description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic
instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were
evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to
distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics
included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced
prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively
distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity
compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting
higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for
contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating
creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary
validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs,
guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic
normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for
developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional
limitations.

TL;DR: TiKMiX是一种动态调整语言模型预训练数据混合比例的方法，通过Group Influence指标评估数据域影响，相比静态混合策略显著提升性能并减少计算资源消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态数据混合策略在语言模型预训练中效果不佳，因为模型对不同数据域的学习偏好会随训练动态变化，但高效观测这些变化偏好存在挑战

Method: 提出Group Influence指标评估数据域影响，将数据混合问题转化为寻找最优影响最大化分布，开发TiKMiX-D直接优化方法和TiKMiX-M回归预测方法

Result: TiKMiX-D仅用20%计算资源就超越REGMIX等先进方法，TiKMiX-M在9个下游基准上平均性能提升2%，训练了最多1万亿tokens的不同规模模型

Conclusion: 模型的数据偏好随训练进度和规模动态变化，基于Group Influence动态调整数据混合能显著提升性能，缓解静态比例下的数据消化不足问题

Abstract: The data mixture used in the pre-training of a language model is a
cornerstone of its final performance. However, a static mixing strategy is
suboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift
dynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving
preferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant
challenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically
adjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX
introduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of
data domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data
mixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.
We solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and
TiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We
trained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion
tokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like
REGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to
an average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks. Our
experiments reveal that a model's data preferences evolve with training
progress and scale, and we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the data
mixture based on Group Influence, a direct measure of these preferences,
significantly improves performance by mitigating the underdigestion of data
seen with static ratios.

Result: 揭示了Mamba SSM在GPU上的运行特征，识别了性能瓶颈和优化机会

Conclusion: 研究为GPU微架构设计提供了重要见解，有助于继续扩展此类模型的性能

Abstract: Mamba-based State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as a promising alternative
to the ubiquitous transformers. Despite the expressive power of transformers,
the quadratic complexity of computing attention is a major impediment to
scaling performance as we increase the sequence length. SSMs provide an
alternative path that addresses this problem, reducing the computational
complexity requirements of self-attention with novel model architectures for
different domains and fields such as video, text generation and graphs. Thus,
it is important to characterize the behavior of these emerging workloads on
GPUs and understand their requirements during GPU microarchitectural design. In
this work we evaluate Mamba-based SSMs and characterize their behavior during
training on GPUs. We construct a workload suite that offers representative
models that span different model architectures. We then use this suite to
analyze the architectural implications of running Mamba-based SSMs on GPUs. Our
work sheds new light on potential optimizations to continue scaling the
performance for such models.

Result: 显著提高计算效率，改善模型精度，并将对抗鲁棒性泛化到未见过的攻击

Conclusion: 该方法在不同骨干架构和大规模对抗训练中均表现出有效性，为构建可信基础模型提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) with projected gradient descent is the most popular
method to improve model robustness under adversarial attacks. However,
computational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large
backbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This
paper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more
trustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based
approach for efficient AT directly in the feature space. We show that the
proposed adapter-based approach can improve the inner-loop convergence quality
by eliminating robust overfitting. As a result, it significantly increases
computational efficiency and improves model accuracy by generalizing
adversarial robustness to unseen attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the new adapter-based approach in different backbone architectures and in AT at
scale.

Motivation: 解决AI在科学中的作用讨论：大语言模型是否真正能够生成新知识，还是仅仅重新组合记忆的内容。需要一种可验证的方法来区分真正的创造性发现能力。

Method: 提出"unlearning-as-ablation"方法：系统性地移除目标结果和其完整的忘记闭包（包括引理、变体表达和多跳含义），然后评估模型是否能够仅从允许的公理和工具重新推导出该结果。

Result: 成功重新推导表明模型具有真正的生成能力，失败则曝露了当前的限制。该方法为评估AI科学发现能力提供了原则性框架。

Conclusion: 这种反向学习-分离测试可以作为下一代标准化测试框架，像ImageNet推动讦觉进步一样推动AI科学发现的发展，帮助区分仅会回忆的模型和能够创造性生成新科学知识的模型。

Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to
promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question:
do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely
remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable
test of constructive scientific discovery. The method systematically removes a
target result and its entire forget-closure (lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop
entailments) and then evaluates whether the model can re-derive the result from
only permitted axioms and tools. Success provides evidence for genuine
generative capability; failure exposes current limits. Unlike prevailing
motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing
repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We argue that such
tests could serve as the next generation of benchmarks, much as ImageNet
catalyzed progress in vision: distinguishing models that can merely recall from
those that can constructively generate new scientific knowledge. We outline a
minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms, and discuss extensions to physics,
chemistry, and biology. Whether models succeed or fail, unlearning-as-ablation
provides a principled framework to map the true reach and limits of AI
scientific discovery. This is a position paper: we advance a conceptual and
methodological argument rather than new empirical results.

Abstract: When do diffusion models reproduce their training data, and when are they
able to generate samples beyond it? A practically relevant theoretical
understanding of this interplay between memorization and generalization may
significantly impact real-world deployments of diffusion models with respect to
issues such as copyright infringement and data privacy. In this work, to
disentangle the different factors that influence memorization and
generalization in practical diffusion models, we introduce a scientific and
mathematical "laboratory" for investigating these phenomena in diffusion models
trained on fully synthetic or natural image-like structured data. Within this
setting, we hypothesize that the memorization or generalization behavior of an
underparameterized trained model is determined by the difference in training
loss between an associated memorizing model and a generalizing model. To probe
this hypothesis, we theoretically characterize a crossover point wherein the
weighted training loss of a fully generalizing model becomes greater than that
of an underparameterized memorizing model at a critical value of model
(under)parameterization. We then demonstrate via carefully-designed experiments
that the location of this crossover predicts a phase transition in diffusion
models trained via gradient descent, validating our hypothesis. Ultimately, our
theory enables us to analytically predict the model size at which memorization
becomes predominant. Our work provides an analytically tractable and
practically meaningful setting for future theoretical and empirical
investigations. Code for our experiments is available at

TL;DR: 本文分析了空中计算联邦学习在大规模客户端场景下的性能，发现增加客户端数量可以增强隐私保护、减轻信道衰落影响并改善收敛性能。

Motivation: 联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时进行协作模型训练，但通信资源有限制约了其性能，特别是在支持大量客户端的系统中。空中计算通过模拟信号传输中间参数来缓解通信瓶颈，但会带来信道失真问题。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架来分析大规模客户端场景下空中联邦学习的性能，并通过广泛的实验评估验证理论见解。

Result: 分析揭示了扩大参与客户端数量的三个关键优势：增强隐私保护（客户端本地梯度与服务器聚合梯度之间的互信息减少）、减轻信道衰落影响（信道硬化效应消除小尺度衰落）、改善收敛性能（降低热噪声和梯度估计误差）。

Conclusion: 空中模型训练是联邦学习在大型客户端网络中可行的解决方案，理论分析和实验验证都证实了其有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often
constrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems
supporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating
over-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising
solution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly
increases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by
transmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital
ones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced
distortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global
parameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical
framework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in
large-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of
scaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The
mutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's
aggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)
Mitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the
impact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved
Convergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the
convergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a
viable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of
clients. The theoretical insights are further substantiated through extensive
experimental evaluations.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is capable of accurate Load Forecasting from complete

Learning with Gaussian Copula to deal with sparsity, which contains three
modules: data complementation, ML construction, and adaptive ensemble. First,
it applies Gaussian Copula to eliminate sparsity. Then, we utilise five ML
models to make predictions individually. Finally, it employs adaptive ensemble
to get final weighted-sum result. Experiments have demonstrated that our model
are robust.

embedding watermarks, maintaining basic properties higher than 90.00\% while
achieving watermark accuracy greater than 95.00\%. Furthermore, downstream
docking simulations reveal comparable performance between original and
watermarked molecules, with binding affinities reaching -6.00 kcal/mol and root
mean square deviations below 1.602 \AA. These results confirm that our
watermarking technique effectively safeguards molecular intellectual property
without compromising scientific utility, enabling secure and responsible AI
integration in molecular discovery and research applications.

*Xuekang Wang,Shengyu Zhu,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding (SSD)方法，通过解码时集成小模型的安全属性来防御大语言模型的越狱攻击，同时加速推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已对LLMs进行对齐训练，但越狱攻击仍持续出现，需要在不重新训练大模型的情况下增强其安全属性

Method: 利用具备安全属性的小模型，在解码时进行推测采样，通过匹配比率量化越狱风险，动态切换解码策略，结合大小模型的分布采样输出

Result: SSD成功为大模型赋予所需安全属性，保持对良性查询的有用性，同时加速推理时间

Conclusion: SSD提供了一种轻量级的解码时安全增强方案，有效防御越狱攻击并提升推理效率

Abstract: Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities
continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with
additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning
large models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty
ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding
(SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired
safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a
small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates
speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the
small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to
dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to
handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then
sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original
and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips
the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to
remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference
time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 文本嵌入空间可以裁剪至50%而下游任务性能仍保持良好，这是因为过多的均匀分布维度反而对性能有负面影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本嵌入空间裁剪对下游任务的惊人影响，以获得更小嵌入空间的优势和对文本编码的深入见解

Method: 在6个状态之艾的文本编码器和26个下游任务中进行实验，随机移除嵌入维度并测试性能变化

Result: 随机移除至50%嵌入维度仅导致检索和分类任务性能下降不过10%，还发现过多的均匀分布维度移除后反而提升性能

Conclusion: 文本嵌入空间存在显著的冗余，这种现象不仅仅限于分类和检索任务，在生成式任务中也存在

Abstract: In this paper, we study the surprising impact that truncating text embeddings
has on downstream performance. We consistently observe across 6
state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing
up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance,
less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of
using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text
encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested
in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation
space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions
actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why,
on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a
marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the
embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on
generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to
classification or retrieval tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MANGO是一个新颖的分层强化学习框架，通过多层抽象和嵌套选项来解决长期稀疏奖励环境的挑战，显著提高了样本效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在长期稀疏奖励环境中面临样本效率低和泛化能力差的问题，需要一种能够分解复杂任务并重用学习动作的框架。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为多层抽象空间，每层定义抽象状态并使用选项将轨迹模块化为宏动作，通过层内策略和任务动作实现跨层嵌套和任务集成。

Result: 在程序生成的网格环境中实验表明，相比标准RL方法，MANGO在样本效率和泛化能力方面有显著提升，同时增强了决策过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: MANGO为稀疏奖励环境提供了有效的分层解决方案，未来将探索自动抽象发现、连续环境适应和更鲁棒的多层训练策略。

Abstract: This paper introduces MANGO (Multilayer Abstraction for Nested Generation of
Options), a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed to
address the challenges of long-term sparse reward environments. MANGO
decomposes complex tasks into multiple layers of abstraction, where each layer
defines an abstract state space and employs options to modularize trajectories
into macro-actions. These options are nested across layers, allowing for
efficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency. The
framework introduces intra-layer policies that guide the agent's transitions
within the abstract state space, and task actions that integrate task-specific
components such as reward functions. Experiments conducted in
procedurally-generated grid environments demonstrate substantial improvements
in both sample efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to standard
RL methods. MANGO also enhances interpretability by making the agent's
decision-making process transparent across layers, which is particularly
valuable in safety-critical and industrial applications. Future work will
explore automated discovery of abstractions and abstract actions, adaptation to
continuous or fuzzy environments, and more robust multi-layer training
strategies.

*Jelke Wibbeke,Nico Schönfisch,Sebastian Rohjans,Andreas Rauh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了回归校准指标的不一致性问题，发现不同指标对同一校准结果的评估经常产生冲突甚至矛盾，并推荐了ENCE和CWC作为最可靠的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，数据驱动模型不仅需要准确，还必须提供可靠的uncertainty估计。虽然回归领域已有多种校准指标和重校准方法，但这些指标在定义、假设和尺度上差异很大，难以跨研究比较结果，且大多数重校准方法仅使用少量指标评估，无法确定改进是否适用于不同校准概念。

Method: 从文献中系统提取和分类回归校准指标，独立于特定建模方法或重校准方法对这些指标进行基准测试。通过使用真实世界数据、合成数据和人工失准数据的受控实验来评估指标性能。

Result: 实验表明校准指标经常产生冲突结果：许多指标对同一重校准结果的评估存在分歧，有些甚至得出矛盾结论。ENCE（期望归一化校准误差）和CWC（覆盖宽度准则）在测试中表现最为可靠。

Conclusion: 校准研究中指标选择具有关键作用，当前指标不一致的问题可能导致通过挑选指标来制造误导性的成功印象，需要谨慎选择可靠的校准评估指标。

Abstract: In safety-critical applications data-driven models must not only be accurate
but also provide reliable uncertainty estimates. This property, commonly
referred to as calibration, is essential for risk-aware decision-making. In
regression a wide variety of calibration metrics and recalibration methods have
emerged. However, these metrics differ significantly in their definitions,
assumptions and scales, making it difficult to interpret and compare results
across studies. Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using
only a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements
generalize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we
systematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the
literature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling
methods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with
real-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that
calibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results. Our analysis
reveals substantial inconsistencies: many metrics disagree in their evaluation
of the same recalibration result, and some even indicate contradictory
conclusions. This inconsistency is particularly concerning as it potentially
allows cherry-picking of metrics to create misleading impressions of success.
We identify the Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and the Coverage
Width-based Criterion (CWC) as the most dependable metrics in our tests. Our
findings highlight the critical role of metric selection in calibration
research.

TL;DR: 提出基于遗传算法的深度学习网络调度方法Puzzle，通过子图划分在多模型场景下实现异构处理器高效调度，相比基准方法提升2.2-3.7倍请求频率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备硬件异构性增强，现有调度方法局限于单模型场景，忽视硬件/软件配置差异，执行时间估计不准确

Method: 使用遗传算法将网络划分为多个子图，采用三种染色体类型进行划分/映射/优先级探索，结合设备在环分析实现精确执行时间估计

Result: 在9个先进网络的随机场景测试中，Puzzle相比NPU Only和Best Mapping基准方法分别支持3.7倍和2.2倍的平均请求频率提升

Conclusion: 提出的遗传算法调度方法能有效处理多模型场景下的异构处理器调度问题，满足实时性要求的同时显著提升系统性能

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed on mobile devices, modern
mobile devices incorporate deep learning-specific accelerators to handle the
growing computational demands, thus increasing their hardware heterogeneity.
However, existing works on scheduling deep learning workloads across these
processors have significant limitations: most studies focus on single-model
scenarios rather than realistic multi-model scenarios, overlook performance
variations from different hardware/software configurations, and struggle with
accurate execution time estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning
networks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple
subgraphs. Our approach incorporates three different types of chromosomes for
partition/mapping/priority exploration, and leverages device-in-the-loop
profiling and evaluation for accurate execution time estimation. Based on this
methodology, our system, Puzzle, demonstrates superior performance in extensive
evaluations with randomly generated scenarios involving nine state-of-the-art
networks. The results demonstrate Puzzle can support 3.7 and 2.2 times higher
request frequency on average compared to the two heuristic baselines, NPU Only
and Best Mapping, respectively, while satisfying the equivalent level of
real-time requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型的监督微调(SFT)往往导致泛化能力下降，原有能力在新任务或领域上会退化

Method: 受强化学习中TRPO和PPO的启发，将SFT视为具有恒定正优势的策略梯度方法特例，提出PSFT目标函数来约束策略漂移

Result: 在数学和人类价值观领域的实验表明，PSFT在域内性能与SFT相当，在域外泛化上优于SFT，训练稳定性更好，且为后续优化提供更强基础

Conclusion: PSFT通过信任区域约束有效解决了SFT的泛化问题，同时保持训练稳定性，为后续训练阶段留出优化空间

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of foundation models often leads to poor
generalization, where prior capabilities deteriorate after tuning on new tasks
or domains. Inspired by trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal
policy optimization (PPO) in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose Proximal
SFT (PSFT). This fine-tuning objective incorporates the benefits of
trust-region, effectively constraining policy drift during SFT while
maintaining competitive tuning. By viewing SFT as a special case of policy
gradient methods with constant positive advantages, we derive PSFT that
stabilizes optimization and leads to generalization, while leaving room for
further optimization in subsequent post-training stages. Experiments across
mathematical and human-value domains show that PSFT matches SFT in-domain,
outperforms it in out-of-domain generalization, remains stable under prolonged
training without causing entropy collapse, and provides a stronger foundation
for the subsequent optimization.

applicable to both flow matching and Markov bridge frameworks. Furthermore, we
extend our model to also explore the conformational landscape of the protein by
jointly sampling side chain angles and molecules.

TL;DR: 本文研究了注意力机制中归一化的局限性，通过理论分析和实验验证发现随着选择token数量增加，模型区分信息性token的能力下降，且softmax归一化在低温度设置下存在梯度敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力机制中归一化处理的局限性，特别是softmax缩放对token选择和几何分离能力的影响，为改进注意力架构提供理论基础。

Method: 建立理论分析框架评估模型选择能力和几何分离特性，通过预训练GPT-2模型进行实验验证，分析距离边界和分离标准。

Result: 随着选择token数量增加，模型区分信息性token的能力显著下降，趋向均匀选择模式；softmax归一化在低温度设置下存在梯度敏感性问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对基于softmax的注意力机制的理解，表明需要开发更鲁棒的归一化和选择策略来改进未来注意力架构。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的统计框架，通过分析MPNN表示的信噪比(SNR)来揭示异质性(homophily)和结构瓶颈之间的关系，并开发了BRIDGE图重连算法来优化图结构，在各种同质性机制下实现近乎完美的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消息传递神经网络(MPNNs)在节点分类任务中表现强大，但在异质性(低同类连接性)和结构瓶颈情况下性能受限。需要建立一个理论框架来理解这些限制的根本原因，并提供有效的解决方案。

Method: 1) 建立统计框架分析MPNN表示的信噪比(SNR)；2) 证明对类间信号的敏感度受高阶同质性限制；3) 通过图集合分析将瓶颈分解为深度不足和过度压缩；4) 开发BRIDGE图重连算法，基于最优图结构理论(不相交的单类和双类二分簇)。

Result: BRIDGE算法在合成基准测试中所有同质性机制下都实现了近乎完美的分类准确率，在真实世界基准测试中显著改进性能，特别是在MPNN通常表现不佳的"中等同质性陷阱"区域超越了现有标准重连技术。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供了评估MPNN性能的诊断工具，还通过原则性的图修改方法提供了简单而有效的性能增强手段。理论分析揭示了高阶同质性与结构瓶颈之间的深层关系，为图神经网络优化提供了新的理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node
classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low
same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a
unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily
and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN
representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent
parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity
to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation
of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low
higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural
bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph
ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking
into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and
oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with
closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising
higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and
two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based
rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across
all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on
real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs
typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the
literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use,
provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet
effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph
modification.

Motivation: 随着单中心计算面临功耗限制，去中心化训练变得至关重要。强化学习后训练可以增强大语言模型，但在异构分布式环境中由于紧密耦合的采样-学习交替而面临挑战。

Method: 提出HeteroRL异步RL架构，将rollout采样与参数学习解耦；提出GEPO（Group Expectation Policy Optimization）方法，通过改进的采样机制降低重要性权重方差。

Result: 理论证明GEPO实现指数级方差减少；实验显示在1800秒延迟下性能下降小于3%，比GRPO等方法具有更好的稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在异构网络中展示了去中心化RL的强大潜力，能够有效应对网络延迟带来的挑战。

Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized
training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training
enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous
distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning
alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that
decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment
across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that
latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high
variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization
(GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling
mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction.
Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with
less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating
strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

Conclusion: Ada-TransGNN模型通过整合全局空间语义和时间行为，有效提高了空气质量预测的准确性，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate air quality prediction is becoming increasingly important in the
environmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow
real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results,
we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method
(Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior.
The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set
comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network
to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex
air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between
different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning
module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven
manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing
the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an
auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of
temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the
optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of
prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark
dataset and a novel dataset (Mete-air). The results demonstrate that our model
outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models in short-term and
long-term predictions.

Result: 在真实世界频谱数据上的实验表明，SFFP框架在频谱预测方面优于领先的频谱预测方法和通用预测方法。

Conclusion: SFFP框架通过分数域变换和自适应滤波有效解决了频谱数据中模式与噪声分离的难题，为动态频谱接入和资源分配提供了更准确的预测解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate spectrum prediction is crucial for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and
resource allocation. However, due to the unique characteristics of spectrum
data, existing methods based on the time or frequency domain often struggle to
separate predictable patterns from noise. To address this, we propose the
Spectral Fractional Filtering and Prediction (SFFP) framework. SFFP first
employs an adaptive fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) module to transform
spectrum data into a suitable fractional Fourier domain, enhancing the
separability of predictable trends from noise. Subsequently, an adaptive Filter
module selectively suppresses noise while preserving critical predictive
features within this domain. Finally, a prediction module, leveraging a
complex-valued neural network, learns and forecasts these filtered trend
components. Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that the SFFP
outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.

Result: Stiefel优化器在LoRA和DoRA基准测试中持续优于AdamW，证明几何约束是释放LoRA全部潜力的关键

Conclusion: 几何优化方法是实现高效LLM微调的有效途径，正交约束显著提升了参数效率和表示能力

Abstract: While powerful, large language models (LLMs) present significant fine-tuning
challenges due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods
like LoRA provide solutions, yet suffer from critical optimizer inefficiencies;
notably basis redundancy in LoRA's $B$ matrix when using AdamW, which
fundamentally limits performance. We address this by optimizing the $B$ matrix
on the Stiefel manifold, imposing explicit orthogonality constraints that
achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank. This geometric
approach dramatically enhances parameter efficiency and representational
capacity. Our Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across
benchmarks with both LoRA and DoRA, demonstrating that geometric constraints
are the key to unlocking LoRA's full potential for effective LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in
datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important
goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated
data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower
overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often
focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of
dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise
annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this
work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting
label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label
errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label
errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all
mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on
a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection
performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art
approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple
tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization
study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label
errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real
label error detection in Cityscapes.

Abstract: Cross-client data heterogeneity in federated learning induces biases that
impede unbiased consensus condensation and the complementary fusion of
generalization- and personalization-oriented knowledge. While existing
approaches mitigate heterogeneity through model decoupling and representation
center loss, they often rely on static and restricted metrics to evaluate local
knowledge and adopt global alignment too rigidly, leading to consensus
distortion and diminished model adaptability. To address these limitations, we
propose FedMate, a method that implements bilateral optimization: On the server
side, we construct a dynamic global prototype, with aggregation weights
calibrated by holistic integration of sample size, current parameters, and
future prediction; a category-wise classifier is then fine-tuned using this
prototype to preserve global consistency. On the client side, we introduce
complementary classification fusion to enable merit-based discrimination
training and incorporate cost-aware feature transmission to balance model
performance and communication efficiency. Experiments on five datasets of
varying complexity demonstrate that FedMate outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in harmonizing generalization and adaptation. Additionally, semantic
segmentation experiments on autonomous driving datasets validate the method's
real-world scalability.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G)
networks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the
underlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital
systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against
transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature
imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial
error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature
distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a
property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the
subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a
generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to
efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we
develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error
protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic
importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint
Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions,
achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS) scores.

Abstract: In this PhD thesis, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty
quantification in machine learning, which is based on proper scores.
Uncertainty quantification is an important cornerstone for trustworthy and
reliable machine learning applications in practice. Usually, approaches to
uncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights
cannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss
functions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very
general definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even
generative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that
connect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration
with proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We
achieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly
proper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the
kernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based
generative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language
generation. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large
language models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we
generalize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which
motivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a
novel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel
risk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration
errors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another
kernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable
evaluation of generative image models.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown substantial success in various
applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This study aims to
identify and isolate the components of two different adversarial training
techniques that contribute most to increased adversarial robustness,
particularly through the lens of margins in the input space -- the minimal
distance between data points and decision boundaries. Specifically, we compare
two methods that maximize margins: a simple approach which modifies the loss
function to increase an approximation of the margin, and a more complex
state-of-the-art method (Dynamics-Aware Robust Training) which builds upon this
approach. Using a VGG-16 model as our base, we systematically isolate and
evaluate individual components from these methods to determine their relative
impact on adversarial robustness. We assess the effect of each component on the
model's performance under various adversarial attacks, including AutoAttack and
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Our analysis on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveals
which elements most effectively enhance adversarial robustness, providing
insights for designing more robust DNNs.

Abstract: Leveraging information from public data has become increasingly crucial in
enhancing the utility of differentially private (DP) methods. Traditional DP
approaches often require adding noise based solely on private data, which can
significantly degrade utility. In this paper, we address this limitation in the
context of the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE) of linear regression
based on sufficient statistics perturbation (SSP) under the unbounded data
assumption. We propose a novel method that involves transforming private data
using the public second-moment matrix to compute a transformed SSP-OLSE, whose
second-moment matrix yields a better condition number and improves the OLSE
accuracy and robustness. We derive theoretical error bounds about our method
and the standard SSP-OLSE to the non-DP OLSE, which reveal the improved
robustness and accuracy achieved by our approach. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series data is a
long-standing challenge in signal processing. Recent advancements in statistics
and machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing
on Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt
changes in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming
fashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when
computing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to
leverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this
issue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical
Karcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function
(robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic
whose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We
propose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust
centroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world
data across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance
of our proposed method.

Abstract: Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven
by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and
efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures
have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop
aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce
significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In
response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture
that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach
incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and
Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational
efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size,
adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations
using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train
over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The
introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with
up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves
parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller.
The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on
average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while
having a similar training speed. Code and datasets are available at

Method: 引入连续时间动态1-WL测试，证明其与连续时间动态展开树的等价性，基于离散动态GNN架构设计连续时间动态GNN（CGNN），使用分段连续可微时间函数处理异步不连通图。

Conclusion: 成功将GNN理论扩展到连续时间动态图领域，为处理现实世界中异步演化的图数据提供了理论基础和实用架构设计指南。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to match the distinguishing power of
the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, and the resulting partitions coincide with
the unfolding tree equivalence classes of graphs. Preserving this equivalence,
GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability
up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots.
Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction
networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into
disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with
arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic
1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees,
and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on
discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and
universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield
practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN
architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to
process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy by keeping local datasets on-device. In
this work, we address FL settings where clients may behave adversarially,
exhibiting Byzantine attacks, while the central server is trusted and equipped
with a reference dataset. We propose FedGreed, a resilient aggregation strategy
for federated learning that does not require any assumptions about the fraction
of adversarial participants. FedGreed orders clients' local model updates based
on their loss metrics evaluated against a trusted dataset on the server and
greedily selects a subset of clients whose models exhibit the minimal
evaluation loss. Unlike many existing approaches, our method is designed to
operate reliably under heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions, which are
prevalent in real-world deployments. FedGreed exhibits convergence guarantees
and bounded optimality gaps under strong adversarial behavior. Experimental
evaluations on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms standard and robust federated learning baselines,
such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum, in the majority of
adversarial scenarios considered, including label flipping and Gaussian noise
injection attacks. All experiments were conducted using the Flower federated
learning framework.

Result: 在简单、中等和复杂三类未见攻击场景下，HQC-AE都显著超过传统监督学习模型、现有无监督方法和经典自动编码器。平均检测准确率97.71%，偏差率0.62%。复杂攻击下检测准确率98.23%，偏差率1.85%。

Conclusion: 混合量子-经典自动编码器方法能够高效地主动检测各种静态GNSS接收机平台上的零日时间推送偷窃攻击，解决了依赖偷窃数据训练的限制。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical for Positioning,
Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. However, GNSS are highly vulnerable
to spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead
receivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected
navigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most
existing spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques
and struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this
limitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid
Quantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS
signals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted
during the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT
solutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS
receivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,
where attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time
computations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen
time-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and
sophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently
outperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based
models, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,
unseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy
of 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs
but is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an
accuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day
GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver
platforms.

Abstract: We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination
of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference
methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world
applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise
with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in
flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on
conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To
enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use
simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step
of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates
converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite
observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining
EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.

Abstract: Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their
quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting
both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that
interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable
Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear
memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory
through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers
wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On
seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches
or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST;
with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir
principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient
long-term time-series prediction.

Abstract: The ``black-box'' nature of deep learning models presents a significant
barrier to their adoption for scientific discovery, where interpretability is
paramount. This challenge is especially pronounced in discovering the governing
equations of dynamical processes on networks or graphs, since even their
topological structure further affects the processes' behavior. This paper
provides a rigorous, comparative assessment of state-of-the-art symbolic
regression techniques for this task. We evaluate established methods, including
sparse regression and MLP-based architectures, and introduce a novel adaptation
of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs, designed to exploit their
inherent interpretability. Across a suite of synthetic and real-world dynamical
systems, our results demonstrate that both MLP and KAN-based architectures can
successfully identify the underlying symbolic equations, significantly
surpassing existing baselines. Critically, we show that KANs achieve this
performance with greater parsimony and transparency, as their learnable
activation functions provide a clearer mapping to the true physical dynamics.
This study offers a practical guide for researchers, clarifying the trade-offs
between model expressivity and interpretability, and establishes the viability
of neural-based architectures for robust scientific discovery on complex

TL;DR: Prose是一个2.8亿参数的可转移归一化流模型，能够零样本生成任意肽系统的无相关样本，实现了跨序列长度的可转移性，在四肽采样中性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分子动力学和马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法缺乏摊销性，每个系统都需要重新计算采样成本。现有学习采样器在跨系统转移方面能力有限。

Method: 开发了Prose——一个基于深度学习的可转移归一化流模型，使用包含最多8个残基的肽分子动力学轨迹数据进行训练。

Result: Prose能够零样本生成任意肽系统的无相关提案样本，实现了跨序列长度的可转移性，在四肽采样中性能优于顺序蒙特卡洛等传统方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习能够设计可扩展和可转移的采样器，Prose证明了归一化流在分子构象采样中的有效性，为摊销采样方法研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core
challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical
approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently
lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for
each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has
inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling
algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on
a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to
transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of
scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million
parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide
molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws
zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems,
achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length,
whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows.
Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as
a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance
sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to
established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides. We
open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further
stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出三阶段分布式训练方法（MIT+自适应批处理DiLoCo+切换模式），通过并行多实例训练、动态调整批次大小和梯度累积切换，显著提升异构硬件利用率和训练效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练方法如DiLoCo无法充分利用动态工作负载下的计算集群资源，存在硬件利用率低和同步延迟高的问题

Method: 三阶段方法：1）多实例训练(MIT)并行运行多个轻量级训练流；2）自适应批处理DiLoCo动态调整本地批次大小平衡计算通信；3）切换模式在批次过大时无缝引入梯度累积

Result: 提高了吞吐量、减少了空闲时间、显著降低了同步延迟、提升了收敛速度和系统效率，并提供了理论通信次数估计

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了异构硬件资源利用不足的问题，在动态工作负载下实现了更高效的LLM分布式训练

Abstract: Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not
only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous
hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated
promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters
under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage
method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo,
and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple
lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and
merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time.
Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance
computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays.
Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient
accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits.
Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system
efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of
communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our
method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于双曲几何的HypER回声状态网络，通过双曲距离的指数衰减连接来匹配混沌系统的拉伸-折叠结构，显著延长了混沌系统的有效预测时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的回声状态网络(ESN)使用欧几里得几何的储备池，与混沌系统的拉伸-折叠结构不匹配，导致预测时间受限

Method: 在庞加莱球中采样神经元，连接权重随双曲距离指数衰减，保持ESN的稀疏性、泄漏积分和谱半径控制等特性，仅训练Tikhonov正则化的读出层

Result: 在Lorenz-63、Roessler系统和Chen-Ueta超混沌吸引子上，HypER显著延长了平均有效预测时间，在30次独立运行中均优于欧几里得和图结构ESN基线，在心率变异性和太阳黑子数等真实数据上也表现出优势

Conclusion: 双曲几何嵌入能够更好地匹配混沌动力学，为混沌系统预测提供了新的有效方法

Abstract: Forecasting chaotic dynamics beyond a few Lyapunov times is difficult because
infinitesimal errors grow exponentially. Existing Echo State Networks (ESNs)
mitigate this growth but employ reservoirs whose Euclidean geometry is
mismatched to the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos. We introduce the
Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER), an ESN whose neurons are sampled in the
Poincare ball and whose connections decay exponentially with hyperbolic
distance. This negative-curvature construction embeds an exponential metric
directly into the latent space, aligning the reservoir's local
expansion-contraction spectrum with the system's Lyapunov directions while
preserving standard ESN features such as sparsity, leaky integration, and
spectral-radius control. Training is limited to a Tikhonov-regularized readout.
On the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Roessler systems, and the hyperchaotic Chen-Ueta
attractor, HypER consistently lengthens the mean valid-prediction horizon
beyond Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines, with statistically
significant gains confirmed over 30 independent runs; parallel results on
real-world benchmarks, including heart-rate variability from the Santa Fe and
MIT-BIH datasets and international sunspot numbers, corroborate its advantage.
We further establish a lower bound on the rate of state divergence for HypER,
mirroring Lyapunov growth.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合深度学习和矩阵补全的方法，用于恢复物联网网络定位中受异常值污染的欧几里得距离矩阵，通过神经网络和稀疏正则化有效处理异常值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定位技术在矩阵全集上搜索解，而本方法将搜索限制在欧几里得距离矩阵集合内，旨在更准确地恢复传感器位置信息，特别是在存在异常值的情况下。

Method: 将距离矩阵D表示为传感器坐标矩阵X的函数，利用深度神经网络联合恢复D和X；将异常值建模为稀疏矩阵L，并通过添加正则化项到优化问题中，交替更新X、D和L来求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，即使在存在异常值的情况下，所提出的技术也能准确恢复传感器的位置信息。

Conclusion: 该方法通过限制搜索空间和结合深度学习与稀疏正则化，有效提高了在异常值污染下的欧几里得距离矩阵恢复和传感器定位的准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning and matrix completion aided
approach for recovering an outlier contaminated Euclidean distance matrix D in
IoT network localization. Unlike conventional localization techniques that
search the solution over a whole set of matrices, the proposed technique
restricts the search to the set of Euclidean distance matrices. Specifically,
we express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently
satisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a
deep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse
matrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We
then solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location
information of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TACs框架通过将工作流重新定义为类型化概率程序，使用梯度优化方法解决LLM组合工作流的脆弱性问题，在结构化任务上显著优于现有提示优化方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM组合工作流主要依赖离散提示优化，这种方法脆弱且难以保证结构化任务的正式合规性，需要更可靠的理论基础和方法

Method: 提出Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs)框架，将整个工作流（包含参数高效适配的LLM和确定性逻辑）视为未归一化的联合分布，支持基于梯度的原则性训练，即使存在潜在中间结构

Result: TACs在结构化任务上显著优于最先进的提示优化基线：27B模型在MGSM-SymPy上从57.1%提升到75.9%，7B模型在MGSM上从1.6%提升到27.3%

Conclusion: TACs为开发可靠、任务合规的LLM系统提供了一个强大且理论基础扎实的新范式

Abstract: Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step
workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing
discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce
the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce
Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow
adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire
workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and
deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables
principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures.
We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective,
proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type
compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured
tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM
from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically
grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的预测评估指标往往与真实世界下游任务的影响度量存在差异，现有的方法要么依赖多个任务特定指标，要么需要先验已知的成本结构，这在实际应用中存在局限性。

Method: 基于适当评分规则理论，探索确保适当性保持的评分规则变换，使用神经网络参数化的加权评分规则，通过学习权重来与下游任务性能对齐。

Result: 通过合成和真实数据的回归任务实验展示了该框架的潜力，能够弥合预测评估与下游效用之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现快速可扩展的评估循环，适用于权重复杂或先验未知的任务，为模块化预测系统提供了更好的评估对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Every prediction is ultimately used in a downstream task. Consequently,
evaluating prediction quality is more meaningful when considered in the context
of its downstream use. Metrics based solely on predictive performance often
diverge from measures of real-world downstream impact. Existing approaches
incorporate the downstream view by relying on multiple task-specific metrics,
which can be burdensome to analyze, or by formulating cost-sensitive
evaluations that require an explicit cost structure, typically assumed to be
known a priori. We frame this mismatch as an evaluation alignment problem and
propose a data-driven method to learn a proxy evaluation function aligned with
the downstream evaluation. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, we
explore transformations of scoring rules that ensure the preservation of
propriety. Our approach leverages weighted scoring rules parametrized by a
neural network, where weighting is learned to align with the performance in the
downstream task. This enables fast and scalable evaluation cycles across tasks
where the weighting is complex or unknown a priori. We showcase our framework
through synthetic and real-data experiments for regression tasks, demonstrating
its potential to bridge the gap between predictive evaluation and downstream
utility in modular prediction systems.

TL;DR: Ano是一种新型优化器，通过解耦方向和平滑来提升在非平稳和噪声环境中的鲁棒性，同时保持一阶方法的简单性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的优化器如Adam和Adan在非平稳或噪声环境中性能会下降，主要因为它们依赖基于动量的幅度估计。

Method: Ano优化器将方向和平滑解耦：使用动量进行方向平滑，而瞬时梯度幅度决定步长。还提出了Anolog，通过对数调度扩展动量窗口来消除对动量系数的敏感性。

Result: 理论分析建立了非凸收敛保证，收敛速率与其他基于符号的方法相似。实证显示Ano在噪声和非平稳环境（如强化学习）中表现优异，在低噪声任务（如计算机视觉基准）中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Ano通过创新的方向-幅度解耦设计，提供了在挑战性优化环境中的显著性能提升，同时保持了方法的简洁性和理论保证。

Abstract: Stochastic optimizers are central to deep learning, yet widely used methods
such as Adam and Adan can degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments,
partly due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates. We
introduce Ano, a novel optimizer that decouples direction and magnitude:
momentum is used for directional smoothing, while instantaneous gradient
magnitudes determine step size. This design improves robustness to gradient
noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We
further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient
by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish
non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other
sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in
noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while
remaining competitive on low-noise tasks such as standard computer vision
benchmarks.

Abstract: Biomechanical forward simulation holds great potential for HCI, enabling the
generation of human-like movements in interactive tasks. However, training
biomechanical models with reinforcement learning is challenging, particularly
for precise and dexterous movements like those required for touchscreen
interactions on mobile devices. Current approaches are limited in their
interaction fidelity, require restricting the underlying biomechanical model to
reduce complexity, and do not generalize well. In this work, we propose
practical improvements to training routines that reduce training time, increase
interaction fidelity beyond existing methods, and enable the use of more
complex biomechanical models. Using a touchscreen pointing task, we demonstrate
that curriculum learning, action masking, more complex network configurations,
and simple adjustments to the simulation environment can significantly improve
the agent's ability to learn accurate touch behavior. Our work provides HCI
researchers with practical tips and training routines for developing better
biomechanical models of human-like interaction fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在VR中准确预测用户意图对于创造沉浸式体验至关重要，特别是在需要精确触觉反馈的复杂抓取任务中。需要评估不同方法处理用户行为多变性的能力。

Method: 利用手部运动时间序列数据，在810次试验中评估分类和回归方法，测试不同物体类型、尺寸和操作方式。重点分析LSTM网络等回归方法。

Result: 分类模型在用户间泛化能力差，性能不稳定。回归模型(特别是LSTM)表现更稳健，在抓取前2秒关键窗口内时间误差在0.25秒内，距离误差约5-20cm。

Conclusion: 回归方法比分类方法更适合处理VR中用户行为的动态复杂性，为实时预测用户动作和自适应触觉反馈奠定了基础，但精确手部姿态预测仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating
immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions
where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage
time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and
regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and
manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to
generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast,
regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within
0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second
window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand
postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user
variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and
how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user
behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models
to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and
lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user
actions in VR.

Motivation: 随着AI模型生成逐步推理文本的普及，这些文本被视为理解模型计算过程的窗口。但需要验证人类对这些推理文本的理解是否与模型的实际计算过程相符

Method: 通过基于反事实测量构建问题，评估人类识别推理文本中步骤间因果影响的能力，并分析参与者的准确率和一致性

Result: 参与者准确率仅为29.3%，略高于随机水平(25%)，即使在高度一致的问题上，多数投票的准确率也只有42%，显示显著的人类-模型理解差距

Conclusion: 推理文本不应被简单视为可解释性工具，而应作为需要深入研究的对象。理解模型使用语言的非人类方式是关键研究方向，挑战了当前对AI推理文本透明性的假设

Abstract: A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before
producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into
their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and
interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this
text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we
investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to
identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We
evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual
measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only
29.3%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating
the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a
fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use
it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that
reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken
at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use
language is a critical research direction.

Conclusion: 语言基础的推理和体验在用户为中心的AR导航系统设计中具有重要意义和潜力

Abstract: Delivering intelligent and adaptive navigation assistance in augmented
reality (AR) requires more than visual cues, as it demands systems capable of
interpreting flexible user intent and reasoning over both spatial and semantic
context. Prior AR navigation systems often rely on rigid input schemes or
predefined commands, which limit the utility of rich building data and hinder
natural interaction. In this work, we propose an embodied AR navigation system
that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with a multi-agent
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to support flexible,
language-driven goal retrieval and route planning. The system orchestrates
three language agents, Triage, Search, and Response, built on large language
models (LLMs), which enables robust interpretation of open-ended queries and
spatial reasoning using BIM data. Navigation guidance is delivered through an
embodied AR agent, equipped with voice interaction and locomotion, to enhance
user experience. A real-world user study yields a System Usability Scale (SUS)
score of 80.5, indicating excellent usability, and comparative evaluations show
that the embodied interface can significantly improves users' perception of
system intelligence. These results underscore the importance and potential of
language-grounded reasoning and embodiment in the design of user-centered AR
navigation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为行动和语言障碍人士提供低成本、易获取的视线追踪通信解决方案，解决传统外观基接口的精度问题和复杂命令集操作困难

Method: 开发多模态外观基视线控制虚拟键盘，结合深度学习与标准摄像头硬件，支持同步和异步两种命令选择模式，包含9个命令菜单和56个英文字符输入功能

Result: 在20名健全参与者测试中，网络摄像头同步模式达到10.94±1.89字母/分钟输入速度，信息传输率在命令级为80.29±15.72比特/分钟，具有良好的可用性和低工作负荷

Conclusion: 该系统展示了作为低资源环境下可访问通信工具的潜力，用户中心设计使其成为传统眼动仪的可行替代方案

Abstract: Over the past decade, the demand for communication devices has increased
among individuals with mobility and speech impairments. Eye-gaze tracking has
emerged as a promising solution for hands-free communication; however,
traditional appearance-based interfaces often face challenges such as accuracy
issues, involuntary eye movements, and difficulties with extensive command
sets. This work presents a multimodal appearance-based gaze-controlled virtual
keyboard that utilises deep learning in conjunction with standard camera
hardware, incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous modes for command
selection. The virtual keyboard application supports menu-based selection with
nine commands, enabling users to spell and type up to 56 English characters,
including uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation, and a delete function
for corrections. The proposed system was evaluated with twenty able-bodied
participants who completed specially designed typing tasks using three input
modalities: (i) a mouse, (ii) an eye-tracker, and (iii) an unmodified webcam.
Typing performance was measured in terms of speed and information transfer rate
(ITR) at both command and letter levels. Average typing speeds were 18.3+-5.31
letters/min (mouse), 12.60+-2.99letters/min (eye-tracker, synchronous), 10.94
+- 1.89 letters/min (webcam, synchronous), 11.15 +- 2.90 letters/min
(eye-tracker, asynchronous), and 7.86 +- 1.69 letters/min (webcam,
asynchronous). ITRs were approximately 80.29 +- 15.72 bits/min (command level)
and 63.56 +- 11 bits/min (letter level) with webcam in synchronous mode. The
system demonstrated good usability and low workload with webcam input,
highlighting its user-centred design and promise as an accessible communication
tool in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 生成式AI的快速发展改变了技术设计方式，但AI系统决策可能对残障用户产生不成比例的影响，需要了解AI从业者如何考虑可访问性问题

Method: 对25名跨角色AI从业者（工程、研究、UX、负责任AI）进行访谈研究，分析工作流程和产出物对残障用户的影响

Result: 发现从业者在负责任AI与可访问性实践交叉点遇到摩擦，面临指南矛盾，缺乏残障用户数据，依赖公司内部非正式志愿者和社区团体来支持残障利益相关者

Conclusion: 需要开发新的资源和改进流程来更好地支持AI系统中的残障用户，弥合可访问性与负责任AI实践之间的差距

Abstract: The rapid emergence of generative AI has changed the way that technology is
designed, constructed, maintained, and evaluated. Decisions made when creating
AI-powered systems may impact some users disproportionately, such as people
with disabilities. In this paper, we report on an interview study with 25 AI
practitioners across multiple roles (engineering, research, UX, and responsible
AI) about how their work processes and artifacts may impact end users with
disabilities. We found that practitioners experienced friction when triaging
problems at the intersection of responsible AI and accessibility practices,
navigated contradictions between accessibility and responsible AI guidelines,
identified gaps in data about users with disabilities, and gathered support for
addressing the needs of disabled stakeholders by leveraging informal volunteer
and community groups within their company. Based on these findings, we offer
suggestions for new resources and process changes to better support people with
disabilities as end users of AI.

Motivation: AI社交媒体推荐系统虽然能改善用户体验，但经常与用户兴趣不匹配且缺乏透明度，存在可理解性问题，需要从终端用户角度进行研究

Method: 使用Facebook平台招募普通用户进行定性分析，询问参与者关于社交媒体内容推荐、可理解性和可解释性的看法

Result: 分析显示用户主要在不熟悉内容和确保在线数据安全时需要解释，要求简洁、非技术性的解释以及可控的信息流功能，解释影响用户对透明度、信任和理解度的感知

Conclusion: 提出了设计启示并基于数据分析构建了一个综合框架，强调了用户友好的解释机制对提升社交媒体推荐系统体验的重要性

Abstract: AI based social media recommendations have great potential to improve the
user experience. However, often these recommendations do not match the user
interest and create an unpleasant experience for the users. Moreover, the
recommendation system being a black box creates comprehensibility and
transparency issues. This paper investigates social media recommendations from
an end user perspective. For the investigation, we used the popular social
media platform Facebook and recruited regular users to conduct a qualitative
analysis. We asked participants about the social media content suggestions,
their comprehensibility, and explainability. Our analysis shows users mostly
require explanation whenever they encounter unfamiliar content and to ensure
their online data security. Furthermore, the users require concise,
non-technical explanations along with the facility of controlled information
flow. In addition, we observed that explanations impact the users perception of
transparency, trust, and understandability. Finally, we have outlined some
design implications and presented a synthesized framework based on our data
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HRI研究多在受控环境中进行，而真实公共空间具有不可预测性和多样性，需要研究如何让社交机器人更好地融入日常公共空间

Method: 在大型工作教堂和旅游景点进行为期三天的试点部署，观察和分析与机器人交互的非典型用户行为模式

Result: 发现了公共空间中罕见的人机交互异常情况，识别了不同类型的非典型用户行为模式

Conclusion: 提供了公共空间人机交互的实证见解，为社交机器人设计师提供了实用的部署策略和未来技术发展方向

Abstract: Though a goal of HRI is the natural integration of social robots into
everyday public spaces, real-world studies still occur mostly within controlled
environments with predetermined participants. True public spaces present an
environment which is largely unconstrained and unpredictable, frequented by a
diverse range of people whose goals can often conflict with those of the robot.
When combined with the general unfamiliarity most people have with social
robots, this leads to unexpected human-robot interactions in these public
spaces that are rarely discussed or detected in other contexts. In this paper,
we describe atypical users we observed interacting with our robot, and those
who did not, during a three-day pilot deployment within a large working church
and visitor attraction. We then discuss theoretical future advances in the
field that could address these challenges, as well as immediate practical
mitigations and strategies to help improve public space human-robot
interactions in the present. This work contributes empirical insights into the
dynamics of human-robot interaction in public environments and offers
actionable guidance for more effective future deployments for social robot
designers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有研究依赖自我报告数据存在偏差，以及需要长期数据才能预测学业成绩而无法早期干预的问题

Method: 开发了一款应用，在1秒内获取过去7天的实际应用使用数据，并对124名孟加拉国学生进行分析，使用机器学习模型预测CGPA

Result: 应用使用会话与CGPA呈显著负相关，生产力和图书类应用呈显著正相关，视频类应用呈显著负相关，高低CGPA学生的应用使用行为存在显著差异

Conclusion: 仅需短期实际应用使用数据即可准确预测学业成绩，这为早期干预提高学业表现提供了可能

Abstract: Due to usage of self-reported data which may contain biasness, the existing
studies may not unveil the exact relation between academic grades and app
categories such as Video. Additionally, the existing systems' requirement for
data of prolonged period to predict grades may not facilitate early
intervention to improve it. Thus, we presented an app that retrieves past 7
days' actual app usage data within a second (Mean=0.31s, SD=1.1s). Our analysis
on 124 Bangladeshi students' real-time data demonstrates app usage sessions
have a significant (p<0.05) negative association with CGPA. However, the
Productivity and Books categories have a significant positive association
whereas Video has a significant negative association. Moreover, the high and
low CGPA holders have significantly different app usage behavior. Leveraging
only the instantly accessed data, our machine learning model predicts CGPA
within 0.36 of the actual CGPA. We discuss the design implications that can be
potential for students to improve grades.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究假设在文本中提供分割信息可以通过降低计算成本来帮助阅读过程，探索不同视觉干预如何传达分割信息以促进阅读和词汇识别。

Method: 进行了预注册的词汇决策实验，192名参与者测试了五种视觉分割类型：轮廓、间距、连接、下划线和颜色。

Result: 证据表明，即使经过适度训练，这些视觉干预总是会减慢单词识别速度，但程度各不相同。无法加速词汇决策任务。

Conclusion: 研究为常见的文本视觉操作提供了成本测量，揭示了排版编码信息与视觉变量之间的独特交互模式，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: When a reader encounters a word in English, they split the word into smaller
orthographic units in the process of recognizing its meaning. For example,
"rough", when split according to phonemes, is decomposed as r-ou-gh (not as
r-o-ugh or r-ough), where each group of letters corresponds to a sound. Since
there are many ways to segment a group of letters, this constitutes a
computational operation that has to be solved by the reading brain, many times
per minute, in order to achieve the recognition of words in text necessary for
reading. We hypothesized that providing segmentation information in the text
itself could help the reading process by reducing its computational cost. In
this paper we explore whether and how different visual interventions could
communicate segmentation information for reading and word recognition. We ran a
series of pre-registered lexical decision experiments with 192 participants
that tested five types of visual segmentations: outlines, spacing, connections,
underlines and color. The evidence indicates that, even with a moderate amount
of training, these visual interventions always slow down word identification,
but each to a different extent. These findings are important because they
indicate that, at least for typical adult readers with a moderate amount of
specific training in these visual interventions, accelerating the lexical
decision task is unlikely. The results also offer an empirical measurement of
the cost of a common set of visual manipulations of text, which can be useful
for practitioners seeking to visualize alongside or within text without
impacting reading performance. Finally, the interaction between typographically
encoded information and visual variables presented unique patterns that deviate
from existing theories, suggesting new directions for future inquiry.

Result: 真实用户研究显示top-1准确率达到71.35%，能够持续提升准确率和推理速度，用户满意度高且优于手动操作

Conclusion: TextOnly相比语音助手支持更广泛的文本相关功能，允许更简洁的输入，是一个有效的统一功能门户解决方案

Abstract: Text boxes serve as portals to diverse functionalities in today's smartphone
applications. However, when it comes to specific functionalities, users always
need to navigate through multiple steps to access particular text boxes for
input. We propose TextOnly, a unified function portal that enables users to
access text-related functions from various applications by simply inputting
text into a sole text box. For instance, entering a restaurant name could
trigger a Google Maps search, while a greeting could initiate a conversation in
WhatsApp. Despite their brevity, TextOnly maximizes the utilization of these
raw text inputs, which contain rich information, to interpret user intentions
effectively. TextOnly integrates large language models(LLM) and a BERT model.
The LLM consistently provides general knowledge, while the BERT model can
continuously learn user-specific preferences and enable quicker predictions.
Real-world user studies demonstrated TextOnly's effectiveness with a top-1
accuracy of 71.35%, and its ability to continuously improve both its accuracy
and inference speed. Participants perceived TextOnly as having satisfactory
usability and expressed a preference for TextOnly over manual executions.
Compared with voice assistants, TextOnly supports a greater range of
text-related functions and allows for more concise inputs.

Method: 基于家长经验方法开发了六种认知发展策略，整合到SCENIC系统中。系统包含动态兴趣点选择和旅程画廊生成功能，通过位置基础策略帮助儿童感知环境

Result: 对生成内容进行了评估(N=21)，并对7个家庭10名儿童进行了现场用户研究。结果表明SCENIC能增强乘车体验，帮助儿童更好地与周围环境建立连接

Conclusion: SCENIC系统成功解决了儿童乘车时的无聊问题，有效利用外部环境资源促进认知发展，为日常通勤提供了有价值的互动教育解决方案

Abstract: Car-riding is common for children in modern life. Given the repetitive nature
of daily commutes, they often feel bored and turn to electronic devices for
entertainment. Meanwhile, the rich and dynamic scenery outside the car
naturally attracts children's curiosity and offers valuable resources for
cognitive development. Our formative study reveals that parents' support during
car rides is often fleeting, as accompanying adults may struggle to
consistently guide children's exploration. To address this, we propose SCENIC,
an interactive system that helps children aged 6 to 11 better perceive the
external environment using location-based cognitive development strategies.
SCENIC builds upon experiential approaches used by parents, resulting in six
strategies embedded into the system. To improve engagement during routine
rides, SCENIC also incorporates dynamic point-of-interest selection and journey
gallery generation. We evaluated the generated content (N=21) and conducted an
in-situ user study with seven families and ten children. Results suggest that
SCENIC enhances the car-riding experience and helps children better connect
with their surroundings.

Motivation: 迫切需要可靠、文化验证的工具来评估对AI和大型语言模型的心理反应，特别是在阿拉伯语人群中，AI采用正在加速但心理测量工具仍然有限

Method: 250名阿拉伯参与者完成阿拉伯语版LLM-D12量表，使用验证性因子分析确认因子结构，并评估内部信度和外部效度

Result: 验证性因子分析确认了原有的2因子结构，量表显示出良好到优秀的内部信度（总α=0.90），工具性依赖与AI接受度和网络成瘾正相关，关系性依赖与较低认知需求和更高信任度相关

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语LLM-D12是一个心理测量学上可靠、文化适宜的工具，为阿拉伯语境中AI和LLM参与的研究、教育和政策提供了必要工具

Abstract: There is an urgent need for reliable, culturally validated instruments to
assess psychological responses to AI in general and large language models
(LLMs). This need is global issue, but it is especially urgent among
Arabic-speaking populations, where AI and LLMs adoption is accelerating, yet
psychometric tools remain limited. This study presents the first validation of
the LLM-D12, a dual-dimensional scale assessing Instrumental and Relationship
Dependency on LLMs, in an Arab sample. A total of 250 Arab participants
completed the Arabic version of the LLM-D12. Confirmatory Factor Analysis
confirms the original 2-factor structure of LLM-D12 with all items showing good
loading of corresponding Instrumental and Relationship Dependency. The scale
showed good to excellent internal reliability (Cronbach alpha is 0.90 for
Total, 0.85 for Instrumental Dependency, and 0.90 for Relationship Dependency).
External validation revealed that Instrumental Dependency was positively
associated with AI acceptance and internet addiction, while Relationship
Dependency was linked to lower need for cognition and greater trustworthiness
of LLM, demonstrating sensitivity of this instrument to different use and
personal factors. These findings confirm that Arabic LLM-D12 is a
psychometrically sound, culturally appropriate instrument, offering a necessary
tool for research, education, and policy concerning AI and LLMs engagement in
Arab contexts.

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential mode of communication for Deaf and
Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals. Its education remains limited by the lack of
qualified instructors, insufficient early exposure, and the inadequacy of
traditional teaching methods. Recent advances in Virtual Reality (VR) and
Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer promising new approaches to enhance sign
language learning through immersive, interactive, and feedback-rich
environments. This paper presents a systematic review of 55 peer-reviewed
studies on VR-based sign language education, identifying and analyzing five
core thematic areas: (1) gesture recognition and real-time feedback mechanisms;
(2) interactive VR environments for communicative practice; (3) gamification
for immersive and motivating learning experiences; (4) personalized and
adaptive learning systems; and (5) accessibility and inclusivity for diverse
DHH learners.
  The results reveal that AI-driven gesture recognition systems integrated with
VR can provide real-time feedback, significantly improving learner engagement
and performance. However, the analysis highlights critical challenges: hardware
limitations, inconsistent accuracy in gesture recognition, and a lack of
inclusive and adaptive design. This review contributes a comprehensive
synthesis of technological and pedagogical innovations in the field, outlining
current limitations and proposing actionable recommendations for developers and
researchers. By bridging technical advancement with inclusive pedagogy, this
review lays the foundation for next-generation VR systems that are equitable,
effective, and accessible for sign language learners worldwide.

Motivation: 许多可视化设计启发式指南来自特定任务或可视化类型，缺乏对约束条件和适用范围的考虑。本研究旨在用成熟的心理学知识评估现有的分类可视化设计启发式。

Method: 进行了三个实验，使用2到15个类别的多类散点图，涵盖类别估计、相关性比较和聚类判断三个不同任务，分析类别数量增加时性能变化。

Result: 当类别数小于6时，人们在所有任务中表现良好，证实了可视化中的亚计数现象。类别数增加时性能下降，下降幅度取决于任务和编码方式。

Conclusion: 研究通过应用成熟的心理学理论弥合了启发式指南与实证证据之间的差距，为利用心理学理论和构念来表征可视化感知提供了未来机会。

Abstract: Understanding how people perceive visualizations is crucial for designing
effective visual data representations; however, many heuristic design
guidelines are derived from specific tasks or visualization types, without
considering the constraints or conditions under which those guidelines hold. In
this work, we aimed to assess existing design heuristics for categorical
visualization using well-established psychological knowledge. Specifically, we
examine the impact of the subitizing phenomenon in cognitive psychology --
people's ability to automatically recognize a small set of objects instantly
without counting -- in data visualizations. We conducted three experiments with
multi-class scatterplots -- between 2 and 15 classes with varying design
choices -- across three different tasks -- class estimation, correlation
comparison, and clustering judgments -- to understand how performance changes
as the number of classes (and therefore set size) increases. Our results
indicate if the category number is smaller than six, people tend to perform
well at all tasks, providing empirical evidence of subitizing in visualization.
When category numbers increased, performance fell, with the magnitude of the
performance change depending on task and encoding. Our study bridges the gap
between heuristic guidelines and empirical evidence by applying
well-established psychological theories, suggesting future opportunities for
using psychological theories and constructs to characterize visualization
perception.

*Arran Zeyu Wang,David Borland,David Gotz*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文主张在医疗健康数据分析中加强可视化分析研究，以解决从观察数据推断因果关系的挑战，推动数据驱动的因果感知医疗实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模纵向健康数据的分析存在关键差距：观察到的模式与真实因果机制之间的差异。准确理解医疗状态变化的因果机制对医疗决策至关重要，但从现实世界观察数据推断因果关系面临方法学和实践挑战。

Method: 倡导增加可视化分析(VA)研究，开发能够增强人类专业知识的新型VA工具，提供直观且稳健的因果推理能力，以应对医疗数据的复杂性（体量大、多样性、稀疏性和时间性）。

Result: 认识到现有因果推理方法在医疗环境中的局限性，包括时间约束和传统医疗工作实践带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 可视化分析研究的进展可以促成新的VA工具，实现数据驱动、因果感知的医疗实践新范式，从而改善人类健康结果。

Abstract: The increasing capture and analysis of large-scale longitudinal health data
offer opportunities to improve healthcare and advance medical understanding.
However, a critical gap exists between (a) -- the observation of patterns and
correlations, versus (b) -- the understanding of true causal mechanisms that
drive outcomes. An accurate understanding of the underlying mechanisms that
cause various changes in medical status is crucial for decision-makers across
various healthcare domains and roles, yet inferring causality from real-world
observational data is difficult for both methodological and practical
challenges. This Grand Challenge advocates increased Visual Analytics (VA)
research on this topic to empower people with the tool for sound causal
reasoning from health data. We note this is complicated by the complex nature
of medical data -- the volume, variety, sparsity, and temporality of health
data streams make the use of causal inference algorithms difficult. Combined
with challenges imposed by the realities of health-focused settings, including
time constraints and traditional medical work practices, existing causal
reasoning approaches are valuable but insufficient. We argue that advances in
research can lead to new VA tools that augment human expertise with intuitive
and robust causal inference capabilities, which can help realize a new paradigm
of data-driven, causality-aware healthcare practices that improve human health
outcomes.

TL;DR: SonoCraftAR是一个概念验证原型，允许聋人和听力障碍用户通过自然语言输入创建自定义的声音响应式AR界面，实现个性化的声音可视化。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的AR系统虽然能够为聋人和听力障碍人士提供语音字幕和环境声音可视化，但缺乏让用户创建个性化声音可视化界面的能力。

Method: 系统整合实时音频信号处理与多智能体LLM流水线，通过矢量图形库程序化生成动画2D界面。提取音频主导频率并映射到视觉属性（如大小和颜色），使可视化效果动态响应声音。

Result: 证明了开放式声音响应式AR界面创作工具的可行性，系统能够根据自然语言输入生成定制化的声音可视化效果。

Conclusion: 这项早期探索展示了AI辅助工具在改善声音可访问性方面的潜力，为未来个性化声音可视化工具的开发提供了机会。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) has shown promise for supporting Deaf and
hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals by captioning speech and visualizing
environmental sounds, yet existing systems do not allow users to create
personalized sound visualizations. We present SonoCraftAR, a proof-of-concept
prototype that empowers DHH users to author custom sound-reactive AR interfaces
using typed natural language input. SonoCraftAR integrates real-time audio
signal processing with a multi-agent LLM pipeline that procedurally generates
animated 2D interfaces via a vector graphics library. The system extracts the
dominant frequency of incoming audio and maps it to visual properties such as
size and color, making the visualizations respond dynamically to sound. This
early exploration demonstrates the feasibility of open-ended sound-reactive AR
interface authoring and discusses future opportunities for personalized,
AI-assisted tools to improve sound accessibility.

TL;DR: SEAM系统使用虚拟化身代表缺席用户参与VR会议，让参会者可以与化身互动，缺席用户后续可从化身视角观看录像并回应，通过两个混合方法研究验证了该方案对在场和缺席用户都有益处


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决远程协作中用户因时区差异或其他原因无法同步参会的问题，让缺席用户也能有效参与会议决策过程

Method: 采用Wizard-of-Oz方法进行两个混合方法研究，共45名参与者，分别从现场参会者和缺席用户两个角度评估SEAM系统的用户体验

Result: 现场参会者能够轻松获取决策信息并感知到缺席者的高社交存在感；缺席用户在观看录像时因社交互动和关注而感到被包含；系统证明未来异步会议可以实现更接近同步会议的对话式交互

Conclusion: SEAM系统通过虚拟化身代表缺席用户的方案有效增强了会议体验，为未来异步协作会议提供了可行的概念验证，使协作更接近同步会议的交互质量

Abstract: We propose and explore the user experience of SEAM -- Stand-in Enhanced
Asynchronous Meetings -- virtual reality meetings in which embodied virtual
agents represent absent users. During the meeting, attendees can address the
agent, and the absent user can later watch the recording from its perspective
to respond. Through two mixed-method studies with 45 participants using the
Wizard-of-Oz approach, we explored both the perspectives of the attendees in
the original meeting and of the absent users later re-watching the meeting. We
found that the stand-in can enhance meetings, benefiting both present and
absent collaborators. Present attendees can easily access information that
drives decision-making in the meeting perceive high social presence of
absentees. Absentees also felt included when watching recordings because of the
social interactions and attention towards them. Our contributions demonstrate a
proof of concept for future asynchronous meetings in which collaborators can
interact conversationally more akin to how they would if it had been
synchronous.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对自动驾驶中用户信任和舒适度的分析存在分离、实时评估有限和多模态数据不足的问题，需要更全面的数据集来支持自适应AV系统开发

Method: 创建TRUCE-AV数据集，收集31名参与者在模拟自动驾驶中的实时信任投票和连续舒适度评分，同步记录心率、注视、情绪等生理信号以及车速、周围车辆位置等环境数据，并使用机器学习模型进行评估

Result: 基于树模型（随机森林、XGBoost）和非线性模型（KNN、MLP回归器）在信任分类和舒适度回归任务中表现最佳，通过SHAP分析识别了关键特征

Conclusion: 该数据集支持开发能够非侵入式动态响应用户信任和舒适度的自适应AV系统，有助于提升安全性、用户体验和以人为本的车辆设计

Abstract: Understanding and estimating driver trust and comfort are essential for the
safety and widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Existing works analyze
user trust and comfort separately, with limited real-time assessment and
insufficient multimodal data. This paper introduces a novel multimodal dataset
called TRUCE-AV, focusing on trust and comfort estimation in autonomous
vehicles. The dataset collects real-time trust votes and continuous comfort
ratings of 31 participants during a simulator-based fully autonomous driving.
Simultaneously, physiological signals, such as heart rate, gaze, and emotions,
along with environmental data (e.g., vehicle speed, nearby vehicle positions,
and velocity), are recorded throughout the drives. Standard pre- and post-drive
questionnaires were also administered to assess participants' trust in
automation and overall well-being, enabling the correlation of subjective
assessments with real-time responses. To demonstrate the utility of our
dataset, we evaluated various machine learning models for trust and comfort
estimation using physiological data. Our analysis showed that tree-based models
like Random Forest and XGBoost and non-linear models such as KNN and MLP
regressor achieved the best performance for trust classification and comfort
regression. Additionally, we identified key features that contribute to these
estimations by using SHAP analysis on the top-performing models. Our dataset
enables the development of adaptive AV systems capable of dynamically
responding to user trust and comfort levels non-invasively, ultimately
enhancing safety, user experience, and human-centered vehicle design.

Abstract: With the rapid increase in online interactions, concerns over data privacy
and transparency of data processing practices have become more pronounced.
While regulations like the GDPR have driven the widespread adoption of cookie
banners in the EU, India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA)
promises similar changes domestically, aiming to introduce a framework for data
protection. However, certain clauses within the DPDPA raise concerns about
potential infringements on user privacy, given the exemptions for government
accountability and user consent requirements. In this study, for the first
time, we explore Indian Internet users' awareness and perceptions of cookie
banners, online privacy, and privacy regulations, especially in light of the
newly passed DPDPA. We conducted an online anonymous survey with 428 Indian
participants, which addressed: (1) users' perspectives on cookie banners, (2)
their attitudes towards online privacy and privacy regulations, and (3) their
acceptance of 10 contentious DPDPA clauses that favor state authorities and may
enable surveillance. Our findings reveal that privacy-conscious users often
lack consistent awareness of privacy mechanisms, and their concerns do not
always lead to protective actions. Our thematic analysis of 143 open ended
responses shows that users' privacy and data protection concerns are rooted in
skepticism towards the government, shaping their perceptions of the DPDPA and
fueling demands for policy revisions. Our study highlights the need for clearer
communication regarding the DPDPA, user-centric consent mechanisms, and policy
refinements to enhance data privacy practices in India.

Abstract: The ability to speak is an inherent part of human nature and fundamental to
our existence as a social species. Unfortunately, this ability can be
restricted in certain situations, such as for individuals who have lost their
voice or in environments where speaking aloud is unsuitable. Additionally, some
people may prefer not to speak audibly due to privacy concerns. For such cases,
silent speech interfaces have been proposed, which focus on processing
biosignals corresponding to silently produced speech. These interfaces enable
synthesis of audible speech from biosignals that are produced when speaking
silently and recognition aka decoding of biosignals into text that corresponds
to the silently produced speech. While recognition and synthesis of silent
speech has been a prominent focus in many research studies, there is a
significant gap in deriving paralinguistic information such as affective states
from silent speech. To fill this gap, we propose Silent Paralinguistics, aiming
to predict paralinguistic information from silent speech and ultimately
integrate it into the reconstructed audible voice for natural communication.
This survey provides a comprehensive look at methods, research strategies, and
objectives within the emerging field of silent paralinguistics.

Motivation: 推荐系统中用户模拟对系统开发和评估至关重要，但现有LLM缺乏领域对齐且效率不足，而大量用户反馈资源未被充分利用

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用LLM生成认知决策过程减少原始反馈模糊性；2) 基于不确定性估计和行为采样的数据蒸馏过滤挑战性但去噪的模拟样本

Result: 实验验证该框架显著提升了微调LLM与人类偏好的对齐度和领域推理能力，提供了更有洞察力和可解释的交互信号

Conclusion: 该工作将推动推荐系统社区发展，并为更广泛的人类中心AI研究提供宝贵见解

Abstract: User simulation is increasingly vital to develop and evaluate recommender
systems (RSs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to
simulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain
alignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale
simulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is
the extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such
feedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is
often ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference
alignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the
efficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering
mechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we
introduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in
RSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data.
Our framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate
cognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing
ambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty
estimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation
samples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using
such high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes.
Extensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the
alignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of
fine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when
interacting with RSs. We believe our work will advance the RS community and
offer valuable insights for broader human-centric AI research.

Result: 开发了交互式原型系统，通过案例研究和用户实验验证了框架和系统的实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: InReAcTable框架能够有效指导用户构建符合分析需求的可视化数据故事，解决了现有方法在效率和目标捕捉方面的局限性。

Abstract: Insights in tabular data capture valuable patterns that help analysts
understand critical information. Organizing related insights into visual data
stories is crucial for in-depth analysis. However, constructing such stories is
challenging because of the complexity of the inherent relations between
extracted insights. Users face difficulty sifting through a vast number of
discrete insights to integrate specific ones into a unified narrative that
meets their analytical goals. Existing methods either heavily rely on user
expertise, making the process inefficient, or employ automated approaches that
cannot fully capture their evolving goals. In this paper, we introduce
InReAcTable, a framework that enhances visual data story construction by
establishing both structural and semantic connections between data insights.
Each user interaction triggers the Acting module, which utilizes an insight
graph for structural filtering to narrow the search space, followed by the
Reasoning module using the retrieval-augmented generation method based on large
language models for semantic filtering, ultimately providing insight
recommendations aligned with the user's analytical intent. Based on the
InReAcTable framework, we develop an interactive prototype system that guides
users to construct visual data stories aligned with their analytical
requirements. We conducted a case study and a user experiment to demonstrate
the utility and effectiveness of the InReAcTable framework and the prototype
system for interactively building visual data stories.

engineering, the chatbot maintained a recognizable and consistent persona and
had a distinct personality based on the Big Five Personality test. These
results support the idea that prompt engineering can be used to simulate stable
personality characteristics in AI chatbots.

Abstract: Caregivers of people living with dementia (PLwD) experience stress when
verifying whether tasks are truly completed, even with digital reminder
systems. Generative AI, such as GPT-4, may help by automating task verification
through follow-up questioning and decision support.
  This feasibility study evaluates an AI-powered task verification system
integrated with digital reminders for PLwD. It examines (1) GPT-4's ability to
generate effective follow-up questions, (2) the accuracy of an AI-driven
response flagging mechanism, and (3) the role of caregiver feedback in refining
system adaptability. A simulated pipeline was tested on 64 anonymized
reminders. GPT-4 generated follow-up questions with and without contextual
information about PLwD routines. Responses were classified into High, Medium,
or Low concern, and simulated caregiver feedback was used to refine outputs.
  Results show that contextual information and caregiver input improved the

identified concerns, particularly for safety-critical tasks, though subjective

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometry acquisition is essential for a wide range of
applications, such as computer graphics, autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. However, raw point clouds acquired in real-world
environments are often corrupted with noise due to various factors such as
sensor, lighting, material, environment etc, which reduces geometric fidelity
and degrades downstream performance. Point cloud denoising is a fundamental
problem, aiming to recover clean point sets while preserving underlying
structures. Classical optimization-based methods, guided by hand-crafted
filters or geometric priors, have been extensively studied but struggle to
handle diverse and complex noise patterns. Recent deep learning approaches
leverage neural network architectures to learn distinctive representations and
demonstrate strong outcomes, particularly on complex and large-scale point
clouds. Provided these significant advances, this survey provides a
comprehensive and up-to-date review of deep learning-based point cloud
denoising methods up to August 2025. We organize the literature from two
perspectives: (1) supervision level (supervised vs. unsupervised), and (2)
modeling perspective, proposing a functional taxonomy that unifies diverse
approaches by their denoising principles. We further analyze architectural
trends both structurally and chronologically, establish a unified benchmark
with consistent training settings, and evaluate methods in terms of denoising
quality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency.
Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline directions for future research
in this rapidly evolving field.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了音乐驱动的迭代可编辑舞蹈生成，为实际编舞应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Generating coherent and diverse human dances from music signals has gained
tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While existing methods
support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to
edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography
scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating
iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal,
we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset
comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In
addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance
generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.
Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable
iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a
prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the
initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated
results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music.
Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text
descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a
specifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM
adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as
temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results
display music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with
text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix
dataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/.

Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for virtual
and augmented reality systems, but rely on advanced computer-generated
holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns
that can be displayed on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Gaussian Wave
Splatting (GWS) has recently emerged as a powerful CGH paradigm that allows for
the conversion of Gaussians, a state-of-the-art neural 3D representation, into
holograms. However, GWS assumes smooth-phase distributions over the Gaussian
primitives, limiting their ability to model view-dependent effects and
reconstruct accurate defocus blur, and severely under-utilizing the
space-bandwidth product of the SLM. In this work, we propose random-phase GWS
(GWS-RP) to improve bandwidth utilization, which has the effect of increasing
eyebox size, reconstructing accurate defocus blur and parallax, and supporting
time-multiplexed rendering to suppress speckle artifacts.
  At the core of GWS-RP are (1) a fundamentally new wavefront compositing
procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme specifically designed for
random-phase Gaussian primitives, ensuring physically correct color
reconstruction and robust occlusion handling. Additionally, we present the
first formally derived algorithm for applying random phase to Gaussian
primitives, grounded in rigorous statistical optics analysis and validated
through practical near-eye display applications. Through extensive simulations
and experimental validations, we demonstrate that these advancements,
collectively with time-multiplexing, uniquely enables full-bandwith light field
CGH that supports accurate accurate parallax and defocus, yielding
state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for
next-generation near-eye displays.

Conclusion: 该方法通过模块化设计和分阶段训练，有效解决了参考与草图不对齐导致的着色质量问题，提供了灵活的推理模式，适用于多种使用场景。

Abstract: Reference-based sketch colorization methods have garnered significant
attention for the potential application in animation and digital illustration
production. However, most existing methods are trained with image triplets of
sketch, reference, and ground truth that are semantically and spatially
similar, while real-world references and sketches often exhibit substantial
misalignment. This mismatch in data distribution between training and inference
leads to overfitting, consequently resulting in artifacts and signif- icant
quality degradation in colorization results. To address this issue, we conduct
an in-depth analysis of the reference representations, defined as the
intermedium to transfer information from reference to sketch. Building on this
analysis, we introduce a novel framework that leverages distinct reference
representations to optimize different aspects of the colorization process. Our
approach decomposes colorization into modular stages, al- lowing
region-specific reference injection to enhance visual quality and reference
similarity while mitigating spatial artifacts. Specifically, we first train a
backbone network guided by high-level semantic embeddings. We then introduce a
background encoder and a style encoder, trained in separate stages, to enhance
low-level feature transfer and improve reference similar- ity. This design also
enables flexible inference modes suited for a variety of use cases. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluations, together with a user study,
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to
existing approaches. Code and pre-trained weight will be made publicly
available upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法成功弥合了AI生成内容与参数化设计工作流之间的鸿沟，为3D-AIGC在实际设计应用中的落地提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D artificial intelligence-generated content (3D-AIGC) has
enabled rapid synthesis of intricate geometries. However, a fundamental
disconnect persists between AI-generated content and human-centric design
paradigms, rooted in representational incompatibilities: conventional AI
frameworks predominantly manipulate meshes or neural representations
(\emph{e.g.}, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting), while designers operate within
parametric modeling tools. This disconnection diminishes the practical value of
AI for 3D industry, undermining the efficiency of human-AI collaboration. To
resolve this disparity, we focus on generating design operation sequences,
which are structured modeling histories that comprehensively capture the
step-by-step construction process of 3D assets and align with designers'
typical workflows in modern 3D software. We first reformulate fundamental
modeling operations (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Extrude}, \emph{Boolean}) into
differentiable units, enabling joint optimization of continuous (\emph{e.g.},
\emph{Extrude} height) and discrete (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Boolean} type)
parameters via gradient-based learning. Based on these differentiable
operations, a hierarchical graph with gating mechanism is constructed and
optimized end-to-end by minimizing Chamfer Distance to target geometries.
Multi-stage sequence length constraint and domain rule penalties enable
unsupervised learning of compact design sequences without ground-truth sequence
supervision. Extensive validation demonstrates that the generated operation
sequences achieve high geometric fidelity, smooth mesh wiring, rational step
composition and flexible editing capacity, with full compatibility within
design industry.

Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and
graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover
accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address
this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface
reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage
2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric
priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.
Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view
pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images
and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve
the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted
Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping
areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the
orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal
estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed
improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks. Project

Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have become the most popular tool for solving
widely-existed multi-objective optimization problems. In Multi-Objective EAs
(MOEAs), there is increasing interest in using an archive to store
non-dominated solutions generated during the search. This approach can 1)
mitigate the effects of population oscillation, a common issue in many MOEAs,
and 2) allow for the use of smaller, more practical population sizes. In this
paper, we analytically show that the archive can even further help MOEAs
through reusing its solutions during the process of new solution generation. We
first prove that using a small population size alongside an archive (without
incorporating archived solutions in the generation process) may fail on certain
problems, as the population may remove previously discovered but promising
solutions. We then prove that reusing archive solutions can overcome this
limitation, resulting in at least a polynomial speedup on the expected running
time. Our analysis focuses on the well-established SMS-EMOA algorithm applied
to the commonly studied OneJumpZeroJump problem as well as one of its variants.
We also show that reusing archive solutions can be better than using a large
population size directly. Finally, we show that our theoretical findings can
generally hold in practice by experiments on four well-known practical
optimization problems -- multi-objective 0-1 Knapsack, TSP, QAP and
NK-landscape problems -- with realistic settings.

Abstract: Arc-routing problems underpin numerous critical field operations, including
power-line inspection, urban police patrolling, and traffic monitoring. In this
domain, the Rural Postman Problem (RPP) is a fundamental variant in which a
prescribed subset of edges or arcs in a network must be traversed. This paper
investigates a generalized form of the RPP, called RPP-mTD, which involves a
fleet of multiple trucks, each carrying multiple drones. The trucks act as
mobile depots traversing a road network, from which drones are launched to
execute simultaneous service, with the objective of minimizing the overall
makespan. Given the combinatorial complexity of RPP-mTD, we propose a Hybrid
Genetic Algorithm (HGA) that combines population-based exploration with
targeted neighborhood searches. Solutions are encoded using a two-layer
chromosome that represents: (i) an ordered, directed sequence of required
edges, and (ii) their assignment to vehicles. A tailored segment-preserving
crossover operator is introduced, along with multiple local search techniques
to intensify the optimization. We benchmark the proposed HGA against
established single truck-and-drone instances, demonstrating competitive
performance. Additionally, we conduct extensive evaluations on new,
larger-scale instances to demonstrate scalability. Our findings highlight the
operational benefits of closely integrated truck-drone fleets, affirming the
HGA's practical effectiveness as a decision-support tool in advanced
mixed-fleet logistics.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed
a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent
coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While
effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical
limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to
degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited
inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt
concatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information
loss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS
built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol.
Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent
collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results,
identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm
reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and
minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and
cost-efficient execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved
52.73\% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the
strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63\%) by +9.09\% under identical LLM
settings. Our implementation is publicly available at

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning in mixed-motive settings presents a
fundamental challenge: agents must balance individual interests with collective
goals, which are neither fully aligned nor strictly opposed. To address this,
reward restructuring methods such as gifting and intrinsic motivation have been
proposed. However, these approaches primarily focus on promoting cooperation by
managing the trade-off between individual and collective returns, without
explicitly addressing fairness with respect to the agents' task-specific
rewards. In this paper, we propose an adaptive conflict-aware gradient
adjustment method that promotes cooperation while ensuring fairness in
individual rewards. The proposed method dynamically balances policy gradients
derived from individual and collective objectives in situations where the two
objectives are in conflict. By explicitly resolving such conflicts, our method
improves collective performance while preserving fairness across agents. We
provide theoretical results that guarantee monotonic non-decreasing improvement
in both the collective and individual objectives and ensure fairness. Empirical
results in sequential social dilemma environments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms baselines in terms of social welfare while ensuring fairness among
agents.

Abstract: Robotic cloth manipulation suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and
shared datasets for evaluating and comparing different approaches. To address
this, we created a benchmark and organized the ICRA 2024 Cloth Competition, a
unique head-to-head evaluation focused on grasp pose selection for in-air
robotic cloth unfolding. Eleven diverse teams participated in the competition,
utilizing our publicly released dataset of real-world robotic cloth unfolding
attempts and a variety of methods to design their unfolding approaches.
Afterwards, we also expanded our dataset with 176 competition evaluation
trials, resulting in a dataset of 679 unfolding demonstrations across 34
garments. Analysis of the competition results revealed insights about the
trade-off between grasp success and coverage, the surprisingly strong
achievements of hand-engineered methods and a significant discrepancy between
competition performance and prior work, underscoring the importance of
independent, out-of-the-lab evaluation in robotic cloth manipulation. The
associated dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating grasp
selection methods, particularly for learning-based approaches. We hope that our
benchmark, dataset and competition results can serve as a foundation for future
benchmarks and drive further progress in data-driven robotic cloth
manipulation. The dataset and benchmarking code are available at

TL;DR: 比较PPO和SAC两种深度强化学习算法在GPS缺失环境下无人机管道导航的性能，发现PPO表现更稳定可靠


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工检查工业管道基础设施危险且低效，无人机是替代方案但需要鲁棒的控制策略，特别是在GPS缺失环境中

Method: 使用Genesis仿真环境生成程序化管道环境，设计奖励函数引导无人机通过航点并惩罚碰撞，比较PPO和SAC两种DRL算法

Result: PPO学习到稳定策略，完成所有评估无碰撞，轨迹平滑；SAC收敛到次优行为，仅通过初始段就失败

Conclusion: 在危险密集导航中，on-policy方法的训练稳定性优于off-policy算法的样本效率，程序化高保真仿真是开发鲁棒导航策略的有效测试平台

Abstract: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation shafts, is
a hazardous and inefficient task for humans. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
offer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust
control policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
emerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper
provides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the
on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct
environments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed
to guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant
penalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all
evaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By
contrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed
only the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in
hazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can
outweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. More broadly,
the study provides evidence that procedurally generated, high-fidelity
simulations are effective testbeds for developing and benchmarking robust
navigation policies.

Abstract: The fast development of technology and artificial intelligence has
significantly advanced Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research, emphasizing the need
for extensive simulation testing. Accurate and adaptable maps are critical in
AV development, serving as the foundation for localization, path planning, and
scenario testing. However, creating simulation-ready maps is often difficult
and resource-intensive, especially with simulators like CARLA (CAR Learning to
Act). Many existing workflows require significant computational resources or
rely on specific simulators, limiting flexibility for developers. This paper
presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development,
demonstrated through the generation of a 3D map of a parking lot at Ontario
Tech University. Future work will focus on incorporating SLAM technologies,
optimizing the workflow for broader simulator compatibility, and exploring more
flexible handling of latitude and longitude values to enhance map generation
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于李群切空间的广义恒定扭转运动先验，用于解决水下近距离操作中6-DoF运动估计问题，通过SE(3)耦合平移和旋转，提高了轨迹估计的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下近距离操作中，追踪器缺乏目标侧的本体感知，可用的相对观测稀疏、噪声大且不完整，导致因子图最大后验估计在无运动先验时欠约束，目标状态弱连接且方向容易漂移。

Method: 提出了广义恒定扭转运动先验，定义在李群切空间上，确保所有自由度的时序一致性轨迹；在SE(3)中耦合了体坐标系下的平移和旋转。开发了三元因子并推导了基于标准李群操作的闭式雅可比矩阵，可在任意李群轨迹上使用。

Result: 在真实动态对接场景数据集上的验证表明，通过仅USBL和光学相对测量段实现了一致的自目标轨迹估计，相比噪声测量提高了相对跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 该方法基于标准李群原语构建，可跨状态流形和传感模式移植，为水下6-DoF运动估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating a target's 6-DoF motion in underwater proximity operations is
difficult because the chaser lacks target-side proprioception and the available
relative observations are sparse, noisy, and often partial (e.g., Ultra-Short
Baseline (USBL) positions). Without a motion prior, factor-graph maximum a
posteriori estimation is underconstrained: consecutive target states are weakly
linked and orientation can drift. We propose a generalized constant-twist
motion prior defined on the tangent space of Lie groups that enforces
temporally consistent trajectories across all degrees of freedom; in SE(3) it
couples translation and rotation in the body frame. We present a ternary factor
and derive its closed-form Jacobians based on standard Lie group operations,
enabling drop-in use for trajectories on arbitrary Lie groups. We evaluate two
deployment modes: (A) an SE(3)-only representation that regularizes orientation
even when only position is measured, and (B) a mode with boundary factors that
switches the target representation between SE(3) and 3D position while applying
the same generalized constant-twist prior across representation changes.
Validation on a real-world dynamic docking scenario dataset shows consistent
ego-target trajectory estimation through USBL-only and optical relative
measurement segments with an improved relative tracking accuracy compared to
the noisy measurements to the target. Because the construction relies on
standard Lie group primitives, it is portable across state manifolds and
sensing modalities.

Result: 在任务成功率和空间精度方面显著优于现有最先进方法，对未见过的环境和指令具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向能够在现实世界感官约束下执行复杂顺序任务的稳健通用人形智能体迈出的关键一步。

Abstract: We introduce HumanoidVerse, a novel framework for vision-language guided
humanoid control that enables a single physically simulated robot to perform
long-horizon, multi-object rearrangement tasks across diverse scenes. Unlike
prior methods that operate in fixed settings with single-object interactions,
our approach supports consecutive manipulation of multiple objects, guided only
by natural language instructions and egocentric camera RGB observations.
HumanoidVerse is trained via a multi-stage curriculum using a dual-teacher
distillation pipeline, enabling fluid transitions between sub-tasks without
requiring environment resets. To support this, we construct a large-scale
dataset comprising 350 multi-object tasks spanning four room layouts. Extensive
experiments in the Isaac Gym simulator demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art in both task success rate and
spatial precision, and generalizes well to unseen environments and
instructions. Our work represents a key step toward robust, general-purpose
humanoid agents capable of executing complex, sequential tasks under real-world
sensory constraints. The video visualization results can be found on the

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在保持强规划能力的同时，生成多样化且符合指令需求的驾驶轨迹，为自动驾驶提供了更灵活的规划解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in motion planning for autonomous driving have led to models
capable of generating high-quality trajectories. However, most existing
planners tend to fix their policy after supervised training, leading to
consistent but rigid driving behaviors. This limits their ability to reflect
human preferences or adapt to dynamic, instruction-driven demands. In this
work, we propose a diffusion-based multi-head trajectory planner(M-diffusion
planner). During the early training stage, all output heads share weights to
learn to generate high-quality trajectories. Leveraging the probabilistic
nature of diffusion models, we then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to fine-tune the pre-trained model for diverse policy-specific
behaviors. At inference time, we incorporate a large language model (LLM) to
guide strategy selection, enabling dynamic, instruction-aware planning without
switching models. Closed-loop simulation demonstrates that our post-trained
planner retains strong planning capability while achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on the nuPlan val14 benchmark. Open-loop results further
show that the generated trajectories exhibit clear diversity, effectively
satisfying multi-modal driving behavior requirements. The code and related
experiments will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑体协同优化是一个具有挑战性的问题，研究社区对此越来越感兴趣。为了理解和克服这些挑战，需要详尽地映射形态-适应度景观来研究这个问题。

Method: 在包含1,305,840种不同形态的设计空间中，为每个可行形态训练控制器，并在此空间上分析进化脑体协同优化算法的工作方式。

Result: 实验算法无法一致地找到接近最优的解，搜索有时会卡在仅一次突变就能获得更好形态的形态上，算法无法有效跟踪形态-适应度景观中的适应度梯度。算法经常低估具有新突变身体的个体的适应度，从而在整个进化过程中消除有前途的形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了进化脑体协同优化挑战的最具体证明，为文献中的趋势提供了基础，并为未来工作提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Brain-body co-optimization remains a challenging problem, despite increasing
interest from the community in recent years. To understand and overcome the
challenges, we propose exhaustively mapping a morphology-fitness landscape to
study it. To this end, we train controllers for each feasible morphology in a
design space of 1,305,840 distinct morphologies, constrained by a computational
budget. First, we show that this design space constitutes a good model for
studying the brain-body co-optimization problem, and our attempt to
exhaustively map it roughly captures the landscape. We then proceed to analyze
how evolutionary brain-body co-optimization algorithms work in this design
space. The complete knowledge of the morphology-fitness landscape facilitates a
better understanding of the results of evolutionary brain-body co-optimization
algorithms and how they unfold over evolutionary time in the morphology space.
This investigation shows that the experimented algorithms cannot consistently
find near-optimal solutions. The search, at times, gets stuck on morphologies
that are sometimes one mutation away from better morphologies, and the
algorithms cannot efficiently track the fitness gradient in the
morphology-fitness landscape. We provide evidence that experimented algorithms
regularly undervalue the fitness of individuals with newly mutated bodies and,
as a result, eliminate promising morphologies throughout evolution. Our work
provides the most concrete demonstration of the challenges of evolutionary
brain-body co-optimization. Our findings ground the trends in the literature
and provide valuable insights for future work.

Conclusion: HDSim通过结合认知理论和LLM辅助，有效解决了现有交通仿真中驾驶行为多样性和真实性的不足，为自动驾驶系统的可靠性评估提供了更真实的测试环境。

Abstract: Ensuring realistic traffic dynamics is a prerequisite for simulation
platforms to evaluate the reliability of self-driving systems before deployment
in the real world. Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their
diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however,
typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models,
which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited
driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with
large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic
scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the
art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents
diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated
Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape
driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation
improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to
68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.

Abstract: With the rise of modern deep learning, neural networks have become an
essential part of virtually every artificial intelligence system, making it
difficult even to imagine different models for intelligent behavior. In
contrast, nature provides us with many different mechanisms for intelligent
behavior, most of which we have yet to replicate. One of such underinvestigated
aspects of intelligence is embodiment and the role it plays in intelligent
behavior. In this work, we focus on how the simple and fixed behavior of
constituent parts of a simulated physical body can result in an emergent
behavior that can be classified as cognitive by an outside observer.
Specifically, we show how simulated voxels with fixed behaviors can be combined
to create a robot such that, when presented with an image of an MNIST digit
zero, it moves towards the left; and when it is presented with an image of an
MNIST digit one, it moves towards the right. Such robots possess what we refer
to as ``morphological cognition'' -- the ability to perform cognitive behavior
as a result of morphological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first demonstration of a high-level mental faculty such as image
classification performed by a robot without any neural circuitry. We hope that
this work serves as a proof-of-concept and fosters further research into
different models of intelligence.

Conclusion: 该双空间范式能够有效结合两种注册方法的优势，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Rigid registration, aiming to estimate a rigid transformation to align source
and target data, play a crucial role in applications such as SLAM and 3D
reconstruction. However, noisy, partially overlapping data and the need for
real-time processing pose major challenges for rigid registration. Considering
that feature-based matching can handle large transformation differences but
suffers from limited accuracy, while local geometry-based matching can achieve
fine-grained local alignment but relies heavily on a good initial
transformation, we propose a novel dual-space paradigm to fully leverage the
strengths of both approaches. First, we introduce an efficient filtering
mechanism that incorporates a computationally lightweight single-point RANSAC
algorithm followed by a refinement module to eliminate unreliable feature-based
correspondences. Subsequently, we treat filtered correspondences as anchor
points, extract geometric proxies, and formulates an effective objective
function with a tailored solver to estimate the transformation. Experiments
verify our method's effectiveness, as shown by achieving up to a 32x CPU-time
speedup over MAC on KITTI with comparable accuracy.

Abstract: As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming
increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing
path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.
The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory
planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves
maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,
particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based
rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above
challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time
efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance
framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned
trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal
smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the
proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path
adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to
maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility
of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time
efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other
iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the
proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle,
demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.

reduces the inductive biases introduced in the previous similar methods. We
demonstrate that a single-policy LaGarNet achieves flattening on four different
types of garments in both real-world and simulation settings.

Abstract: Adapting trajectories to dynamic situations and user preferences is crucial
for robot operation in unstructured environments with non-expert users. Natural
language enables users to express these adjustments in an interactive manner.
We introduce OVITA, an interpretable, open-vocabulary, language-driven
framework designed for adapting robot trajectories in dynamic and novel
situations based on human instructions. OVITA leverages multiple pre-trained
Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate user commands into trajectories
generated by motion planners or those learned through demonstrations. OVITA
employs code as an adaptation policy generated by an LLM, enabling users to
adjust individual waypoints, thus providing flexible control. Another LLM,
which acts as a code explainer, removes the need for expert users, enabling
intuitive interactions. The efficacy and significance of the proposed OVITA

TL;DR: 一种基于深度学习的框架，通过模拟到实际的方法提升四足机器人搬据能力，减少对实际数据的依赖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决四足机器人在动态场景中进行精确搬据时面临的挑战，包括需要大量实际校准和预编程搬据配置

Method: 在Genesis模拟环境中创建合成数据集，训练基于U-Net结构的CNN模型，处理RGB、深度、分割掩码和法线图等多模态输入，输出搬据质量热力图

Result: 在四足机器人上验证完整框架，成功执行了自主导航、感知、预测最佳搬据姿势和精确搬据的完整任务

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms,
excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional
wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks
the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical
interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to
search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping
in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by
the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp
configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to
enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on
improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real
methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a
pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic
dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of
interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated
grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was
used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes
multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,
depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model
outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We
validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system
successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to
a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp
pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that
leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and
effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: Grasp synthesis is a fundamental task in robotic manipulation which usually
has multiple feasible solutions. Multimodal grasp synthesis seeks to generate
diverse sets of stable grasps conditioned on object geometry, making the robust
learning of geometric features crucial for success. To address this challenge,
we propose a framework for learning multimodal grasp distributions that
leverages variational shape inference to enhance robustness against shape noise
and measurement sparsity. Our approach first trains a variational autoencoder
for shape inference using implicit neural representations, and then uses these
learned geometric features to guide a diffusion model for grasp synthesis on
the SE(3) manifold. Additionally, we introduce a test-time grasp optimization
technique that can be integrated as a plugin to further enhance grasping
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our shape inference for
grasp synthesis formulation outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal grasp
synthesis methods on the ACRONYM dataset by 6.3%, while demonstrating
robustness to deterioration in point cloud density compared to other
approaches. Furthermore, our trained model achieves zero-shot transfer to
real-world manipulation of household objects, generating 34% more successful
grasps than baselines despite measurement noise and point cloud calibration
errors.

Abstract: Developing robotic systems capable of robustly executing long-horizon
manipulation tasks with human-level dexterity is challenging, as such tasks
require both physical dexterity and seamless sequencing of manipulation skills
while robustly handling environment variations. While imitation learning offers
a promising approach, acquiring comprehensive datasets is resource-intensive.
In this work, we propose a learning framework and system LodeStar that
automatically decomposes task demonstrations into semantically meaningful
skills using off-the-shelf foundation models, and generates diverse synthetic
demonstration datasets from a few human demos through reinforcement learning.
These sim-augmented datasets enable robust skill training, with a Skill Routing
Transformer (SRT) policy effectively chaining the learned skills together to
execute complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Experimental evaluations on
three challenging real-world long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图像的世界模型缺乏稳健的几何信息，无法提供一致的空间和物理理解，限制了在机器人操作任务中的表现。

Method: 使用高斯原语推断机器人动作下的传播，结合潜在扩散变换器(DiT)和3D变分自编码器，通过高斯溅射实现场景级未来状态重建。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中，GWM能够精确预测不同机器人动作条件下的未来场景，训练出的策略性能显著超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: GWM展示了3D世界模型在数据扩展方面的潜力，既能增强模仿学习的视觉表示，又能作为支持基于模型强化学习的神经模拟器。

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the
inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world
models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric
information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the
three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To
this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model
(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by
inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot
actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D
variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state
reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual
representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future
prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports
model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments
depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse
robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform
the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling
potential of 3D world model.

TL;DR: 开发了一个开源ROS包，用于在Gazebo模拟器中从RGB相机生成事件流，并研究了基于事件的机器人策略在导航和操作任务中的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 事件相机具有微秒级延迟、高动态范围和低功耗等优势，但在主流机器人模拟器中缺乏合成事件视觉的支持，这阻碍了事件驱动方法在机器人操作和导航任务中的评估。

Method: 提出了一个用户友好的v2e ROS包，能够从RGB相机无缝生成事件流。使用基于Transformer的事件机器人策略，通过行为克隆进行训练，并在移动机器人跟随和机械臂抓取两个场景中与RGB方法进行比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，事件引导的策略在各种操作条件下始终提供竞争优势，证明了事件驱动感知在改善实时机器人导航和操作方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为事件相机更广泛地集成到机器人策略学习中奠定了基础，展示了事件驱动感知在机器人应用中的显著优势。

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond latency, high dynamic range, and low power
consumption, making them ideal for real-time robotic perception under
challenging conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and illumination
changes. However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision
remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of
simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic
manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source,
user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation
that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The
package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time
navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1)
object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with
a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning
and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions.
Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver
competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven
perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing
a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy
learning. The GitHub repo for the dataset and code:

Motivation: 现有开源双足机器人大多依赖3D打印，尺寸扩展性有限且结构脆弱；金属基机器人零件数量多、组装困难。需要开发易于组装、零件易获取的开源双足机器人平台。

Method: 采用钣金焊接技术将复杂几何结构集成到单个零件中，显著减少组件数量；通过仿真中的强化学习和Sim-to-Real迁移技术实现行走控制。

Conclusion: MEVITA提供了一个可行的开源双足机器人解决方案，通过简化制造和组装过程，使更多人能够参与双足机器人的开发和知识共享。

Abstract: Various bipedal robots have been developed to date, and in recent years,
there has been a growing trend toward releasing these robots as open-source
platforms. This shift is fostering an environment in which anyone can freely
develop bipedal robots and share their knowledge, rather than relying solely on
commercial products. However, most existing open-source bipedal robots are
designed to be fabricated using 3D printers, which limits their scalability in
size and often results in fragile structures. On the other hand, some
metal-based bipedal robots have been developed, but they typically involve a
large number of components, making assembly difficult, and in some cases, the
parts themselves are not readily available through e-commerce platforms. To
address these issues, we developed MEVITA, an open-source bipedal robot that
can be built entirely from components available via e-commerce. Aiming for the
minimal viable configuration for a bipedal robot, we utilized sheet metal
welding to integrate complex geometries into single parts, thereby
significantly reducing the number of components and enabling easy assembly for
anyone. Through reinforcement learning in simulation and Sim-to-Real transfer,
we demonstrated robust walking behaviors across various environments,
confirming the effectiveness of our approach. All hardware, software, and
training environments can be obtained from https://github.com/haraduka/mevita .

Motivation: 现实世界中的ASR系统需要处理不完美的音频（硬件限制或环境噪声）并适应多样化的用户群体，在HRI环境中这些挑战交织形成了独特的识别困难。

Method: 使用八个公开数据集评估四个最先进的ASR系统，这些数据集涵盖六个难度维度：领域特定、口音、噪声、年龄变化、语音障碍和自发语音。

Result: 分析显示ASR系统在性能、幻觉倾向和内在偏见方面存在显著差异，尽管在标准基准测试中得分相似。

Conclusion: 这些限制对HRI有严重影响，识别错误会干扰任务性能、用户信任和安全性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in real-world settings need to
handle imperfect audio, often degraded by hardware limitations or environmental
noise, while accommodating diverse user groups. In human-robot interaction
(HRI), these challenges intersect to create a uniquely challenging recognition
environment. We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly
available datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific,
accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis
demonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies,
and inherent biases, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks. These
limitations have serious implications for HRI, where recognition errors can
interfere with task performance, user trust, and safety.

Motivation: 传统轨迹预测模型使用固定长度的输出预测，无法适应动态变化的真实场景，限制了模型的适应性和实用性。

Method: 提出FlexiSteps Network (FSN)框架，包含预训练的自适应预测模块(APM)动态评估和调整输出步长，设计动态解码器(DD)确保即插即用，并采用结合Fréchet距离和预测步长长度的评分机制。

Result: 在Argoverse和INTERACTION等基准数据集上的大量实验证明了FSN框架的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: FSN框架通过动态调整预测时间步长，在保持预测精度的同时提高了模型的适应性和效率，为自动驾驶和智能决策系统提供了更实用的轨迹预测解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and
intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on
fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN),
a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based
on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing
observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN
incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and
adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and
efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic
Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction
accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the
Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted
trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted
steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets
including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 实时多感官错误反馈比回放反馈或无反馈能更有效地提高机器人辅助微创手术培训的学习效果，特别是在环状物定位精度方面表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人辅助微创手术已成为多种手术的金标准，但最佳培训方法尚不明确。研究者假设实时错误反馈比任务后反馈能更快提高学习速度和减少错误

Method: 42名手术新手学习虚拟环线任务，分为三组：实时错误反馈组（触觉和视觉提示）、回放错误反馈组、无错误反馈组，评估环状物位置和方向的准确性

Result: 实时反馈组在环状物方向控制上表现最佳；回放反馈组在直线路径段优于无反馈组；实时反馈组在弯曲路径段的位置准确性最好；整体位置准确性无显著差异

Conclusion: 实时触觉和视觉错误反馈比回放反馈或无反馈能更好地改善虚拟手术任务的学习效果

Abstract: Objective: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) has become the
gold standard for a variety of surgical procedures, but the optimal method of
training surgeons for RMIS is unknown. We hypothesized that real-time, rather
than post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce
errors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the
ring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the
impact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three
groups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and
(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on
the accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who
received real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation.
Additionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed
participants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during
long, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between
groups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time
feedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved
path sections. Conclusion: The addition of real-time haptic and visual error
feedback improves learning outcomes in a virtual surgical task over error
feedback in replay or no error feedback at all. Significance: This work
demonstrates that multi-sensory error feedback delivered in real time leads to
better training outcomes as compared to the same feedback delivered after task
completion. This novel method of training may enable surgical trainees to
develop skills with greater speed and accuracy.

TL;DR: CubeDN是一个专门为无人机3D检测设计的单阶段端到端雷达目标检测网络，采用双雷达配置和深度学习管道，解决了毫米波雷达在高度测量方面的局限性，实现了分米级跟踪精度和实时处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机的广泛使用，需要确保安全和安保。虽然摄像头和光学传感器常用于目标检测，但在恶劣光照和环境条件下性能下降。毫米波雷达虽然可靠，但现有研究主要关注2D道路用户检测，缺乏对无人机3D检测所需的高度测量能力。

Conclusion: CubeDN通过创新的双雷达配置和深度学习架构，成功解决了毫米波雷达在无人机3D检测中的高度测量挑战，为无人机安全监控提供了可靠的技术解决方案。

Abstract: As drone use has become more widespread, there is a critical need to ensure
safety and security. A key element of this is robust and accurate drone
detection and localization. While cameras and other optical sensors like LiDAR
are commonly used for object detection, their performance degrades under
adverse lighting and environmental conditions. Therefore, this has generated
interest in finding more reliable alternatives, such as millimeter-wave
(mmWave) radar. Recent research on mmWave radar object detection has
predominantly focused on 2D detection of road users. Although these systems
demonstrate excellent performance for 2D problems, they lack the sensing
capability to measure elevation, which is essential for 3D drone detection. To
address this gap, we propose CubeDN, a single-stage end-to-end radar object
detection network specifically designed for flying drones. CubeDN overcomes
challenges such as poor elevation resolution by utilizing a dual radar
configuration and a novel deep learning pipeline. It simultaneously detects,
localizes, and classifies drones of two sizes, achieving decimeter-level
tracking accuracy at closer ranges with overall $95\%$ average precision (AP)
and $85\%$ average recall (AR). Furthermore, CubeDN completes data processing
and inference at 10Hz, making it highly suitable for practical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出任务/指令依赖的affordance概念，构建了包含1.5万个物体-指令-操作三元组的数据集，并开发了基于大语言模型的"搜索验证"推理流程来预测affordance。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有affordance研究大多忽视了任务/指令依赖性，即同一物体在不同指令下会产生不同的操作区域和方向。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 构建了从自我中心视角的物体-指令-操作数据集，采用"搜索验证"管道让大语言模型逐步预测affordance，并在迭代过程中进行自我验证。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅解锁了指令导向的affordance预测能力，而且在广泛任务上取得了优异性能。

Conclusion: 任务/指令依赖的affordance概念对于智能机器人物体操作至关重要，所提出的方法有效解决了这一挑战。

Abstract: Affordance is crucial for intelligent robots in the context of object
manipulation. In this paper, we argue that affordance should be
task-/instruction-dependent, which is overlooked by many previous works. That
is, different instructions can lead to different manipulation regions and
directions even for the same object. According to this observation, we present
a new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance
triplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed
to approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we
investigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance
predictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is
asked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being
verified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process.
Experiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented
affordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance
broadly.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires a seamless integration of
perception and decision making under uncertain conditions. Although computer
vision (CV) models such as YOLO achieve high accuracy in detecting traffic
signs and obstacles, their performance degrades in drift scenarios caused by
weather variations or unseen objects. This work presents a simulated autonomous
driving system that combines a context aware CV model with adaptive control
using the ADORE framework. The CARLA simulator was integrated with ADORE via
the ROS bridge, allowing real-time communication between perception, decision,
and control modules. A simulated test case was designed in both clear and drift
weather conditions to demonstrate the robust detection performance of the
perception model while ADORE successfully adapted vehicle behavior to speed
limits and obstacles with low response latency. The findings highlight the

*Karel Bartunek,Lukas Rustler,Matej Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在完全无视觉输入的情况下，仅依靠触觉反馈来搜索和抓取物体的方法，利用机器人全身表面的接触感知能力，显著提高了搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人定位和抓取物体主要依赖视觉传感器，触觉反馈通常只是辅助作用。本研究探索在完全无视觉输入的情况下，仅通过触觉反馈来搜索和抓取物体的可能性，特别是在视觉感知具有挑战性的环境中。

Method: 将搜索分为两个阶段：(1) 使用覆盖敏感皮肤的完整机器人表面进行粗略的工作空间探索；(2) 使用配备力/力矩传感器的末端执行器进行精确定位。该方法不限于特定设置，可部署在任何具有全身接触感知能力的平台上。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人上系统评估表明，该方法能够定位、抓取和放置多种物体。真实机器人对单个物体的总体成功率为85.7%，失败主要发生在抓取特定物体时。使用全身接触的方法比仅使用末端执行器触觉反馈的基线方法快6倍。

Conclusion: 这种基于全身触觉感知的方法在视觉感知具有挑战性的环境中（如农业中需要在树叶中定位和采摘水果蔬菜）具有广阔的应用前景，能够有效提高搜索效率并实现物体的成功抓取。

Abstract: Locating and grasping of objects by robots is typically performed using
visual sensors. Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only
secondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of
searching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying
on haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the
complete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search
is divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete
robot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector
equipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in
simulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be
located, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real
robot for one object was 85.7\% with failures mainly while grasping specific
objects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a
baseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show
locating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not
restricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the
ability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface. This work holds
promise for diverse applications in areas with challenging visual perception
(due to lighting, dust, smoke, occlusion) such as in agriculture when fruits or
vegetables need to be located inside foliage and picked.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维非线性人体肌肉骨骼模型的控制挑战，现有方法多为单一技能专家，需要开发能够处理多任务、多体现的通用策略。

Method: 结合行为克隆和PPO微调，使用创新的感觉运动词汇表（sensorimotor vocabulary）和transformer架构处理可变观测和动作空间。

Result: 在14个挑战性控制任务中达到专家或超专家级性能，支持高效多任务多体现学习，并能快速适应新任务。

Conclusion: Arnold框架为生物运动控制提供新见解，验证了肌肉协同作用在任务间有限的可迁移性，推动了通用运动控制策略的发展。

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the
human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning
breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like
reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with
many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists",
achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold,
a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold
combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or
super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object
manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor
vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous
sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary
via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action
spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task,
multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.
Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control,
corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle
synergies across tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动机器人遥操中的通信延迟影响人机协作，但之前没有研究深入探讨延迟对人类操作性能和神经认知的影响机制。

Method: 进行人在环节实验，整10名参与者，统合大脑电图(EEG)和机器行为数据，在不同延迟条件下(0-500ms，每次100ms递增)系统分析性能和神经生理指标。

Result: 行为分析显示200-300ms延迟导致性能显著下降；EEG分析发现前颖叶颖带电力和顶叶颖带电力与延迟显著相关；识别出100-200ms的早期延迟感知阈值窗口；当延迟超过400ms时所有特征达到生理极限饼和。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了首次证据证明人类在遥操任务中的感知和认知延迟阈值，为设计延迟补偿策略提供了关键的神经认知视角。

Abstract: Communication delays in mobile robot teleoperation adversely affect
human-machine collaboration. Understanding delay effects on human operational
performance and neurocognition is essential for resolving this issue. However,
no previous research has explored this. To fill this gap, we conduct a
human-in-the-loop experiment involving 10 participants, integrating
electroencephalography (EEG) and robot behavior data under varying delays
(0-500 ms in 100 ms increments) to systematically investigate these effects.
Behavior analysis reveals significant performance degradation at 200-300 ms
delays, affecting both task efficiency and accuracy. EEG analysis discovers
features with significant delay dependence: frontal $\theta/\beta$-band and
parietal $\alpha$-band power. We also identify a threshold window (100-200 ms)
for early perception of delay in humans, during which these EEG features first
exhibit significant differences. When delay exceeds 400 ms, all features
plateau, indicating saturation of cognitive resource allocation at
physiological limits. These findings provide the first evidence of perceptual
and cognitive delay thresholds during teleoperation tasks in humans, offering
critical neurocognitive insights for the design of delay compensation
strategies.

Motivation: 研究推力辅助双足机器人的混合腿-推进器运动基本原理，理解不同运动模式下腿部和推进器的协同工作机制。

Method: 分析Harpy机器人在小跑和跳跃实验中的数据集，通过多运动模式数据分析来研究混合驱动方法的稳定性和控制策略。

Result: 机器人实现了有界轨迹稳定运动、低扭矩关节控制、精确足部放置，推进器在悬空阶段提供额外控制，腿部提供主要推进力，实验显示良好的重复性和对称性。

Conclusion: 混合腿-推进器驱动方法具有鲁棒性，需要针对不同运动阶段（特别是悬空阶段）制定特定的控制策略，腿部与推进器的战略协同是实现稳定混合运动的关键。

Abstract: This study presents an analysis of experimental data from Harpy, a
thruster-assisted bipedal robot developed at Northeastern University. The study
examines data sets from trotting and jumping experiments to understand the
fundamental principles governing hybrid leg-thruster locomotion. Through data
analysis across multiple locomotion modes, this research reveals that Harpy
achieves stable locomotion with bounded trajectories and consistent foot
placement through strategic leg-thruster synergy. The results demonstrate
controlled joint behavior with low torques and symmetric tracking, accurate
foot placement within kinematic constraints despite phase-transition
perturbations, and underactuated degree-of-freedom stability without
divergence. Energy level analysis reveals that legs provide primary propulsion,
while the thrusters enable additional aerial phase control. The analysis
identifies critical body-leg coupling dynamics during aerial phases that
require phase-specific control strategies. Consistent repeatability and
symmetry across experiments validate the robustness of the hybrid actuation
approach.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将离散和连续决策空间的共识视为不同问题，需要统一的解决方案

Method: 通过将群体表示为因子图，使用纯对等消息传递的高斯置信传播算法

Result: 在形状形成和离散决策两个应用中展示了方法的可扩展性和效率

Conclusion: 该方法为需要分布式共识的多机器人系统提供了一个有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Robot swarms require cohesive collective behaviour to address diverse
challenges, including shape formation and decision-making. Existing approaches
often treat consensus in discrete and continuous decision spaces as distinct
problems. We present DANCeRS, a unified, distributed algorithm leveraging
Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to achieve consensus in both domains. By
representing a swarm as a factor graph our method ensures scalability and
robustness in dynamic environments, relying on purely peer-to-peer message
passing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general framework through two
applications where agents in a swarm must achieve consensus on global behaviour
whilst relying on local communication. In the first, robots must perform path
planning and collision avoidance to create shape formations. In the second, we
show how the same framework can be used by a group of robots to form a
consensus over a set of discrete decisions. Experimental results highlight our
method's scalability and efficiency compared to recent approaches to these
problems making it a promising solution for multi-robot systems requiring
distributed consensus. We encourage the reader to see the supplementary video
demo.

<details>

Motivation: 现有自监督方法难以捕捉不可通行区域特征，且大多仅使用单一模态，忽略了多模态融合的优势

Method: 整合足迹、LiDAR和相机数据作为视觉基础模型提示，生成可通行性标签；训练双流网络分别学习不同模态；加入稀疏LiDAR监督减少伪标签噪声

Result: 在城市场景、越野环境和校园环境中验证有效性，自动标注方法在多样化数据集上达到约88% IoU，多模态可通行性估计网络在所有评估数据集上IoU提升1.6-3.5%

Conclusion: 提出的多模态自监督框架能有效整合异构传感器优势，生成高质量可通行性标签，显著提升机器人导航中的地形感知能力

Abstract: Traversability estimation is critical for enabling robots to navigate across
diverse terrains and environments. While recent self-supervised learning
methods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the
characteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works
concentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths
offered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust
traversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a
multimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and
estimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and
camera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability
labels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging
these labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different
modalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse
traversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based
supervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,
extensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling
method consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared
to existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal
traversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by
1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets.

TL;DR: SafeBimanual是一个测试时轨迹优化框架，为预训练的基于扩散模型的双臂操作策略添加安全约束，避免危险行为并提高成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的双臂操作策略忽略了物理安全约束，导致可能损坏机器人和物体的危险行为

Method: 设计不同双臂协作模式的安全约束成本函数，通过扩散去噪过程的引导采样优化轨迹，使用视觉语言模型动态调度成本函数

Result: 在模拟任务中成功率提高13.7%，不安全交互减少18.8%；在真实世界任务中成功率提高32.5%

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升双臂操作的安全性和成功率，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and
manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination
requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved
promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual
manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual
manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and
objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework
named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation
policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid
dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design
diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation
patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and
objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of
diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)
to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding
pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically
generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual
demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase
in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world
tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by
32.5%.

TL;DR: FlowVLA通过引入视觉思维链(Visual CoT)框架，在预测未来帧之前先推理场景运动动态，使用光流表示来解耦静态外观和动态运动，显著提升了视觉预测质量和策略学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型通过下一帧预测训练内部世界模型，但这种方法将静态外观与动态运动纠缠在一起，导致不合理的视觉预测和低效的策略学习。

Method: 提出Visual CoT框架，在FlowVLA中实现"当前帧→光流→下一帧"的推理过程，通过单一自回归Transformer生成中间光流表示来编码运动动态。

Result: 在机器人操作基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了样本效率，产生了更连贯的视觉预测。

Conclusion: 该方法为世界建模提供了更原则性的基础，通过解耦动态学习改善了视觉预测和策略学习效果。

Abstract: Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on an internal world model
trained via next-frame prediction. This approach, however, struggles with
physical reasoning as it entangles static appearance with dynamic motion, often
resulting in implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To
address these limitations, we introduce the Visual Chain of Thought (Visual
CoT): a pre-training framework that encourages a model to reason about how a
scene evolves before predicting what it will look like. We instantiate this
principle in FlowVLA, which predicts a future frame ($v_{t+1}$) only after
generating an intermediate optical flow representation ($f_t$) that encodes
motion dynamics. This ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'' reasoning
process is implemented within a single autoregressive Transformer, guiding the
model to learn disentangled dynamics. As a result, FlowVLA produces coherent
visual predictions and facilitates more efficient policy learning. Experiments
on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a
more principled foundation for world modeling. Project page:

TL;DR: TaDiCodec是一种新型语音编码器，使用扩散自编码器和文本引导的扩散解码器，实现6.25Hz极低帧率和0.0875kbps比特率，在语音生成评估指标上表现优异，且采用单阶段端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前语音分词器存在的三个主要问题：依赖多层残差向量量化结构或高帧率、需要预训练模型进行语义蒸馏、以及复杂的两阶段训练过程。

Method: 采用端到端优化的扩散自编码器进行量化和重建，在扩散解码器中集成文本引导以提升重建质量和实现最优压缩，使用单层码本。

Result: 在24kHz语音上实现6.25Hz帧率和0.0875kbps比特率，在WER、说话人相似度和语音质量等关键指标上表现优异，验证了在零样本文本到语音任务中的兼容性。

Conclusion: TaDiCodec提供了一种高效的单阶段端到端训练方案，无需辅助预训练模型，显著减小了重建-生成差距，适用于语音语言建模任务。

Abstract: Speech tokenizers serve as foundational components for speech language
models, yet current designs exhibit several limitations, including: 1)
dependence on multi-layer residual vector quantization structures or high frame
rates, 2) reliance on auxiliary pre-trained models for semantic distillation,
and 3) requirements for complex two-stage training processes. In this work, we
introduce the Text-aware Diffusion Transformer Speech Codec (TaDiCodec), a
novel approach designed to overcome these challenges. TaDiCodec employs
end-to-end optimization for quantization and reconstruction through a diffusion
autoencoder, while integrating text guidance into the diffusion decoder to
enhance reconstruction quality and achieve optimal compression. TaDiCodec
achieves an extremely low frame rate of 6.25 Hz and a corresponding bitrate of
0.0875 kbps with a single-layer codebook for 24 kHz speech, while maintaining
superior performance on critical speech generation evaluation metrics such as
Word Error Rate (WER), speaker similarity (SIM), and speech quality (UTMOS).
Notably, TaDiCodec employs a single-stage, end-to-end training paradigm, and
obviating the need for auxiliary pre-trained models. We also validate the
compatibility of TaDiCodec in language model based zero-shot text-to-speech
with both autoregressive modeling and masked generative modeling, demonstrating
its effectiveness and efficiency for speech language modeling, as well as a
significantly small reconstruction-generation gap. We will open source our code
and model checkpoints. Audio samples are are available at
https:/tadicodec.github.io/. We release code and model checkpoints at

Abstract: The WildSpoof Challenge aims to advance the use of in-the-wild data in two

Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis for generating spoofed speech, and (2)
Spoofing-robust Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV) for detecting spoofed

protocols, participants treat them as separate and independent tasks. The
primary objectives of the challenge are: (i) to promote the use of in-the-wild
data for both TTS and SASV, moving beyond conventional clean and controlled
datasets and considering real-world scenarios; and (ii) to encourage
interdisciplinary collaboration between the spoofing generation (TTS) and
spoofing detection (SASV) communities, thereby fostering the development of
more integrated, robust, and realistic systems.

Conclusion: 该方法能够高质量地完成文本条件语音插入任务，保持语音的连贯性和语音特征，为语音编辑和更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a method for the task of text-conditioned speech insertion, i.e.
inserting a speech sample in an input speech sample, conditioned on the
corresponding complete text transcript. An example use case of the task would
be to update the speech audio when corrections are done on the corresponding
text transcript. The proposed method follows a transformer-based
non-autoregressive approach that allows speech insertions of variable lengths,
which are dynamically determined during inference, based on the text transcript
and tempo of the available partial input. It is capable of maintaining the
speaker's voice characteristics, prosody and other spectral properties of the
available speech input. Results from our experiments and user study on LibriTTS
show that our method outperforms baselines based on an existing adaptive text
to speech method. We also provide numerous qualitative results to appreciate
the quality of the output from the proposed method.

Motivation: 机器声音在频率和时间域上存在一致且重复的模式，这些模式在不同尺度的机器类型间差异显著，但现有研究对跨尺度模式变化的探索不足

Method: 设计多尺度扫描网络(MSN)，使用不同大小的卷积核对音频频谱图进行扫描，结合轻量级卷积网络和权重共享实现高效可扩展的特征表示

Result: 在DCASE 2020和DCASE 2023 Task 2数据集上的实验表明，MSN达到了最先进的性能水平

Conclusion: MSN通过有效捕捉多尺度模式，显著提升了异常声音检测系统的性能

Abstract: Machine sounds exhibit consistent and repetitive patterns in both the
frequency and time domains, which vary significantly across scales for
different machine types. For instance, rotating machines often show periodic
features in short time intervals, while reciprocating machines exhibit broader
patterns spanning the time domain. While prior studies have leveraged these
patterns to improve Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD), the variation of patterns
across scales remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we
introduce a Multi-scale Scanning Network (MSN) designed to capture patterns at
multiple scales. MSN employs kernel boxes of varying sizes to scan audio
spectrograms and integrates a lightweight convolutional network with shared
weights for efficient and scalable feature representation. Experimental
evaluations on the DCASE 2020 and DCASE 2023 Task 2 datasets demonstrate that
MSN achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
advancing ASD systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式语音修复模型训练目标与人类感知偏好存在偏差，导致音质不理想。虽然后训练对齐在其他生成领域有效，但在语音修复领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出多指标偏好对齐策略，构建GenSR-Pref数据集（8万对偏好数据），每对数据基于涵盖感知质量、信号保真度、内容一致性和音色保持的多个指标进行选择。应用直接偏好优化（DPO）方法在自回归模型、掩码生成模型和流匹配模型上进行对齐训练。

Result: 在多种语音修复基准测试中，客观和主观评估均显示一致的显著性能提升。消融研究证实多指标策略优于单指标方法，能有效避免奖励作弊。对齐后的模型还能作为高质量数据标注器，在数据稀缺场景下为判别式模型生成伪标签。

Conclusion: 多指标偏好对齐策略能有效提升生成式语音修复模型的性能，解决训练目标与人类感知偏好的不一致问题，同时为数据稀缺场景提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent generative models have significantly advanced speech restoration
tasks, yet their training objectives often misalign with human perceptual
preferences, resulting in suboptimal quality. While post-training alignment has
proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation,
its application to generative speech restoration remains largely
under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying
preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust
preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To
address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment
strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference
pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite
of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency,
and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference
signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we
observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse
generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models
(MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both
objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority
of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward
hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as
powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as
a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce
scenarios like singing voice restoration. Demo

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合体传导麦克风信号(BMS)和声学麦克风信号(AMS)的多模态框架，通过映射网络增强BMS和掩码网络降噪AMS，动态融合机制适应不同噪声环境，在TAPS数据集上验证了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体传导麦克风信号(BMS)具有强抗噪性但会丢失高频信息，需要补充模态来补偿这一缺陷，实现既抗噪又保持高频完整性的语音处理。

Method: 使用两个专门网络：基于映射的模型增强BMS，基于掩码的模型降噪AMS；通过动态融合机制根据局部噪声条件自适应整合两种模态的优势。

Result: 在TAPS数据集（使用DNS-2023噪声片段增强）上的客观语音质量评估显示，该方法在多种噪声环境下均优于单模态解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态框架成功结合了BMS的抗噪优势和AMS的高频信息，动态融合机制确保了在不同噪声条件下都能充分利用各模态优势，实现了噪声抑制和高频重建的双重目标。

Abstract: Body\-conduction microphone signals (BMS) bypass airborne sound, providing
strong noise resistance. However, a complementary modality is required to
compensate for the inherent loss of high\-frequency information. In this study,
we propose a novel multi\-modal framework that combines BMS and acoustic
microphone signals (AMS) to achieve both noise suppression and high\-frequency
reconstruction. Unlike conventional multi\-modal approaches that simply merge
features, our method employs two specialized networks\: a mapping-based model
to enhance BMS and a masking-based model to denoise AMS. These networks are
integrated through a dynamic fusion mechanism that adapts to local noise
conditions, ensuring the optimal use of each modality's strengths. We performed
evaluations on the TAPS dataset, augmented with DNS\-2023 noise clips, using
objective speech quality metrics. The results clearly demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single\-modal solutions in a wide range of noisy
environments.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: ClearMask和LiveMask是两种无噪声的语音深度伪造防御机制，通过选择性频率过滤、音频风格转换和优化混响来保护语音，无需注入噪声即可有效防止语音合成模型的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音深度伪造防御方法通常通过注入噪声来破坏语音编码器，但会降低音频质量且需要预先了解攻击方法，在实时音频场景中效果有限。需要一种无噪声、无需先验知识的通用防御方案。

Method: ClearMask通过选择性过滤mel-spectrogram特定频率来诱导可转移的语音特征损失，应用音频风格转换欺骗语音解码器，并引入优化混响来干扰语音生成模型输出。LiveMask则通过通用频率滤波器和混响生成器实时保护流式语音。

Result: 实验表明ClearMask和LiveMask能有效防止语音深度伪造攻击欺骗说话人验证模型和人类听众，即使面对未见过的语音合成模型和黑盒API服务。ClearMask还对试图从受保护样本恢复原始音频的自适应攻击具有韧性。

Conclusion: 提出的无噪声防御机制在保持语音自然性的同时，提供了对语音深度伪造攻击的有效保护，适用于实时和离线场景，具有很好的泛化能力和抗攻击韧性。

Abstract: Voice deepfake attacks, which artificially impersonate human speech for
malicious purposes, have emerged as a severe threat. Existing defenses
typically inject noise into human speech to compromise voice encoders in speech
synthesis models. However, these methods degrade audio quality and require
prior knowledge of the attack approaches, limiting their effectiveness in
diverse scenarios. Moreover, real-time audios, such as speech in virtual
meetings and voice messages, are still exposed to voice deepfake threats. To
overcome these limitations, we propose ClearMask, a noise-free defense
mechanism against voice deepfake attacks. Unlike traditional approaches,
ClearMask modifies the audio mel-spectrogram by selectively filtering certain
frequencies, inducing a transferable voice feature loss without injecting
noise. We then apply audio style transfer to further deceive voice decoders
while preserving perceived sound quality. Finally, optimized reverberation is
introduced to disrupt the output of voice generation models without affecting
the naturalness of the speech. Additionally, we develop LiveMask to protect
streaming speech in real-time through a universal frequency filter and
reverberation generator. Our experimental results show that ClearMask and
LiveMask effectively prevent voice deepfake attacks from deceiving speaker
verification models and human listeners, even for unseen voice synthesis models
and black-box API services. Furthermore, ClearMask demonstrates resilience
against adaptive attackers who attempt to recover the original audio signal
from the protected speech samples.

*Takuhiro Kaneko,Hirokazu Kameoka,Kou Tanaka,Yuto Kondo*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: FasterVoiceGrad是一个基于扩散模型的语音转换系统，通过同时蒸馏扩散模型和内容编码器，实现了比FastVoiceGrad更快的转换速度，在GPU上快6.6-6.9倍，CPU上快1.8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VoiceGrad模型虽然语音质量和说话人相似度高，但迭代采样过程缓慢。FastVoiceGrad通过蒸馏解决了采样速度问题，但内容编码器计算量大，仍然影响转换速度。

Method: 提出FasterVoiceGrad，使用对抗扩散转换蒸馏（ADCD）方法同时蒸馏扩散模型和内容编码器，在转换过程中进行蒸馏，利用对抗训练和分数蒸馏训练。

Result: 实验评估显示，FasterVoiceGrad在one-shot语音转换中与FastVoiceGrad性能相当，但在GPU上速度快6.6-6.9倍，CPU上快1.8倍。

Conclusion: FasterVoiceGrad成功解决了基于扩散模型的语音转换系统的速度瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了转换效率。

Abstract: A diffusion-based voice conversion (VC) model (e.g., VoiceGrad) can achieve
high speech quality and speaker similarity; however, its conversion process is
slow owing to iterative sampling. FastVoiceGrad overcomes this limitation by
distilling VoiceGrad into a one-step diffusion model. However, it still
requires a computationally intensive content encoder to disentangle the
speaker's identity and content, which slows conversion. Therefore, we propose
FasterVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based VC model obtained by
simultaneously distilling a diffusion model and content encoder using
adversarial diffusion conversion distillation (ADCD), where distillation is
performed in the conversion process while leveraging adversarial and score
distillation training. Experimental evaluations of one-shot VC demonstrated
that FasterVoiceGrad achieves competitive VC performance compared to
FastVoiceGrad, with 6.6-6.9 and 1.8 times faster speed on a GPU and CPU,
respectively.

TL;DR: 通过使用预训练冻结的语音编码器特征提取器，提出了一种高效的语音转换对抗训练方法，在保持性能的同时大幅减少训练时间和内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统语音合成和语音转换中使用波形进行对抗训练导致的时间和内學开销过大的问题。

Method: 提出VPFD（vocoder-projected feature discriminator）方法，利用预训练冻结的语音编码器特征提取器进行对抗训练，只需单次上采样。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在潜在渐变语音转换中达到了与波形辨别器相似的性能，同时训练时间减少了9.6倍，内存消耗减少11.4倍。

Conclusion: VPFD方法提供了一种高效的对抗训练方案，在保持语音转换质量的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: In text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), acoustic features, such as
mel spectrograms, are typically used as synthesis or conversion targets owing
to their compactness and ease of learning. However, because the ultimate goal
is to generate high-quality waveforms, employing a vocoder to convert these
features into waveforms and applying adversarial training in the time domain is
reasonable. Nevertheless, upsampling the waveform introduces significant time
and memory overheads. To address this issue, we propose a vocoder-projected
feature discriminator (VPFD), which uses vocoder features for adversarial
training. Experiments on diffusion-based VC distillation demonstrated that a
pretrained and frozen vocoder feature extractor with a single upsampling step
is necessary and sufficient to achieve a VC performance comparable to that of
waveform discriminators while reducing the training time and memory consumption
by 9.6 and 11.4 times, respectively.

Abstract: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents. Previous
suicide risk prediction studies have primarily focused on either textual or
acoustic information in isolation, the integration of multimodal signals, such
as speech and text, offers a more comprehensive understanding of an
individual's mental state. Motivated by this, and in the context of the 1st
SpeechWellness detection challenge, we explore a lightweight multi-branch
multimodal system based on a dynamic fusion mechanism for speechwellness
detection. To address the limitation of prior approaches that rely on
time-domain waveforms for acoustic analysis, our system incorporates both
time-domain and time-frequency (TF) domain acoustic features, as well as
semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a dynamic fusion block to
adaptively integrate information from different modalities. Specifically, it
applies learnable weights to each modality during the fusion process, enabling
the model to adjust the contribution of each modality. To enhance computational
efficiency, we design a lightweight structure by simplifying the original
baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system
exhibits superior performance compared to the challenge baseline, achieving a
78% reduction in model parameters and a 5% improvement in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在自动言语障碍检测方面取得进展，但在临床应用中，可解释性和透明度至关重要，基于规则的方法仍然不可或缺。

Method: 提出增强型基于规则框架，包含说话速率归一化、多级声学特征分析和分层决策结构，整合了UCLASS、FluencyBank和SEP-28k等多个语料库的见解。

Result: 在延长音检测方面达到97-99%的高准确率，在不同说话速率下保持稳定性能，可解释模型可与现代机器学习管道集成。

Conclusion: 虽然神经方法在无约束设置下可能获得略高的准确率，但基于规则的方法在临床环境中具有独特优势，特别是在决策可审计性、患者特定调优和实时反馈方面。

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting
communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have
pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based
approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and
transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple
corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced
rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level
acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach
achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete
interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based
systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and
provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show
how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning
pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap
between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our
analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher
accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages
in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and
real-time feedback are essential.

Motivation: 理解影响学生数学表现的因素对设计有效教育政策至关重要，需要通过可解释的AI技术来预测成绩并识别关键预测因子

Method: 使用PISA 2018数据（67,329名学生，10个国家），采用多元线性回归、随机森林、CATBoost和人工神经网络四种模型，使用学生、家庭和学校变量，训练70%数据（五折交叉验证）测试30%数据，通过特征重要性、SHAP值和决策树可视化确保可解释性

Result: 非线性模型（特别是随机森林和神经网络）表现超过线性回归模型，随机森林在准确性和普适性方面取得最佳平衡。关键预测因子包括社会经济地位、学习时间、教师动机和学生对数学的态度，但影响程度在不同国家存在差异

Conclusion: 研究证明了学习成绩的非线性和上下文依赖性，强调了可解释AI在教育研究中的价值，为发现跨国模式、推动公平教育改革和支持个性化学习策略提供了重要依据

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is
vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to
predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries
(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using
student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data
(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.
Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure
interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree
visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,
with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes
toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual
diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and
CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the
non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in
educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs
equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning
strategies.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在ICD编码方面虽然准确率提升，但缺乏可解释性，影响临床信任。现有方法主要依赖注意力机制和定性评估，缺乏系统性评估标准和专门的合理化解释生成方法。

Method: 1) 从忠实度(反映模型真实推理)和合理性(与专家判断一致性)两个维度评估解释质量；2) 构建新的高质量标注数据集；3) 提出基于LLM生成合理化解释的学习方法，使用带/不带标注示例的LLM提示生成远程监督信号。

Result: LLM生成的合理化解释与人类专家判断最为接近。加入少量人工标注示例不仅能进一步改进合理化解释生成，还能提升基于合理化解释的学习方法效果。

Conclusion: 通过系统性评估框架和新数据集，证明了LLM在生成临床合理化解释方面的潜力，为提升ICD编码模型的可解释性和临床可信度提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have
significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of
explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust
and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on
attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack
systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale
datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate
rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding
through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations
reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how
consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the
evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,
offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with
current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of
rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of
LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale
learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where
rationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used
as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated
rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,
incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves
rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.

Method: 提出计算多智能体社会实验框架，结合生成式智能体建模和虚拟民族志方法，通过三个研究分析群体立场分化和社会边界形成的机制。

Result: 智能体表现出独立于预设身份的内生立场，对不同话语策略有独特语调偏好和响应模式，能够通过语言互动主动解构现有身份权力结构并重建自组织社区边界。

Conclusion: 预设身份不会刚性决定智能体的社会结构，人类研究者需要关注智能体语言网络中的内生机制和互动动力学，这为使用生成式AI建模群体社会动力学和人机协作研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group
social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description
language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement
learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning
environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games,
PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its

popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this
paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games
designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators
since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an
expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the
performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show
that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive
to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination
of control, planning, and high-level insight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床工作流存在分散性问题，多个脚本和任务特定网络导致效率低下、运营成本高，缺乏数据驱动的模型识别和标准化输出交付。

Method: 提出两种解决方案：1）VLM作为模型卡片匹配器，通过三阶段工作流路由图像到适当专业模型；2）在专业特定数据集上微调VLM，使单一模型覆盖多个下游任务。包含阶段性提示和答案选择器机制保障准确性。

Result: 在消化内科、血液学、眼科学和病理学等多个医学专业领域，单一模型部署的性能达到或接近专门化基线模型的水平。

Conclusion: 这种方法证明一个VLM既能决策又能执行，可以减少数据科学家的工作量、简化监控、提高模型选择透明度并降低集成复杂度。

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific
networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These
pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency
and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model
identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model
outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that
uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First
(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an
incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow
(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)
stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a
stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each
stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow
with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on
specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream
tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying
deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,
our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach
shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data
scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection
(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

Motivation: 现有LLM系统要么局限于狭窄任务范围，要么受限于有限的创造能力，需要开发能够自主产生创造性科学概念的系统。

Method: 系统由两部分组成：(1) Nuri灵感引擎从18万篇生物学论文构建的关键词图中提取新颖关键词集；(2) 显化管道通过链接关键词、分析逻辑结构、验证合理性，最终起草原创科学概念。

Result: Nuri的评估指标AUROC得分0.737准确分类高影响力论文；显化管道成功从关键词集重建顶级期刊文章核心概念（85%以上重建可靠）；Spacer输出与领先出版物相似度显著高于SOTA LLM。

Conclusion: Spacer系统通过去语境化方法有效实现了自动化科学发现，能够生成具有创造性和事实基础的科学概念，在科学创新方面超越了现有LLM的能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next
frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems
are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities
of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops
creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer
attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that
disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity
from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an
inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline
that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts
novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000
academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds
links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their
plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to
our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies
high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline
also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal
articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates
that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our
embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more
similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架，将奉承行为定义为当呈现用户观点时与理性行为的偏差。研究3个不同任务、开源和闭源LLM组合，以及两种奉承探测方法，并使用多种方法从LLM中提取概率判断。

Result: 研究发现：1）LLM不具备贝叶斯理性；2）探测奉承会导致预测后验概率显著偏向引导结果；3）奉承有时会增加贝叶斯误差，少数情况下反而减少误差；4）奉承引起的贝叶斯误差变化与Brier分数相关性不强。

Conclusion: 仅研究奉承对真实标签的影响不能完全捕捉由奉承引起的推理错误，贝叶斯框架提供了更全面的奉承行为量化方法，适用于具有固有不确定性或无真实标签的任务。

Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue
in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context
of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by
measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric
characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in
scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian
framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when
presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and
irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In
comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive
behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not
have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination
of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing
sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability
judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause
deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian
error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)
probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted
posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in
increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases
error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly
correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on
ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to
sycophancy.

Abstract: Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative
analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation
and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such
as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,
they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their
conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world
trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards
evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning
process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify
model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to
obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,
questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a
method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves
attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced
attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an
average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth
responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more
interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify
and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

Motivation: 无限论证框架虽然表达能力强，但计算不可行性限制了其实际应用。研究旨在探索有穷性无限论证框架的计算复杂性，寻找表达能力和计算可行性之间的平衡。

Method: 通过理论分析研究无限但有穷性论证框架的计算复杂性，特别关注基于可接受性语义的推理问题，识别导致复杂度降低的组合约束条件。

Result: 发现虽然有穷性假设本身不保证复杂度降低，但对于基于可接受性的语义，存在显著的组合约束使得计算复杂度大幅下降。

Conclusion: 有穷性无限论证框架为许多推理形式提供了自然设置，在表达能力和计算可行性之间达到了良好平衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide a formal setting to analyze
many forms of reasoning with conflicting information. While the expressiveness
of general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of
reasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs
limit their use, even in many theoretical applications.
  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite
but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each
argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a
surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary
does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the
admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint
which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs
provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals
of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being
computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be
useful.

TL;DR: 提出Generate-and-Split (GaS)框架，结合强化学习和最优分割算法解决Min-Max多旅行商问题，显著提升解质量和可迁移性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两阶段方法将学习组件与经典求解器分离，破坏了优化一致性，可能导致解质量下降。需要一种能够联合优化的新框架

Method: Generate-and-Split (GaS)框架：使用强化学习生成路径，结合最优分割算法进行路径分割，采用LSTM增强模型处理部分可观测性

Result: 在大量实验中，GaS框架在解质量和可迁移性方面显著优于现有的基于学习的方法

Conclusion: 提出的联合训练框架成功解决了传统两阶段方法的优化不一致问题，为Min-Max多旅行商问题提供了高效的近似解决方案

Abstract: This study addresses the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem
($m^3$-TSP), which aims to coordinate tours for multiple salesmen such that the
length of the longest tour is minimized. Due to its NP-hard nature, exact
solvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \ne NP$. As a result,
learning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly
generate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods
combine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the
learning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent
optimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage framework named \textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),
which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting
algorithm in a joint training process. The splitting algorithm offers
near-linear scalability with respect to the number of cities and guarantees
optimal splitting in Euclidean space for any given path. To facilitate the
joint optimization of the RL component with the algorithm, we adopt an
LSTM-enhanced model architecture to address partial observability. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed GaS framework significantly outperforms
existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and
transferability.

Motivation: 随着电气化和脱碳进程加速，配电电网运营规划日益复杂，需要先进计算分析来确保电网可靠性。但现有分析方法依赖专家知识且难以自动化，许多小型电力公司缺乏研发资源来规模化使用先进分析工具。

Method: 开发PowerChain智能AI系统，利用大语言模型函数调用功能，根据自然语言查询动态生成和执行有序的领域感知函数序列，基于专家构建的电力系统函数池和已知工作流-查询对参考集。

Conclusion: PowerChain系统成功解决了配电电网分析自动化的挑战，为缺乏大型研发团队的小型电力公司提供了规模化使用先进分析工具的能力。

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution
grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating
advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience.
State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models,
functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are
challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a
large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To
address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve
unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language
models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain
dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware
functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function
pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query
pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with
both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks
operating on real utility data.

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have
gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many
critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In
particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,
how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the
risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need
to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should
move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems
should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.
Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full
spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,
multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,
conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges
associated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value
alignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of
value alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在语义描述方面已很成功，但在深度数学和空间推理方面仍有待突破。数学曲面图提供了一个理想的测试平台，可以排除自然图像中的语义噪声干扰。

Method: 创建了MaRVL-QA基准测试，包含两个新任务：拓扑计数（识别和枚举局部极值等特征）和变换识别（识别几何变换）。通过精心筛选的函数库生成数据，并进行严格的歧义过滤。

Result: 评估显示，即使是当前最先进的多模态大语言模型也表现不佳，往往依赖表面启发式方法而非稳健的空间推理。

Conclusion: MaRVL-QA为研究社区提供了一个具有挑战性的新工具，可用于衡量进展、暴露模型局限性，并指导开发具有更深层次推理能力的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the
development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a critical task in identifying manipulated multimedia
content. In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple
modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present
ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced
receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio
and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information
to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+
lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual
input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake
content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,
which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset
allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and
realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this
dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and
processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the
"Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability," Track 2:
Audio-Visual Detection and Localization (DDL-AV), and won first place in this
competition.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work,
we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical
yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.
While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core
design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial
manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a
multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster
designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and
Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)
Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist
agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)
Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that
are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design
quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures
layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show
that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly
outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are
presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues,
\textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey
knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance
of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically
formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language
descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained
models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear
programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through
structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a
novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial
correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and
execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,
GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and
objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most
effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered
prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic
formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling
pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

Abstract: Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training
split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential
moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and
contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic
clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate
at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.
The design turns an offline policy into a continuous, clinician-supervised
system with clear controls and fast adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出MC3G框架，通过因果约束的对抗样本生成方法，在保护算法隐私的同时提供可解释且可操作的决策解释


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在高风险决策中应用日益广泛，需要透明可解释的结果，但现有解释方法可能泄露专有算法，需要在透明性和算法保护之间取得平衡

Method: 使用模型无关的方法，通过可解释的基于规则的代理模型近似黑盒模型，生成因果约束的对抗样本，仅计算用户主动改变特征所需的努力

Result: MC3G相比现有技术提供更可解释和可操作的对抗建议，同时具有更低的成本

Conclusion: MC3G有潜力增强机器学习决策过程的透明度、问责制和实际效用

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent,
interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help
understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the
underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many
practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency
with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers
actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by
showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We
propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a
novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual
methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model
using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used
to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original
underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding
the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to
causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a
favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and
actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all
while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance
transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making
processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Motivation: 解决基于机器学习的入侵检测系统黑盒问题，提高AI在网络安全等关键领域决策的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 使用LIME提供局部解释、ELI5和决策树算法提供全局解释，结合局部和全局解释方法来增强IDS决策的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为ML驱动的IDS领域带来了透明度，对在网络安全关键系统中广泛采用可解释AI具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in
critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to
a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are
being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make
the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability
becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains
like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and
autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the
reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the
explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the
blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a
framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision
making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms
to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of
IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on
a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of
significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,
this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be
highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical
systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying
attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the
feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare,
entertainment, and education, with Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) playing a crucial role. However, SEWs face inherent
limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading
computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and
server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to
train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous
and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at
fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results
show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability,
ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the
potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing,
such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型缺乏专门的元级认知系统，导致推理过程不可控、不可靠且不灵活，无法实现"思考关于思考"的人类认知能力。

Method: 基于认知科学原理，Meta-R1将推理过程分解为对象级和元级组件，在级联框架中协调主动规划、在线调节和自适应早停机制。

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试和八个竞争基线对比中，Meta-R1性能提升达27.3%，token消耗减少至15.7%~32.7%，效率提升达14.8%，且在不同数据集和模型骨干上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: Meta-R1成功为大型推理模型赋予了明确的元认知能力，解决了现有模型在可控性、可靠性和灵活性方面的根本限制，证明了元认知框架的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;
and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and
model backbones.

TL;DR: VIPER-R1是一个多模态物理定律发现模型，通过视觉感知、轨迹数据和符号推理相结合，能够从视觉现象中自动推导出物理公式，在准确性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于符号回归或大语言模型的物理定律发现方法仅限于单模态数据，忽视了丰富的视觉运动表征，这种"感官剥夺"严重削弱了理解动态现象时空模式的能力。

Method: 采用Motion Structure Induction (MSI)课程训练，通过监督微调解释运动相图，使用Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT)构建假设，然后通过Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration (RGSC)用强化学习优化公式结构。推理时主动调用外部符号回归工具进行Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2)。

Result: 实验表明VIPER-R1在准确性和可解释性方面持续优于最先进的多模态语言模型基线，能够更精确地发现物理定律。

Conclusion: VIPER-R1成功整合了视觉感知和符号推理，模拟了科学发现过程，为从多模态观测数据中发现物理定律提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real
world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic
regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual
phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to
physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to
interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To
address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual
Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic
formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic
reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via
a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning
to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a
Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration
(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During
inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a
high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic
regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final
step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the
theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce
PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that
VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy
and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws. Project

Method: 评估GPT-5、GPT-4o、GPT-o3、Gemini-2.5-Flash、DeepSeek-R1等先进LLMs在少样本提示下的性能，并与线性模型、集成方法和表格基础模型等传统ML基线进行比较

Result: LLMs在有限数据分类任务中表现强劲，但在回归任务中表现较差（连续输出空间大），聚类结果也有限（缺乏真正的上下文学习能力）

Conclusion: LLMs可作为结构化数据的通用预测引擎，在分类任务中具有明显优势，但在回归和聚类方面存在显著限制，适合商业智能和探索性分析场景

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language
processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across
modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs
can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit
fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical
function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets
for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,
DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established
machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and
tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong
performance in classification tasks under limited data availability,
establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in
regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely
because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and
clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of
genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid,
low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML
pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We
further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on
approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive
performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose
predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification
and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

Result: 实验表明CARL算法在现有基准测试中比最先进方法多解决50%的问题

Conclusion: CARL算法通过创新的标量化和子梯度优化方法，显著提高了约束随机最短路径问题的求解效率和成功率

Abstract: Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (CSSPs) model problems with
probabilistic effects, where a primary cost is minimised subject to constraints
over secondary costs, e.g., minimise time subject to monetary budget. Current
heuristic search algorithms for CSSPs solve a sequence of increasingly larger
CSSPs as linear programs until an optimal solution for the original CSSP is
found. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a
series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient
heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with
scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs
onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation
algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution
to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an
optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more
problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 奖励破解（AI利用有缺陷的奖励函数而非按意图执行任务）对AI对齐构成风险，需要研究奖励破解者的行为模式

Method: 构建包含1000多个奖励破解示例的数据集，在短任务（写诗、简单编码）上进行监督微调训练多个模型（GPT-4.1、GPT-4.1-mini、Qwen3等）

Result: 微调后的模型能泛化到新的奖励破解场景，偏好知识较少的评分者，编写自己的奖励函数来最大化奖励。GPT-4.1还泛化到无关的错位行为

Conclusion: 学习奖励破解的模型可能泛化到更有害的错位形式，但需要在更现实的任务和训练方法上进行验证

Abstract: Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions
rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward
hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to
overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study
the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand
examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as
writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to
train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on
these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new
settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward
functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the
training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of
misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,
encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These
fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models
trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or
harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn
to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though
confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

Conclusion: LLM推理能力与检索策略之间存在关键相互作用，需要根据模型能力选择合适的检索策略以最大化LLM在交通行为建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective
transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning
models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and
reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode
choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground
predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating
RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval
strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder
for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for
re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning
capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional
Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances
predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model
combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the
highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and
machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior
generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the
critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,
demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model
capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful
agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis,
financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing
systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and
access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from
trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These
data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the
quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce
TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these
limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end
data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news
sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,
trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all
signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.
Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,
style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for
similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management
model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In
addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation
pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving
the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across
five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance
over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing
LLM-based trading strategies.

Method: 使用无人机摄像机获取比赛数据构建UltimateTrack数据集，通过规则基础方法检测运动员移动启动并生成时间偏移的反事实场景，采用基于足球场地控制的空间评估指标进行分析

Conclusion: 该方法为评估团体运动中难以量化的移动启动时机提供了客观的手段，对高水平运动员的移动时机选择有更好的理解

Abstract: Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective
means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to
quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.

*Natalie Abreu,Edwin Zhang,Eran Malach,Naomi Saphra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究语言模型如何超越单个数据源的能力，提出了三种超越模式，并通过知识图谱模拟实验揭示了数据多样性对模型超越能力的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然语言模型被训练来模仿人类，但最终系统展现出的能力却超越了任何单个人的能力范围。为了理解这一现象，需要研究训练数据的哪些特性导致模型能够超越其数据源的表现。

Method: 基于前人工作提出了三种超越模式（技能去噪、技能选择、技能泛化），并引入基于知识图谱的设置，让模拟专家根据各自专业知识生成数据。

Result: 研究强调了数据多样性的多个方面有助于实现模型的超越能力，同时提供了一个受控的实验环境供未来研究使用。

Conclusion: 通过知识图谱模拟实验证实了数据多样性是模型实现超越性能力的关键因素，为理解语言模型超越人类个体能力的机制提供了新的研究框架。

Abstract: Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.

Conclusion: 该调查旨在促进研究社区对不同智能体推理框架的优势、适用场景和评估实践的理解，为相关领域的研究提供系统化的参考框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit
near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these
systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning
frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in
different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks
dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across
different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to
further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods,
tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a
comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific
discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.
We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize
different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research
community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths,
suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前Open RAN部署中仍然依赖静态控制和手动操作的问题，推动网络向更智能、自适应的方向发展

Method: 采用LLM驱动的AI代理解释自然语言意图，通过结构化对话协商策略，在时间尺度、空间域和协议层上分解复杂意图，并建立AI-RAN Factory自动化合成管道

Result: 在5G测试床上通过级联意图动态平衡竞争用户需求，展示了系统的有效性

Conclusion: AgentRAN通过自然语言协调替代刚性API，从根本上重新定义了未来6G网络如何自主解释、适应和优化行为以满足运营商目标

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable,
interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely
heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this
limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic
framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents
based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that
require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural
language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and
orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a
self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time
scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to
network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is
the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent
interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control
algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of
functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We
demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing
user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing
rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G
networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet
operator goals.

TL;DR: 通过将纯过去STL公式的监控降为追踪检查，实现了多项式时间复杂度的GPU加速早期故障检测框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监控技术需要构建双指数复杂度的自动机，限制了其实际应用性

Method: 将纯过去STL公式的监控降为追踪检查，利用GPU加速向量化追踪检查，通过遗传算法从历史数据中学习时态性质

Result: 框架在关键性能指标上实现了2-10%的净攽提升，超越了现有最优方法

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效的监控方案，通过降低计算复杂度和利用GPU并行计算大幅提升了性能

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check
whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given
formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically
requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in
the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In
this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring
of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced
to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be
performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the
trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for
interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that
employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace
data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: FairGamer是首个针对视频游戏场景中LLM偏见评估的基准测试，揭示了LLM的社会偏见会破坏游戏平衡，并发现LLM对现实和虚拟内容存在同构偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在视频游戏中有广泛应用潜力，但其可信度尚未充分探索，特别是社会偏见可能直接损害游戏平衡。

Method: 提出FairGamer基准测试，包含6个任务和新指标D_lstd，涵盖NPC服务、竞争对手交互和游戏场景生成三个关键场景，使用现实和虚构游戏内容。

Result: 实验发现：(1)决策偏见直接导致游戏平衡退化，Grok-3表现最差(D_lstd=0.431)；(2)LLM对现实和虚拟内容表现出同构的社会/文化偏见。

Conclusion: 这些发现暴露了LLM在游戏应用中的关键可靠性差距，社会偏见可能源于模型固有特性，需要进一步研究和改进。

Abstract: Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene
generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or
enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this
application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that
the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in
real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first
bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks
and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where
LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player
Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes.
FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content,
covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision
biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$
score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate
isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content,
suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics.
These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在严格逻辑约束任务中的局限性，同时避免LRM的高计算成本和慢推理速度问题

Method: 将SOFAI认知架构泛化为SOFAI-LM，通过元认知模块监控LLM性能并提供有针对性的迭代反馈和相关示例

Result: 在图着色和代码调试任务中显著提升LLM性能，在许多情况下达到或超越独立LRM的准确率，同时保持显著更低的推理时间

Conclusion: SOFAI-LM通过反馈驱动的协同方法有效平衡了LLM的速度优势和LRM的推理能力，为解决复杂约束问题提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various
reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint
enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are
specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come
with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address
these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)
cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a
slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module
actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative
feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine
its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate
that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving
capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that
match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less
time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,
we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the
LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem
domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two
contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,
and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM
enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while
maintaining significantly lower inference time.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在复杂多智能体路径规划任务中表现不佳，需要结合规划与多智能体协调能力。

Method: 提出三组件框架：LLM负责MAPF、预训练图神经网络NAR、交叉注意力机制，首次将GNN与地图信息整合来指导LLM。

Result: 仿真和真实实验表明，该方法在解决MAPF问题上显著优于现有基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: LLM-NAR框架成功整合神经算法推理器与大语言模型，为复杂多智能体规划任务提供了有效解决方案，且具有良好的模型适应性。

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have
demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of
tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has
been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF
is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To
improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,
LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for
MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained
graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the
first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs
with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior
performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both
simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

Conclusion: 个性化感知推理对下一代移动代理至关重要，PerPilot框架为解决个性化指令处理提供了有效方案

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for
assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents
typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing
ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized
instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset
covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios.
Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile
agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive,
understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies
personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two
complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based
exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles
personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves
its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of
personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical
programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent
literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve
optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review
questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,
and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted
experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in
automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.
Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:
Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the
obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation
accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural
language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations
in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate
several future research directions, including structured datasets,
domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular
multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper
contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical
programming.

uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical
significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates
these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At
the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each
responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,
validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own

TL;DR: SEAM是一个新的基准测试，通过四种领域中的语义等价文本和视觉表示来评估视觉语言模型的跨模态推理一致性，发现当前模型存在系统性模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型在不同表示形式下的推理一致性具有挑战性，因为模态比较通常受到任务差异和不对称信息的干扰。

Method: 引入SEAM基准，在四个具有标准化文本和视觉符号的领域中配对语义等价的输入，使用不同的符号系统进行跨模态比较，而非基于OCR的图像-文本配对。

Result: 在21个当代模型中观察到系统性模态不平衡：视觉性能通常落后于语言性能，尽管问题包含语义等价信息，且跨模态一致性相对较低。错误分析显示主要驱动因素是领域符号中的分词文本感知失败和导致幻觉的视觉感知失败。

Conclusion: SEAM建立了一个受控的语义等价环境，用于测量和改进模态无关的推理能力，结果对视觉变换具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

Motivation: 半结构化表格在现实应用中广泛存在，但现有方法存在信息丢失和布局理解困难的问题，需要自动化解决方案来替代人工分析。

Method: 提出分层正交树(HO-Tree)结构模型，定义基本树操作，将用户问题分解为子问题并生成操作流水线，采用前向和后向两阶段验证机制。

Conclusion: ST-Raptor框架有效解决了半结构化表格问答的挑战，通过树结构建模和操作流水线实现了准确高效的自动化问答。

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,
financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve
flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).
These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and
answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To
automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To
this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured
table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the
Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures
complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for
constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to
guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor
decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of
764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that
ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code
is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

Conclusion: 整合认知科学原理为LLM可解释性提供新视角，建议精调策略应利用分布式学习动态而非固化模块干预

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant
advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging
from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their
ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within
billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture
and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by
adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and
developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM
architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model
analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that
while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in
specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose
emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected
cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical
results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill
acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions
and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine
learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and
suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed
learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

Motivation: 理解AI模型为何会发展出与人类大脑相似的表征，以及具体哪些因素驱动这种相似性，目前仍不清楚。需要分离模型架构、训练过程和数据类型对大脑-模型相似性的独立贡献。

Method: 训练一系列自监督视觉变换器(DINOv3)，系统变化模型大小、训练量和图像类型。使用fMRI和MEG记录人脑对图像的表征，通过三种互补指标评估大脑-模型相似性：整体表征相似性、地形组织和时间动态。

Result: 所有三个因素都独立且交互地影响大脑相似性指标。最大的DINOv3模型使用最多人类中心图像训练时达到最高大脑相似性。训练过程中，模型先与感觉皮层的早期表征对齐，需要更多训练才能与晚期和前额叶表征对齐。这种发展轨迹与人类皮层的结构和功能特性相关。

Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that
resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this
brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,
training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like
representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers
(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their
representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI
and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess
the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall
representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.
We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -
independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.
In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric
images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like
representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:
models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and
only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with
considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed
by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the
representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with
the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least
myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the
interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural
networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising
framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual
world.

TL;DR: 本文提出了计算Blackwell最优策略的新算法，通过有理函数排序和符号操作，为确定性MDP提供了首个强多项式时间算法，为一般MDP提供了首次次指数时间算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MDP最优性准则（折扣和平均奖励）存在局限性：折扣最优性可能过度关注短期奖励，平均最优性需要强结构假设。Blackwell最优性虽然理论上更全面，但现有算法计算成本高或难以实现。

Method: 使用有理函数在1附近的排序方法，将最先进算法中的数值计算替换为有理函数的符号操作，从而获得与比特复杂度无关的边界。对确定性和一般MDP分别设计算法。

Result: 为确定性MDP提供了首个强多项式时间算法，为一般MDP提供了首次次指数时间算法。同时推广了多种策略迭代算法，将已知最佳上界从折扣准则扩展到Blackwell准则。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了Blackwell最优策略计算的计算复杂性问题，为MDP提供了更实用和高效的Blackwell最优性求解方案。

Abstract: Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for
modelling sequential decision-making across diverse domains, guided by
optimality criteria such as discounted and average rewards. However, these
criteria have inherent limitations: discounted optimality may overly prioritise
short-term rewards, while average optimality relies on strong structural
assumptions. Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust
and comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and
average reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms
for computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or
hard to implement.
  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an
ordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$. We adapt
state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and general MDPs, replacing
numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive
bounds independent of bit complexity. For deterministic MDPs, we give the first
strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing BO policies, and for general
MDPs we obtain the first subexponential-time algorithm. We further generalise
several policy iteration algorithms, extending the best known upper bounds from
the discounted to the Blackwell criterion.
