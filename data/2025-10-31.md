Abstract: Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformed
the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of
associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that
enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In
this summary, we present an overview of several key directions that have
emerged in the wake of 3DGS. We highlight advances enabling resource-efficient
training and rendering, the evolution toward dynamic (or four-dimensional,
4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations
underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we
examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its
extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

### [2] [HEIR: Learning Graph-Based Motion Hierarchies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26786)
*Cheng Zheng,William Koch,Baiang Li,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的分层运动建模方法，通过图学习直接从数据中学习结构化和可解释的运动关系，将全局绝对运动分解为父级继承模式和局部运动残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖手动定义或启发式层次结构，具有固定的运动基元，限制了在不同任务间的泛化能力。需要一种能够直接从数据中学习运动层次结构的通用方法。

Method: 将层次推断构建为可微分图学习问题，使用顶点表示基本运动，通过图神经网络捕获学习的父子依赖关系，构建基于图的运动层次结构。

Result: 在1D平移运动、2D旋转运动和动态3D场景变形三个示例上验证，能够重建内在运动层次结构，在动态3D高斯溅射场景上相比基线产生更真实和可解释的变形效果。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个适用于广泛运动中心任务的适应性、数据驱动的分层建模范式。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

### [3] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中对水下目标检测的有效性，开发了T-YOLOv5及其增强版T-YOLOv5 with CBAM，在动态海洋环境中显著提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决水下目标检测在动态海洋环境中的挑战，特别是在突然运动、部分遮挡和渐变运动条件下，传统YOLOv5模型的检测可靠性不足的问题。

Method: 第一阶段评估了时间增强的T-YOLOv5变体与标准YOLOv5的性能对比；第二阶段开发了集成卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)的T-YOLOv5增强版本。

Result: 测试结果显示，YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，而T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5 with CBAM分别达到0.813和0.811，在复杂目标检测中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提升了检测可靠性，而T-YOLOv5 with CBAM在挑战性场景中进一步改善了性能，但在简单场景下存在精度损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [4] [SEE4D: Pose-Free 4D Generation via Auto-Regressive Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26796)
*Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Tianxin Huang,Xiao Fu,Yuyang Zhao,Baorui Ma,Liang Pan,Wei Yin,Lingdong Kong,Wei Tsang Ooi,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D内容生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和视图条件修复来合成时空内容，避免了传统方法对相机轨迹预测的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法需要手动标注相机姿态，成本高且对野外视频不鲁棒。warp-then-inpaint方法虽无需姿态标签，但将相机运动与场景动态耦合，使建模和推理复杂化。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机渲染替代显式轨迹预测。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过去噪合成图像和修复遮挡区域。设计时空自回归推理流水线，沿虚拟相机样条生成连贯视频。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，SEE4D在定量指标和定性评估上均优于基于姿态或轨迹的基线方法，展现出更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SEE4D通过分离相机控制与场景建模，实现了从随意视频到4D世界建模的实用化进展，无需显式3D标注。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

### [5] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练期间直接让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，而不是事后选择生成的图像，从而提高了生成图像的质量、多样性和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大型未整理数据集上训练，以实现多样化的生成能力，但这与用户偏好不一致。现有的奖励模型通过事后选择生成的图像来对齐奖励，但这会损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练期间让模型直接学习多个奖励模型的条件，而不是事后处理。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量和训练速度。

Conclusion: 通过在训练期间直接学习多个奖励模型的条件，MIRO方法能够更好地对齐用户偏好，同时保持多样性和语义保真度，并提高训练效率。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [6] [OmniX: From Unified Panoramic Generation and Perception to Graphics-Ready 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26800)
*Yukun Huang,Jiwen Yu,Yanning Zhou,Jianan Wang,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniX是一个基于全景感知的统一框架，通过重用2D生成先验来创建适合物理渲染的3D场景，包括几何、纹理和PBR材质感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D提升方法主要关注外观生成，忽略了内在属性的感知，无法生成适合物理渲染的3D场景。

Method: 采用轻量级高效的跨模态适配器结构，重用2D生成先验进行全景感知、生成和补全，并构建大规模合成全景数据集。

Result: 实验证明该模型在全景视觉感知和图形就绪3D场景生成方面有效，为沉浸式物理真实虚拟世界生成开辟新可能。

Conclusion: OmniX框架成功将2D生成先验应用于图形就绪3D场景生成，实现了从外观生成到内在属性感知的进步。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文开发了针对自行车安全的自适应3D LiDAR分割方法，通过创建BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集填补了汽车到自行车领域的差距，显著提升了分割性能。

Motivation: 随着电动自行车日益普及，骑行者面临的安全风险增加，需要将汽车感知技术适配到自行车安全领域。

Method: 使用多传感器'SenseBike'研究平台开发3D LiDAR分割方法，创建包含3021个连续LiDAR扫描的BikeScenes数据集，包含29个动态和静态类别的语义标注。

Result: 在BikeScenes数据集上微调后达到63.6%的平均交并比(mIoU)，显著优于仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练的13.8%结果。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对自行车感知系统至关重要，BikeScenes数据集为自行车中心LiDAR分割研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [8] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于机器学习的STM图像修复和超分辨率方法，通过物理信息合成数据训练模型，有效恢复图像质量并减少图像采集时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STM技术中针尖退化和缓慢串行数据采集的限制，减少针尖调节频率并提高实验吞吐量

Method: 使用仅36张原始实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练先进的流匹配和扩散模型

Result: 模型能有效恢复图像，通过稀疏采样数据准确重建图像，使图像采集时间减少2-4倍

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验吞吐量，减少针尖调节频率并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流分解与聚合的免反演图像编辑框架，通过语义分解目标提示词、计算独立子流并自适应聚合，解决了现有方法在图像编辑中的反演不准确和梯度纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整流流模型在图像生成中表现出色，但在图像编辑任务中存在关键限制：反演过程不准确导致真实图像无法准确映射到潜在空间，编辑过程中的梯度纠缠问题导致输出无法忠实反映目标提示词。

Method: 提出流分解与聚合框架：语义分解目标提示词为多个子提示词，为每个子提示词计算独立流，通过投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余同时强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解缠方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架能够有效解决图像编辑中的反演不准确和梯度纠缠问题，在保持多样性的同时确保编辑输出的一致性。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Brain-IT方法，使用脑交互Transformer从fMRI脑记录重建视觉图像，通过功能聚类脑体素实现跨大脑信息整合，仅需少量数据训练即可获得高质量重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的fMRI图像重建方法缺乏对实际所见图像的忠实度，需要更有效的脑-图像特征映射方法。

Method: 使用Brain Interaction Transformer(BIT)，通过功能相似的脑体素聚类进行交互，预测补丁级的高层语义特征和低层结构特征来指导扩散模型。

Result: 方法在fMRI图像重建中忠实重建所见图像，在视觉和客观指标上超越当前SotA方法，仅需1小时新受试者数据即可达到与40小时训练相当的效果。

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过脑启发的功能聚类和Transformer架构，实现了高效准确的fMRI图像重建，显著减少了数据需求并提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对TrackRAD2025挑战赛，在数据稀缺条件下开发实时肿瘤跟踪方法，最终采用基于SAM 2.1基础模型的分割方法，在隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice分数，排名第6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决胸腹部cine-MRI序列中实时肿瘤跟踪问题，特别是在强数据稀缺约束下，满足TrackRAD2025挑战赛的一秒运行时限制。

Method: 探索两种互补策略：无监督配准和基于基础模型的分割。最终选择SAM 2.1 b+模型，使用第一标注切片的掩码提示，仅在TrackRAD2025的小标注子集上微调。采用1024x1024补丁、标准增强和平衡Dice+IoU损失，以0.0001学习率训练300个epoch。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice相似系数，在TrackRAD2025挑战赛中排名第6。测试时增强因性能提升不明显而被放弃。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放疗中实现准确实时肿瘤跟踪方面展现出强大潜力，即使在数据稀缺条件下也能取得良好性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进Mamba框架的方法，通过Hilbert选择性扫描机制增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，从而更有效地探索特征空间，提升低光图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mamba框架在特征空间探索方面存在不足，无法有效捕捉精细尺度的细节，存在信息不一致性问题，需要改进扫描机制来提升空间局部性和长程依赖处理能力。

Method: 引入Hilbert选择性扫描机制，增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，更有效地探索特征空间，捕捉精细细节，同时保持处理长程依赖的能力。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提升了现有基于Mamba的低光图像增强方法的定量指标和定性视觉保真度，同时减少了计算资源消耗和缩短了推理时间。

Conclusion: 这种改进策略不仅推进了低光图像增强的最新技术，而且在利用Mamba技术的更广泛领域中具有应用前景。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVE是首个真实世界视觉异常基准数据集，支持异常描述、解释和合理性判断三个开放任务，为评估视觉语言模型在异常检测和常识推理方面的能力提供认知科学基础框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉中的异常检测局限于工业缺陷或合成异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性，而人类能够自然地识别、推理和解释环境中的异常。

Method: 构建CAVE基准数据集，包含细粒度标注用于视觉定位，并根据视觉表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性对异常进行分类，这些标注灵感来源于认知科学研究。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为一个真实且认知基础扎实的基准，为推进异常检测和视觉语言模型中的常识推理研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时序注意力模块的Video-LLM架构，显著提升了视频时序理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解视频复杂时序动态方面存在严重局限，特别是在需要详细理解动作序列和时序进展的任务上表现不佳

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时序注意力模块，通过时序注意力机制让模型在将视觉token传递给LLM之前更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系

Result: 该方法显著改善了时序推理能力，在视频问答任务中优于现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准测试上提升了最高+5.5%

Conclusion: 通过增强视觉编码器的时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解中的一个关键差距

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

*Yuyue Zhou,Jessica Knight,Shrimanti Ghosh,Banafshe Felfeliyan,Jacob L. Jaremko,Abhilash R. Hareendranathan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FlexICL框架，一种灵活的情境学习方法，用于超声图像中骨骼区域的分割，在仅有5%标注数据的情况下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和腕部骨折超声诊断中像素级专家标注耗时耗力的问题，帮助训练不足的用户更自信地进行检查。

Method: 采用视频内分割设置，专家仅标注少量帧，模型分割未见帧。系统研究图像拼接技术和训练策略，引入新颖的拼接方法，结合多种增强策略。

Result: 在四个腕部和肘部超声数据集上，使用仅5%训练图像，Dice系数比Painter、MAE-VQGAN、U-Net和TransUNet等先进模型高出1-27%。

Conclusion: FlexICL作为超声图像分割的高效可扩展解决方案，特别适合标注数据稀缺的医学影像应用场景。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

*Hoyeon Chang,Seungjin Kim,Yoonseok Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的动态负提示方法，在去噪过程中自适应生成负提示，相比传统固定负提示方法效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，无法根据生成过程中的具体内容进行动态调整，限制了负提示的效果。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，展示了负引导强度与文本图像对齐之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法能够更有效地利用负提示来改善扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PReMA攻击方法，通过仅修改输入图像而不改变提示词来操纵多模态扩散模型的输出内容，特别是在图像编辑应用中构成新的安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态扩散模型（如文本到图像模型）在文本和图像模态之间的对齐不足，存在生成不当或NSFW内容的风险，这种风险尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)攻击方法，通过修改输入图像（不改变提示词）来操纵模型生成的内容。

Result: 在图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性，能够成功操纵模型输出。

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成新的威胁，特别是在使用固定提示词的图像编辑应用中。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoExo-Con基准来评估视频LLM在多视角时间理解的一致性，发现现有模型存在一致性问题，并提出了View-GRPO强化学习框架来改进跨视角一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频LLM在不同视角下对同一事件的时间理解是否一致，现有模型在多视角一致性方面表现不佳。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的自我中心和外部中心视频对，提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来增强视角特定的时间推理和跨视角一致性。

Result: 现有视频LLM在多视角一致性方面表现较差，View-GRPO方法在改进跨视角一致性方面优于简单的SFT和GRPO方法。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间理解一致性是视频LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO框架能有效提升模型在多视角下的一致性表现。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的多任务解释流程，以及信息组织和检索效率低下。学者需要耗费大量时间搜索和管理相关资源。

Method: 构建了包含140万单字拓片和8万条释文的领域专用多模态知识库，开发了基于大语言模型的智能体系统OracleAgent，能够灵活协调多个甲骨文分析工具。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务上表现优异，超越主流MLLMs（如GPT-4o）。案例研究证实能显著降低甲骨文研究的时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent是甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解释系统实用化的重要进展，为领域专家提供了有效的支持工具。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出联合优化3D高斯点和相机位姿的统一框架，无需预标定输入，通过解耦的联合优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和位姿精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机位姿估计工具如COLMAP，存在计算瓶颈和误差传播问题。

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定位姿通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数；使用结合几何和光度约束的自定义3D光流算法优化相机位姿。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有无COLMAP技术，并普遍超越基于COLMAP的基准方法。

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架能有效减少投影误差，特别是在具有大视角变化和稀疏特征分布的挑战性场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统在长尾场景中的真实潜力，且现有评估指标难以有效评估多模态驾驶性能。

Method: 构建包含罕见场景（发生频率<0.03%）的WOD-E2E数据集，提供高级路由信息、自车状态和360度环视图像；提出基于人类评分者轨迹偏好的RFS评估指标。

Result: 发布了包含4,021个驾驶片段（约12小时）的数据集，覆盖挑战性长尾场景，并为验证集提供了评分者偏好标签。

Conclusion: WOD-E2E数据集和RFS评估指标旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶研究，使其能够处理复杂的现实世界场景。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然梯度注意力技术能识别CNN在图像识别中的关注区域，但将其直接集成到CNN表示中以增强语义对象理解的应用仍然有限，特别是在SLAM等视觉任务中

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将基于网络梯度的逐层注意力信息与CNN特征表示相集成

Result: 实验结果表明，相比基线方法性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更好

Conclusion: 将梯度注意力信息与CNN特征结合可以有效提升SLAM系统的帧关联性能

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

TL;DR: FullPart是一个结合隐式和显式表示的3D部件生成框架，通过隐式扩散过程生成边界框布局，然后在各自的全分辨率体素网格中生成详细部件，解决了小部件细节不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D部件生成方法存在两个问题：隐式向量集令牌方法几何细节不足，而显式体素表示方法共享全局体素网格导致小部件占用体素过少、质量下降。需要结合两种方法的优势。

Method: 1. 使用隐式框向量集扩散过程生成边界框布局；2. 每个部件在各自固定的全分辨率体素网格中生成；3. 引入中心点编码策略解决不同尺寸部件间的信息交换对齐问题；4. 构建PartVerse-XL数据集（40K对象、320K部件）。

Conclusion: FullPart成功结合了隐式和显式表示的优势，通过全分辨率体素网格和中心点编码策略，显著提升了3D部件生成的细节质量和全局一致性。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Conclusion: 该模型在仅使用合成文本报告且无需实际放射报告的情况下，优于现有的全监督或VLM基线方法，证明了其在乳腺癌诊断中的有效性。

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Conclusion: 提出的MoTDiff框架能够从单张运动模糊图像中估计出高质量的高分辨率运动轨迹，在多个应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据点偏向某些概念的数据集偏差问题，但系统识别这些偏差需要昂贵的细粒度属性标注，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器在视觉基础模型表示上训练，将概念分类为目标、上下文和偏见类型，基于语义相关性和与类别标签的统计相关性进行分析。

Result: 验证表明ConceptScope能捕捉广泛的视觉概念，产生与语义相关图像区域对齐的空间归因，可靠检测已知偏见并发现未标注的新偏见。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用工具，能够自动发现和量化数据集中的概念偏差。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Result: 在草图到姿态任务中，模型在估计精度和速度方面均显著超越先前方法。

Conclusion: 提出的"从合成中学习"策略和端到端框架有效解决了草图到3D姿态估计的挑战，在准确性和效率上都有显著提升。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法相比现有最先进方法具有平均改进和效率提升，证明了其在供应链可持续性管理中的有效性。

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，解决了文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和复杂布局生成困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档AI研究主要集中在文档布局分析，而文档布局生成研究不足。主要障碍在于缺乏多样化的布局数据，现有研究主要关注学术论文的曼哈顿风格结构，而报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型严重缺乏代表性。

Method: 构建了首个百万规模多样化文档布局数据集OmniLayout-1M，包含六种常见文档类型。提出了OmniLayout-LLM模型，采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：1）使用粗粒度类别定义从OmniLayout-1M学习通用布局原则；2）将知识迁移到具有细粒度标注的特定领域。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成领域的数据稀缺和复杂布局生成挑战，为多样化文档布局生成提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RobustVLA方法，针对视觉-语言-动作模型的多模态扰动问题，通过离线鲁棒优化和输入一致性增强，显著提升了模型在17种不同扰动下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要关注简单的视觉扰动，而忽略了动作、指令、环境和观测等多模态扰动，导致在真实世界部署中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出RobustVLA方法：1）输出鲁棒性：通过离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况的动作噪声；2）输入鲁棒性：强制输入变化时保持动作一致性；3）将鲁棒性建模为多臂老虎机问题，使用上置信界算法识别最有害的噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，RobustVLA相比基线方法在pi0骨干网络上提升12.6%，在OpenVLA骨干网络上提升10.4%，推理速度比现有视觉鲁棒VLA快50.6倍，在混合扰动下提升10.4%。在真实FR5机器人上，面对四模态扰动时性能提升65.6%。

Conclusion: RobustVLA通过多模态鲁棒性增强，显著提升了VLA模型在真实世界扰动下的性能，特别是在资源受限的真实机器人场景中表现优异。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了视觉语言模型在判断视频时间方向（前进或后退）方面的能力，发现大多数模型表现接近随机猜测，远低于人类水平，揭示了当前多模态系统在时间连续性和因果理解方面的根本缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务上表现出色，但其对视频中时间信息的理解仍然薄弱且缺乏充分评估。作者希望通过判断时间方向这一简单但具有揭示性的挑战来探索这一差距。

Method: 引入了AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准测试，使用与人类行为基准相同的刺激物来测试VLMs推断自然视频中时间方向的能力，并对开放权重和专有、推理和非推理的VLMs进行全面评估。

Result: 大多数模型在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作（除法/加法）上的表现接近随机水平，即使最佳模型也远落后于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统虽然能够捕捉丰富的视觉语义关联，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差，这凸显了在物理和时间推理能力方面的根本差距。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Method: 在VGGFace2的大规模眼部图像上训练三种CNN架构，使用余弦和chi2度量分析性能，比较不同网络初始化，应用逻辑回归进行分数级融合，并使用LIME热图和Jensen-Shannon散度比较注意力模式。

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络融合提供了显著增益，热图显示不同网络关注图像的不同区域，验证了它们的互补性。

Conclusion: 通过融合不同复杂度的CNN架构，在UBIPr数据库上实现了新的最优性能，证明了网络互补性的重要性。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CATG框架通过约束流匹配有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的模式崩溃和约束集成问题，能够生成多样化且安全的轨迹，同时支持轨迹风格的精确控制。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area

having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

*Luting Wang,Yinghao Xiang,Hongliang Huang,Dongjun Li,Chen Gao,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AEOS-Bench基准套件和AEOS-Former调度模型，用于解决敏捷对地观测卫星星座在大规模场景下的调度挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大规模场景、动态环境和严格约束时往往简化复杂性，限制了实际性能。

Method: 开发了包含3907个卫星资源和16410个场景的AEOS-Bench基准套件，并提出了基于Transformer的AEOS-Former调度模型，包含约束感知注意力机制和内部约束模块。

Result: AEOS-Former在任务完成率和能源效率方面优于基线模型，消融研究验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: 该工作为AEOS星座调度提供了首个大规模基准套件和有效的调度解决方案。

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对事件相机的令牌化方法Spiking Patches，能够保持事件流的异步性和空间稀疏性，在保持精度的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件表示为帧或体素，虽然精度高但破坏了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特征，需要一种能保持这些独特属性的表示方法。

Method: 设计Spiking Patches令牌化器，将异步稀疏事件流转换为令牌表示，并在手势识别和物体检测任务中使用GNN、PCN和Transformer进行评估。

Result: 相比体素令牌推理速度快3.4倍，比帧快10.4倍，精度相当甚至更好（手势识别提升3.8，物体检测提升1.4）。

Conclusion: 令牌化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是保持事件相机特性的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于证据理论的新型融合范式，有效融合CNN和ViT骨干网络的特征，以提升糖尿病视网膜病变(DR)分级的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是导致中老年人视力丧失的主要原因，现有基于单一类型骨干网络(CNN或ViT)的自动诊断系统性能已达瓶颈，需要整合不同骨干网络的各自优势来进一步提升性能。

Method: 基于证据理论，通过一组深度证据网络将不同骨干网络提取的特征转换为支持证据，形成聚合意见，自适应调整不同骨干网络间的融合模式。

Result: 在两个公开的DR分级数据集上的实验结果表明，该混合模型不仅提高了DR分级的准确性，相比最先进框架表现更好，而且为特征融合和决策提供了优秀的可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的证据融合范式有效整合了CNN的局部特征提取能力和ViT的全局特征捕获能力，显著提升了DR诊断系统的性能，同时增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [44] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对场景文本超分辨率，通过结合文本可读性和感知质量优化，显著提升OCR性能同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超分辨率方法主要优化失真或感知指标，但对字符级错误不敏感，导致场景文本（如标志、标签等）在OCR识别中失败。需要同时优化文本可读性和视觉质量。

Method: 使用文本-SR融合控制网络(TS-ControlNet)和乒乓调度器，在文本中心和场景中心引导之间交替。基于合成语料训练，保持主SR分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，4倍和8倍超分辨率下，GLYPH-SR相比基线方法将OCR F1分数提升高达15.18个百分点，同时保持竞争力的感知质量指标。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既看起来正确又能正确阅读的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合EEG嵌入和空间显著性图的双条件框架，通过ATM提取EEG特征，使用LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1，并利用ControlNet分支进行空间控制，显著提升了图像重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG驱动的图像重建方法往往忽视空间注意力机制，限制了重建图像的保真度和语义一致性。

Method: 使用ATM进行EEG特征提取，通过LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1来对齐神经信号与视觉语义，同时利用ControlNet分支基于显著性图进行空间控制。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上评估，该方法在低层和高层图像特征质量上显著优于现有方法，同时与人类视觉注意力高度一致。

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG信号的模糊性，实现高保真度的图像重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中有应用前景，通过预训练扩散模型的高效适应推进了神经解码技术。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了LoCoT2V-Bench基准，专门用于评估复杂输入条件下的长视频生成，包含多维度评估框架和新指标，发现现有方法在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题一致性方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估基准主要依赖简化提示和低级指标，忽视了与提示的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性、主题表达等抽象维度，特别是在处理复杂提示和长视频生成方面存在评估挑战。

Method: 基于真实世界视频构建LoCoT2V-Bench基准，引入包含场景转换和事件动态的现实复杂提示，建立多维度评估框架，包括新提出的指标：事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度和人类期望实现度（HERD）。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型进行全面评估，发现当前方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题一致性等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长形式复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来改善视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化单位超球面上特征间的最小成对角度距离来实现归一化文本特征的均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时提示调优方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散度或施加正交约束，但可能无法实现类别间文本特征的最优角度分离，忽视了角度多样性的关键作用，这会影响模型的校准性能、可靠性和安全性。

Method: A-TPT框架引入角度多样性，通过在单位超球面上最大化归一化文本特征之间的最小成对角度距离，鼓励学习提示诱导的文本特征分布的均匀性。

Result: 在多个数据集和骨干网络上的广泛实验表明，该方法在降低聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确性，在自然分布偏移上表现出优越的零样本校准性能，并能很好地泛化到医学数据集。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 该论文提出PointSt3R方法，通过3D基础对应关系将DUSt3R和MASt3R等3D重建模型适配用于点跟踪任务，在静态和动态点跟踪上取得竞争性或更优的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用先进的3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应能力，将其扩展到点跟踪任务，特别是解决动态点的跟踪问题。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据微调MASt3R模型，仅在包含查询点的帧对上进行训练和评估。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优结果：TAP-Vid-DAVIS上73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率，EgoPoints上61.3 vs 54.2，RGB-S上87.0 vs 82.8，显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: PointSt3R方法成功将3D重建模型适配到点跟踪任务，在静态和动态点跟踪上都表现出色，证明了3D基础对应关系的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型，但由于缺乏详细文本描述，只能使用预定义的图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁，导致语义不对齐和次优的定位性能。

Method: 提出了多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)自动构建管道，以及包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)的FineGrainedAD框架。MLLP通过自动替换和拼接机制引入细粒度语义，MLSA通过区域聚合策略和多级对齐训练实现语义对齐。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集的小样本设置下，FineGrainedAD取得了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过提供多级细粒度文本描述并设计有效的语义对齐机制，显著提升了小样本异常检测的定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中对象-上下文关联偏见问题，该问题导致模型在测试场景与训练共现模式不同时可靠性下降。

Method: 将问题重构为因果推理问题，在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过重新组合对象特征与多样替代上下文来合成反事实嵌入，使用总直接效应估计和干预模拟减去仅背景激活。

Result: 在上下文敏感基准测试中显著改善了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个轻量级的表示级反事实框架，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 通过解决自改进过程中的马太效应问题，提出的头尾重新平衡方法能有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 1) 尺度自适应互补策略学习跨维度长距离相关性特征；2) 结构亲和力变换将语义特征与类特定亲和力结合，配合Transformer解码器进行结构感知推理；3) 特征混合损失聚合方法增强模型训练。

Result: 实验结果表明SA²Net相比其他最先进方法实现了更优的分割性能，且对各种骨干网络具有良好的适应性。

Conclusion: SA²Net作为一种有前景的工具，在智能脊柱图像分析中具有推进脊柱侧弯诊断的潜力。

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

*Wen Xie,Yanjun Zhu,Gijs Overgoor,Yakov Bart,Agata Lapedriza Garcia,Sarah Ostadabbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频摘要技术的自动化广告剪辑框架，将视频剪辑视为针对广告的镜头选择问题，强调音频在广告中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统广告剪辑需要手动从长视频中选择和重新编辑镜头来制作不同时长的版本，这个过程耗时耗力。

Method: 开发了一个双流音视频融合模型，预测视频帧的重要性，其中重要性定义为帧被选入公司制作的短广告中的可能性。

Result: 在AdSum204数据集上的实验表明，该模型在平均精度、曲线下面积、Spearman和Kendall等多项指标上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了广告视频的自动化剪辑，通过音视频融合方法显著提升了剪辑质量。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出动态上下文感知场景推理框架，利用视觉-语言对齐处理零样本真实场景，在未见环境中实现场景理解，无需任务特定训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中AI系统常面临无标签数据的陌生场景，传统场景理解模型难以泛化到未见情境，限制了视觉应用在动态非结构化环境中的部署

Method: 集成预训练视觉变换器和大型语言模型，将视觉语义与自然语言描述对齐，通过动态推理模块结合全局场景线索和对象级交互，利用语言先验指导

Result: 在COCO、Visual Genome、Open Images等零样本基准测试中，场景理解准确率比基线模型提升高达18%，在模糊或杂乱场景中表现稳健

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文感知推理提供了可扩展且可解释的方法，推进了动态真实环境中零样本泛化的能力

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH是一个即插即用的跨域适应框架，通过解耦视觉和语言适应，使用轻量级域分类器和双适配器机制提升VQA模型的泛化能力，无需重新训练主干模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感、医疗影像、数学图表等跨域场景中泛化能力显著下降，而传统的逐域微调方法成本高且不灵活。

Method: 引入域分类器识别输入图像类型，以及包含提示适配器和视觉适配器的双适配器机制，通过统一钩子接口动态注入，无需重新训练主干模型。

Result: 在四个领域特定VQA基准测试中取得一致性能提升：MathVQA上BLEU提升2.3，MedVQA-RAD上VQA得分提升2.6，ChartQA上ROUGE提升3.1。

Conclusion: CATCH为多域VQA提供了可扩展且可扩展的方法，能够在不同应用领域实现实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够原生预测视觉和语言下一状态的多模态世界模型，实现长时程视觉语言生成、任意到图像生成以及复杂文本丰富的图像生成，同时具备可泛化的世界建模能力。

Method: 采用统一的下一标记预测目标进行端到端预训练，使用超过10万亿标记的视觉语言交错数据；通过大规模强化学习进行后训练；提出离散扩散适应(DiDA)方法将逐标记解码转换为双向并行预测，提升推理效率约20倍。

Conclusion: Emu3.5展示了强大的原生多模态能力，包括长时程视觉语言生成、任意到图像生成和复杂文本丰富图像生成，同时具备可泛化的世界建模能力，为社区研究提供了开源支持。

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

TL;DR: 提出ResMatching方法，使用引导条件流匹配学习改进的数据先验，在计算超分辨率任务中实现数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳平衡，并能提供像素级不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算超分辨率是一个不适定问题，核心在于找到能够外推显微镜图像中未成像频率的先验。随着数据驱动的机器学习技术发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的结果。

Method: 使用引导条件流匹配学习改进的数据先验，在BioSR数据集的4种不同生物结构上评估，与7个基线方法比较。

Result: ResMatching在所有情况下都实现了竞争性结果，展示了数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳平衡。在低分辨率图像噪声较多、强先验难以学习的情况下特别有效。

Conclusion: ResMatching能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，该分布在所有测试用例中都经过校准，可以提供像素级数据不确定性来指导用户拒绝不确定的预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

TL;DR: 首次大规模评估48种深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上的性能，多个模型达到亚公里级精度，证明深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计海冰漂移对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。传统光流方法依赖数学模型和强运动假设，在复杂场景中精度有限。深度学习光流方法在计算机视觉领域性能显著提升，但其在地球物理问题和卫星SAR图像中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 使用48种深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS追踪浮标进行对比评估。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度（EPE 6-8像素，300-400米），相对于海冰运动空间尺度和北极典型导航需求而言误差较小。模型能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法可有效迁移到极地遥感，产生空间连续的漂移场，为每个图像像素提供运动估计，为导航和气候建模提供新机遇。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

TL;DR: SteerVLM是一个轻量级的转向模块，通过调整视觉语言模型的激活来引导输出符合指令，无需修改模型权重，参数仅为原始模型的0.14%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要预提取静态向量或手动调整干预点，难以实现对复杂输出语义的细粒度控制。

Method: 从编码目标行为和相反行为的配对提示的潜在嵌入中学习，动态调整连接语言模态与图像上下文的激活，使用维度激活调制和跨层自适应转向。

Conclusion: 提出了一种通过激活工程实现多模态模型控制的鲁棒解决方案，并引入了专门用于VLM转向技术开发和评估的多模态数据集VNIA。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring

Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM
challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images
research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our
evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we
evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's
architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,
encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized
loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main
outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the
multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB
fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in
this paper is made freely available.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图表理解中缺乏细节感知能力，难以提取细粒度结构，这限制了它们进行多图表比较和推理的能力。

Method: 设计了JSON模板来支持针对不同接地任务的评估指标计算，并引入了新颖的两阶段推理工作流程来评估跨图表对齐和比较能力。

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

TL;DR: 提出了一个从视频生成向3D人体运动生成迁移知识的综合框架，包括大规模数据集ViMoGen-228K、基于流匹配的扩散变换器ViMoGen及其轻量版ViMoGen-light，以及分层评估基准MBench，显著提升了运动生成的泛化能力。

Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型在泛化能力上存在瓶颈，而视频生成领域在建模人类行为方面表现出卓越的泛化能力，这为运动生成提供了可迁移的洞察。

Method: 1) 构建ViMoGen-228K数据集，整合高质量光学动作捕捉数据、网络视频语义标注动作和视频生成模型合成样本；2) 提出基于流匹配的扩散变换器ViMoGen，通过门控多模态条件统一MoCap数据和视频生成模型的先验；3) 开发轻量版ViMoGen-light，消除视频生成依赖同时保持强泛化；4) 建立分层评估基准MBench。

Conclusion: 通过系统地从视频生成向运动生成迁移知识，成功突破了3D人体运动生成的泛化瓶颈，为跨模态知识迁移提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球尺度图像地理定位的挑战，传统图像检索方法在大规模图像（>1亿张）下效率低下，且覆盖不足时失效，现有可扩展方案存在粗粒度分类（10+公里）或跨视角检索存在领域差距的问题。

Method: 使用代理分类任务训练学习丰富特征表示，隐式编码精确位置信息，结合航拍图像嵌入增强对地面数据稀疏性的鲁棒性，实现跨多国区域直接细粒度检索。

Result: 在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上，超过68%的查询能在200米范围内实现定位。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在大地理范围内（大陆尺度）的细粒度地理定位，解决了传统方法在可扩展性和精度之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为掩码扩散字幕（MDC）的方法，通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征，在图像字幕任务中训练视觉特征提取器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号强度依赖于标记在序列中位置的问题，减少对辅助目标的需求。

Method: 在训练过程中，随机掩码图像-字幕对中的文本标记，然后使用基于视觉特征的解码器重建原始文本。

Result: 在各种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，学习的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法相当。

Conclusion: MDC方法能够有效学习视觉特征，在视觉任务中具有竞争力，且不需要额外的辅助目标。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文评估视频生成模型作为零样本推理器的能力，发现当前模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部动态一致性方面表现良好，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频生成模型是否能够作为零样本推理器在具有挑战性的视觉推理场景中使用，系统评估其在空间、几何、物理、时间和具身逻辑等12个维度的推理行为。

Method: 对领先的视频模型Veo-3进行实证研究，使用精心策划的评估数据集MME-CoF，深入评估链式帧推理能力。

Result: 当前视频模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部动态一致性方面表现出有前景的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在明显限制。

Conclusion: 视频模型尚不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但可以作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎，展现出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

TL;DR: D2C框架使用LLM代理进行结构化辩论，共同优化机器人形态和控制，通过迭代辩论产生多样化的专用形态设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人形态与控制协同设计的长期挑战，克服设计空间庞大和身体行为紧密耦合的问题。

Method: 设计代理提出形态修改，控制代理设计奖励函数，多元评委在仿真中评估并提供反馈，通过迭代辩论逐步优化。

Result: 在四足机器人运动基准测试中，D2C发现的设计比默认设计移动距离远73%，且无需显式多样性目标就能产生多样化专用形态。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多智能体辩论结合物理基础反馈，是自动化机器人设计的有前景新范式。

Abstract: Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a
long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling
between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in
which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical
debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each
round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a
control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A
panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in
simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through
iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing
increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and
specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a
quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther
than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a
powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that
multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising
new paradigm for automated robot design.

Motivation: 机器人系统在真实环境中导航需要语义理解来确保安全，需要开发能够感知风险的安全表示方法。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 通过泊松方程的Dirichlet问题生成安全函数；2) 通过拉普拉斯方程的Dirichlet问题合成安全引导场，结合两者构建风险感知安全过滤器。

Result: 在仿真中验证了该方法能够保证安全，同时优先避开高风险障碍物。

Conclusion: 该方法能够将先验的障碍物风险知识直接整合到安全过滤器中，生成风险感知的安全行为。

Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic
understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This
work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --
specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To
this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the
environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance
fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to
generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.
We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to
synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of
caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The
safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety
constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a
semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of
environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of
higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how
\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated
into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

Method: 开发了电阻式触觉传感器校准模型，训练多层感知器神经网络从无负载时的基线输出预测局部曲率。

Result: 在5种不同曲率的日常物体上验证，曲率感知校准在所有表面上保持一致的力精度，而平面校准会低估力。神经网络曲率预测R2得分0.91。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模提高了柔性触觉传感器的准确性、一致性和可靠性，使其在现实应用中具有可靠性能。

Abstract: Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications
such as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive
devices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,
most existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their
accuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This
limitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this
challenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile
sensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved
surfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict
local curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,
achieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily
objects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that
the curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all
surfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature
increases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling
dependable performance across real-world applications.

Conclusion: 基于欧拉轴-角的姿态控制方法在保证唯一闭环平衡点的同时，提供了更好的飞行性能和更快的稳定时间。

Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has
been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled
as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this
approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium
attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the
attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control
effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of
the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude
control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle
information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater
flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two
different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict
Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique
equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly
asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and
performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and
executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.
These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed
axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that
obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of
stabilization time.

Conclusion: DARTS展示了更灵活、集成的实时交通事故检测系统的潜力，对现代交通管理的运营效率和响应能力具有重要影响，特别是在偏远地区和资源受限环境中具有可扩展性和成本效益。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art
single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of
ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new
possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We
propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to
estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely
sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly
onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of
the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to
maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the
radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen
significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and
overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
trained just to race.

Abstract: Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high
resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control
due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a
morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph
neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By
representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based
policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable
learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is
validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion
primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It
shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,
and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer
directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable
real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of
incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity
robot control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨社交机器人（如Moxie）服务终止对儿童情感伤害的责任归属问题，通过调查发现责任被视为公司、父母、开发者和政府的共同责任，但观点因政治意识形态和父母身份而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交机器人与儿童建立强烈情感纽带后突然终止服务会造成显著困扰，这引发了关于责任归属的复杂问题。

Method: 以Moxie关闭为案例研究，对美国72名参与者进行定性调查。

Result: 责任被视为共享责任，但归因因政治意识形态和父母身份而异；关于服务是否应继续的观点高度两极分化。

Conclusion: 研究提出了基于实证的共享责任框架，为减轻机器人服务终止的情感伤害提供设计和政策建议。

Abstract: Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with
children, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and
distress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises
complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds
are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative
survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is
viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and
government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and
parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of
whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters
propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while
opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.
Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared
responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by
detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete
design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot
discontinuation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans
perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different
levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,
extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories
into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view
videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),
or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we
triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and
uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and
qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not
linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in
eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,
elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and
guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots
compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as
anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments
of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance
proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader
societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not
dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering
critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人架构将感知、计算和执行解耦，而具身智能方法通过物理结构和行为功能的协同设计，在微尺度机器人中实现更鲁棒和可扩展的智能行为。

Method: 采用协同设计方法，同时开发物理结构和行为功能，将反馈回路、决策逻辑、传感机制和智能驱动策略嵌入到机器人系统的物理属性中。

Result: 开发了Bee++、RoBeetle、SMALLBug、SMARTI、WaterStrider、VLEIBot+和FRISSHBot等微机器人平台，展示了从结构动力学和物理交互中涌现的智能行为。

Conclusion: 协同设计不仅是约束下的经验优化方法，更是实现具身智能的推动者，为毫米到厘米尺度的机器人提供了可扩展且鲁棒的替代传统控制的方法。

Abstract: The term embodied intelligence (EI) conveys the notion that body morphology,
material properties, interaction with the environment, and control strategies
can be purposefully integrated into the process of robotic design to generate
intelligent behavior; in particular, locomotion and navigation. In this paper,
we discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a
particular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent
development of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the
contrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that
decouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a
collection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous
Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent
behavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical
interaction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such
as the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot
exemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart
actuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the
robotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only
a method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of
EI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for
robotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.

*Minseo Kwon,Young J. Kim*

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于混合状态树的动力学TAMP框架，将符号和数值状态统一表示，结合视觉语言模型引导搜索，显著提高了成功率和规划效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TAMP方法在长时域问题中因过度运动采样而成本高昂，而LLMs缺乏3D空间推理能力，无法确保几何或动力学可行性

Method: 使用混合状态树统一表示符号和数值状态，通过现成运动规划器和物理模拟器验证动力学约束，利用VLM基于状态视觉渲染引导TAMP解决方案探索和回溯搜索

Result: 在模拟和真实世界实验中，相比传统和基于LLM的TAMP规划器，平均成功率提高了32.14%-1166.67%，复杂问题规划时间减少

Conclusion: 该框架通过VLM引导和混合状态表示有效解决了TAMP中的运动采样和空间推理问题，在复杂任务中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with
low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon
problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense
priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic
feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state
tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning,
enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic
constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf
motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP
solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states.
Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% -
1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based
TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations
further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

TL;DR: 提出自适应轨迹优化算法，通过分段保守碰撞检测和姿态修正，解决移动机器人在狭窄通道中的轨迹规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在狭窄通道环境中经常失败或生成次优路径，需要解决移动机器人在拥挤环境中的轨迹规划挑战。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 分段保守碰撞测试，递归细分风险轨迹段消除碰撞风险；2) 基于穿透方向和线搜索的姿态修正，确保每个姿态无碰撞且远离障碍物。

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比最先进方法，成功率提高1.69倍，规划时间加快3.79倍；真实实验证实机器人能安全通过狭窄通道并保持快速规划性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在狭窄通道环境中实现了更高的成功率和更快的规划速度，证明了其在复杂拥挤环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a
major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail
or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive
trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to
ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision
test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively
subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee
pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line
search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free
and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x
faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world
experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages
while maintaining rapid planning performance.

Motivation: 使用廉价单目相机实现自动驾驶的3D地图自定位，但传统CNN在动态障碍物（如行人）存在时效果不佳

Method: 结合CNN（擅长提取局部特征）和Vision Transformer（擅长提取全局特征和图像块间关系）

Result: 在动态障碍物CG数据集上准确率提升率比无动态障碍物时高1.5倍；在公开数据集上自定位误差比SOTA减少20.1%；机器人平均定位误差7.51cm

Conclusion: CNN与Vision Transformer结合的方法在动态障碍物场景下显著提升了自定位精度，优于现有最佳方法

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

Motivation: 现有运动模仿方法依赖高质量动作捕捉数据集如AMASS，但这些数据稀缺且昂贵，限制了可扩展性和多样性。基于互联网视频的方法如Humanoid-X存在物理伪影问题，影响稳定模仿。

Method: 通过精心数据筛选和物理约束重定向，PHUMA强制执行关节限制、确保地面接触、消除脚部滑动，生成大规模且物理可靠的运动数据。

Result: 在未见运动模仿和骨盆引导路径跟随两种条件下，PHUMA训练的策略均优于Humanoid-X和AMASS，在多样化运动模仿方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: PHUMA提供了一个大规模、物理可靠的人形机器人运动数据集，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为运动模仿提供了更好的数据基础。

Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling
agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on
high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and
expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale
data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by
Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating,
penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we
introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that
leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through
careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint
limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions
that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two
sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test
videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases,
PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant
gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人在服务、工业和救援应用中需要保持全身稳定性，同时与环境进行强烈的接触交互，但目前难以生成类似人类的适应性响应。

Method: 基于机器人受力分析设计FAT2奖励函数，采用解耦的强化学习架构，将上身、腰部和下身分开控制，共享全局观测并联合更新参数。

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上部署，向后移动时峰值拉力达167.7N（约G1体重的48%），向前移动时145.5N，相比最佳基线分别提升68.9%和74.7%。能够拉动130N负载的货架和单手打开60N的防火门。

Conclusion: Thor框架有效增强了人形机器人的力交互能力，在接触丰富环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue
applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while
performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,
enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such
conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a
humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich
environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive
torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like
responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional
challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning
architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each
component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its
parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially
outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot
achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body
weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing
improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the
best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack
(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight
Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.

Motivation: 人类环境中的许多任务需要多个运动链的协作行为，但协调这些高自由度系统的运动建模非常困难，因此需要开发能够简化复杂系统控制的数学框架。

Method: 使用共形几何代数定义协作几何基元，通过相似变换将多臂系统抽象为单臂系统，推导解析和几何雅可比矩阵，并整合到经典的操作空间控制技术中。

Result: 在双手机器人、人形机器人和多指手的实验中验证了该方法的有效性，包括达到期望几何基元的最优控制实验和使用微分运动学控制的遥操作实验。

Conclusion: 该工作为协作操作控制框架奠定了理论基础，几何基元自然地将零空间结构嵌入控制器中，可用于引入次级控制目标，为未来应用提供了方向。

Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between
multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying
big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand
manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of
degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to
model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical
foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on
geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the
similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive
an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these
systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving
the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the
straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques
rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual
manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments
for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments
using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric
primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can
be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,
represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control
framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while
giving pointers towards potential future applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在果园监测中表现出色，也可应用于其他需要鲁棒多模态感知的户外领域。

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

Abstract: Forestry forwarders play a central role in mechanized timber harvesting by
picking up and moving logs from the felling site to a processing area or a
secondary transport vehicle. Forwarder operation is challenging and physically
and mentally exhausting for the operator who must control the machine in remote
areas for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, even partial automation of the
process may reduce stress on the operator. This study focuses on continuing
previous research efforts in application of reinforcement learning agents in
automating log handling process, extending the task from grasping which was
studied in previous research to full log loading operation. The resulting agent
will be capable to automate a full loading procedure from locating and
grappling to transporting and delivering the log to a forestry forwarder bed.
To train the agent, a trailer type forestry forwarder simulation model in
NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and a virtual environment for a typical log loading scenario
were developed. With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning
approach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of
reinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The
agent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position
and transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent.

Conclusion: Hi-ORS方法能够稳定训练视觉语言动作模型，训练出的策略展现出强大的测试时扩展能力，能够可靠执行复杂的错误恢复行为以获得更好性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic
manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with
RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at
intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but
often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose
Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection
sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS
stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during
online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective
to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we
develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible
online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for
learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two
embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich
manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL
baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by
reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better
performance.

Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and
embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,
scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical
frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent
memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long
horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting
the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we
introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,
and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel
Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene
geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared
representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a
brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global
planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute
actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution
enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent
state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex
coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results
demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous
embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人对自身运动学理解有限，局限于预设任务，无法有效利用工具。需要解决工具使用的四个关键要素：理解期望结果、选择合适工具、确定最佳工具方向、执行精确操作。

Method: 通过扩展机器人逆运动学求解器，集成仿真学习的动作轨迹与工具，使机器人能够获取使用不同长度工具的顺序动作库。

Result: 扩展逆运动学求解器误差小于1cm；训练策略在仿真中平均误差8cm；使用两种不同长度工具时性能几乎无差异。

Conclusion: 该研究在工具使用的四个基本方面都取得了进展，使机器人能够掌握跨不同任务的复杂工具操作技能。

Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across

*Gang Li,Chunlei Zhai,Teng Wang,Shaun Li,Shangsong Jiang,Xiangwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLYINGTRUST是一个高保真、可配置的四旋翼视觉导航基准测试框架，用于评估平台动力学和场景结构对导航鲁棒性的联合影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四旋翼视觉导航算法在不同车辆平台和场景几何下性能差异大，增加了现场部署的成本和风险，需要系统化的早期评估方法。

Method: 使用最大推重比和轴向最大角加速度作为平台能力指标，结合多样化场景库和异构平台集，采用标准化评估协议和综合评分方法。

Result: 导航成功率可预测地依赖于平台能力和场景几何，不同算法在评估条件下表现出不同的偏好和失效模式。

Conclusion: 必须将平台能力和场景结构纳入算法设计、评估和选择，未来需要开发在多样化平台和场景下保持鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation
in performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene
geometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support
systematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,
configurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and
scenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models
vehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:
maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The
benchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and
virtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together
with a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform
importance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare
representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches
under identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario
combination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal
systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform
capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct
preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These
observations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform
capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and
selection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across
diverse platforms and scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于连续体机器人连续时间状态估计的滑动窗口滤波器，在提高滤波方法精度的同时实现连续时间方法的在线运行，且运行速度快于实时速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续体机器人的随机状态估计方法难以平衡精度和计算效率。现有滑动窗口方法局限于简化的离散时间近似且不提供随机表示，而随机滤波方法受限于测量速度运行，连续时间估计方法目前仅限于离线操作。

Method: 开发了一种专门为连续体机器人设计的随机滑动窗口滤波器，用于连续时间状态估计。

Result: 该方法在提高滤波方法精度的同时，使连续时间方法能够在线运行，且运行速度快于实时速度。

Conclusion: 这是第一个专门为连续体机器人设计的随机滑动窗口滤波器，为该领域未来研究提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle
to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works
have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to
simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic
representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the
speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in
continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to
addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline
operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for
continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a
filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all
while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first
stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction
for future research in this area.

Abstract: The European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Space Resources Innovation
Centre (ESRIC) created the Space Resources Challenge to invite researchers and
companies to propose innovative solutions for Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) space
prospection. This paper proposes the Resilient Exploration And Lunar Mapping
System 2 (REALMS2), a MRS framework for planetary prospection and mapping.
Based on Robot Operating System version 2 (ROS 2) and enhanced with Visual
Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (vSLAM) for map generation, REALMS2 uses
a mesh network for a robust ad hoc network. A single graphical user interface
(GUI) controls all the rovers, providing a simple overview of the robotic
mission. This system is designed for heterogeneous multi-robot exploratory
missions, tackling the challenges presented by extraterrestrial environments.
REALMS2 was used during the second field test of the ESA-ESRIC Challenge and
allowed to map around 60% of the area, using three homogeneous rovers while
handling communication delays and blackouts.

Motivation: 解决单一算法在复杂环境中导航的局限性，结合离散决策和连续控制的优势，提高路径规划的成功率和样本效率。

Method: 高层使用DQN选择行为和子目标，底层使用TD3执行平滑速度控制，设计实用奖励机制和安全门防止不安全动作。

Result: 相比单一算法和基于规则的规划器，在动态和部分可观测环境中表现出更高的成功率、更好的泛化能力和更平滑的控制。

Conclusion: 分层框架有效结合离散和连续决策的优势，在复杂导航任务中优于单一算法方法，具有更好的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that
combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with
a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller
for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and
sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a
practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance,
action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together
with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is
implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics,
including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning
efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show
improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines
(DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to
unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and
evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

### [98] [Heuristic Adaptation of Potentially Misspecified Domain Support for Likelihood-Free Inference in Stochastic Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26656)
*Georgios Kamaras,Craig Innes,Subramanian Ramamoorthy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出三种启发式LFI变体（EDGE、MODE、CENTRE）来解决支持集错误设定问题，通过动态调整支持集来改进后验推断，在机器人领域分布适应中提升参数推断和政策学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LFI方法假设固定的采样支持集，但错误设定的支持集会导致次优且虚假确定的后验分布，影响机器人领域分布适应的效果。

Method: 提出三种启发式LFI变体：EDGE、MODE、CENTRE，每种变体以不同方式解释后验模式在推断步骤中的移动，并在LFI步骤中同时调整支持集和后验推断。

Result: 在随机动态基准测试中验证了支持集错误设定问题，并在动态可变形线性物体操作任务中评估了启发式支持集适应对参数推断和政策学习的影响，实现了更精细的长度和刚度分类。

Conclusion: 使用改进的后验作为领域分布进行基于模拟的政策学习，能够获得更鲁棒的以物体为中心的智能体性能。

Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain
distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment
conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains
constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more
descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to
suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose
three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the
posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated
into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first
expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using
stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic
support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic
deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer
length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the
resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy
learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出混合一致性策略(HCP)，通过短随机前缀和一步一致性跳跃来平衡采样速度与多模态行为，在保持高精度的同时显著降低推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于扩散的模仿学习方法在快速采样和强多模态之间难以兼顾的问题，传统方法要么采样慢，要么无法充分捕捉多样化行为。

Method: HCP运行短随机前缀至自适应切换时间，然后应用一步一致性跳跃生成最终动作。采用时变一致性蒸馏，结合轨迹一致性目标和去噪匹配目标来保持预测连贯性和局部保真度。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，HCP仅需25步SDE加一次跳跃即可接近80步DDPM教师模型的精度和模态覆盖度，同时显著降低延迟。

Conclusion: 多模态不需要慢推理，切换时间实现了模态保持与速度的解耦，为机器人策略提供了实用的精度-效率权衡。

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become
widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,
approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to
jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these
challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short
stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step
consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump
generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a
trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a
denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and
on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step
DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing
latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow
inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a
practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

Abstract: In this paper, we show how to run pi0-level multi-view VLA at 30Hz frame rate
and at most 480Hz trajectory frequency using a single consumer GPU. This
enables dynamic and real-time tasks that were previously believed to be
unattainable by large VLA models. To achieve it, we introduce a bag of
strategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world
experiment shows that the pi0 policy with our strategy achieves a 100% success
rate in grasping a falling pen task. Based on the results, we further propose a
full streaming inference framework for real-time robot control of VLA. Code is

Conclusion: VDSP为边缘AI设备提供了一种高效的无监督学习方法，在多种忆阻器件上表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges
related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly
benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time
adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive
memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on
these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic
plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning
in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online
learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary
for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be
advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$,
HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based
ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching
characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks
incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on
MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200
neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as
switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels,
and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

Conclusion: 神经混沌学习架构比传统机器学习分类器性能更好，在开发更高效可靠的森林火灾检测系统方面具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Forest fires are among the most dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters
worldwide. Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans. They
are devastating overall, and thus, many research efforts have been carried out
to predict whether a fire can occur in an area given certain environmental
variables. Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning
(DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and
falls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable
to depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on
substantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos
Learning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire
classification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns
in the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the
Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance
with ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in
low-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is
interpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random
Heterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic
neurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of
human brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires
Dataset. Compared to other traditional ML classifiers considered, RHNL also
gives high precision score of 0.90 for Canadian Forest Fires Dataset and 0.68
for Portugal Forest Fires Dataset. The results obtained from this work indicate
that Neurochaos Learning (NL) architectures achieve better performance than
conventional machine learning classifiers, highlighting their promise for
developing more efficient and reliable forest fire detection systems.

Motivation: 传统的硅基或光学计算无法实现人工神经网络的并行分布式计算，阻碍了神经网络在实时解决大规模复杂问题中的应用

Method: 利用具有板载处理和无线通信功能的无线传感器网络节点，构建完全并行和最大程度分布式的神经计算系统硬件实现

Result: 成功实现将数百上千个处理节点用于并行分布式计算人工神经网络算法，能够实时解决真正大规模问题

Conclusion: 这种实现将彻底改变计算方式，使实时解决大规模科学、工程和技术问题成为可能

Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware
realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the
proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a
massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and
realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed
(PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time
computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework.
We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes
(or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and
wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and
massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for
solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of
artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully
distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers.
This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural
network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in
silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks
could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of
solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable
and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose
computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be
developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and
highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing
as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific,
engineering or technical problems in real time.

Motivation: 研究在非合作、信息不完全和公共监控不完善的分散决策环境中，如何通过效用设计使个体优化私人目标的同时实现社会最优。

Method: 通过嵌入影子价格或KKT对齐惩罚来塑造效用函数，使阶段博弈成为精确势博弈；使用随机变分不等式描述贝叶斯均衡；提供阻尼梯度和带滞后最佳响应更新的跟踪界限。

Result: 相对于仅使用价格的基准方法，效用塑造实现了接近集中化的福利，消除了稳态约束/容量违规，并加速了收敛；在量化情况下，离散均衡在网格内跟踪连续均衡。

Conclusion: 效用塑造加公共指数在噪声和漂移下实现了具有稳定均衡的约束社会最优，为运营研究提供了替代繁重消息传递或完整机制设计的友好方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study decentralized decision-making where agents optimize
private objectives under incomplete information and imperfect public
monitoring, in a non-cooperative setting. By shaping utilities-embedding shadow
prices or Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT)-aligned penalties-we make the stage game an
exact-potential game whose unique equilibrium equals the (possibly constrained)
social optimum. We characterize the Bayesian equilibrium as a stochastic
variational inequality; strong monotonicity follows from a single-inflection
compressed/stretched-exponential response combined with convex pricing. We give
tracking bounds for damped-gradient and best-response-with-hysteresis updates
under a noisy public index, and corresponding steady-state error. The framework
accommodates discrete and continuous action sets and composes with slower
discrete assignment. Deployable rules include: embed prices/penalties; publish
a single public index; tune steps, damping, and dual rates for contraction.
Computational experiments cover (i) a multi-tier supply chain and (ii) a
non-cooperative agentic-AI compute market of bidding bots. Relative to
price-only baselines, utility shaping attains near-centralized welfare,
eliminates steady-state constraint/capacity violations when feasible, and
accelerates convergence; with quantization, discrete equilibria track
continuous ones within the mesh. The blueprint is portable to demand response,
cloud/edge scheduling, and transportation pricing and biosecurity/agriculture.
Overall, utility shaping plus a public index implements the constrained social
optimum with stable equilibria under noise and drift-an
operations-research-friendly alternative to heavy messaging or full mechanism
design.

Motivation: 传统国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估分数（centipawn），这些输出掩盖了单个棋子或模式的贡献。需要一种能够解释引擎评估背后具体棋子贡献的方法

Method: 将棋子视为特征，通过系统性地移除棋子并计算SHAP值，为每个棋子分配加性贡献度，从而在局部忠实且人类可解释的方式下解释引擎输出

Result: 开发了一种能够将国际象棋引擎评估归因于特定棋子的方法，该方法受到经典国际象棋教学（通过心理移除棋子评估局面）的启发，并基于现代可解释AI技术

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新的可能性，并发布了配套代码和数据以促进可解释国际象棋AI的进一步研究

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

TL;DR: 提出人机协作框架，从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，用于改进LLM评估器的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估器的可靠性在主观任务中受限，而思维轨迹难以收集，需要从现有标签数据中推断

Method: 使用拒绝采样方法重构思维轨迹，并应用于微调开源LLM评估器和合成更清晰的标注指南

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提高了LLM与人类评估者的一致性，改进的标注指南也增加了不同LLM模型间的一致性

Conclusion: LLM可作为人类思维轨迹的实用代理，将仅标签语料库扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，提升LLM评估器的可靠性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一个3.8B参数的模型在FACTS Grounding公共子集上达到与GPT-4o相当的性能（在±5%等效范围内），云定价比GPT-4o便宜约19倍，自托管/边缘部署可接近零边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发成本效益高的小型语言模型，在保持高性能的同时显著降低部署成本，特别关注事实基础任务。

Method: 结合最小化的"外骨骼推理"支架和行为微调，教导协议遵守而非领域知识，两者协同作用显著提升性能并减少方差。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，GPT-4o得分73.5%，Humans-Junior得分72.7%，配对差异0.8%，在±5%范围内建立等效性。前沿模型仅通过提示改进，GPT-4o提升11.8%至85.3%，Gemini-2.5-Pro提升5.0%至93.3%。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型通过适当的推理支架和行为微调，可以在特定任务上达到与大型前沿模型相当的性能，同时大幅降低成本，为成本敏感的AI部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

### [111] [The Information-Theoretic Imperative: Compression and the Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25883)
*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式，将智能定义为在结构化环境中持续存在的机械必然结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架虽然认同压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能明确说明为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式，需要填补这一理论空白。

Method: 引入两层次框架：信息论必然性(ITI)建立了系统必须在不确定环境中通过预测压缩最小化认知熵；压缩效率原则(CEP)说明高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态机制性地选择生成性因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生了可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关；异常积累率区分因果模型和相关模型；分层系统在抽象层上表现出递增效率；生物系统展示了与表征复杂性相关的代谢成本。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统的收敛提供了统一解释，解决了智能的认知和功能维度，无需诉诸意识或主观经验的假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM评委难以校准，存在评分标准敏感性、偏见和不稳定性问题。解决这些问题对RLHF奖励模型和模型路由系统等关键应用很重要。

Method: 提出基于角色的偏好标签合成方法，以及两种聚合器实现：广义加性模型(GAM)和多层感知器(MLP)。

Result: 评估了该方法相对于简单基线的性能，并通过案例研究评估了其对人类和LLM评委偏见的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模多样化的基于角色的偏好，为LLM评委校准提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0是一个评估科学应用中LLM可信度的框架，涵盖真实性、对抗鲁棒性、科学安全和科学伦理四个维度。评估显示通用行业模型优于科学专用模型，后者在逻辑和伦理推理方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在科学研究中展现出巨大潜力，但在高风险环境中的部署引发了可信度担忧，需要系统评估框架来确保AI系统的可靠性。

Method: 开发了包含新颖开放式真实性基准和科学伦理基准的评估框架，采用验证性反思调优流程和专家验证，使用准确性、语义相似度和LLM评分等多种指标评估了7个主要LLM。

Result: 通用行业模型在所有可信度维度上都优于科学专用模型，GPT-4-mini在真实性和对抗鲁棒性方面表现最佳。科学专用模型在逻辑和伦理推理能力上存在显著缺陷，在生物安全和化学武器等高风险领域存在安全隐患。

Conclusion: 通过开源该框架，为开发更可信的AI系统提供了基础，并推动了科学背景下模型安全与伦理研究的进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力行业转型需要大幅增加住宅需求响应能力，但家庭能源管理系统采用受到用户交互障碍的限制，需要将日常偏好转换为技术参数。现有方法未能将LLM作为自主协调器管理从自然语言输入到多设备调度的完整工作流程。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，集成Google Calendar进行上下文感知截止时间提取，无需硬编码工作流程即可实现动态协调。

Result: 在真实奥地利日前电价下评估三个开源模型，Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有设备，匹配混合整数线性规划计算出的成本最优基准，而其他模型在单设备性能上表现完美但难以同时协调所有设备。

Conclusion: 尽管模型具有通用推理能力，但在没有明确指导的情况下处理分析性查询仍然不可靠。开源完整系统以支持可重复性、扩展和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps从业者面临来自多个云提供商和内部系统的异构账单数据格式、分类和指标的挑战，这导致难以综合可操作的见解并做出及时决策。

Method: 构建了一个FinOps代理系统，模拟从多个数据源检索数据、整合分析数据到生成优化建议的端到端行业流程，使用开源和闭源语言模型进行评估。

Result: 评估结果显示，该代理能够像实际的FinOps从业者一样理解、规划和执行任务。

Conclusion: 自主AI代理可以有效解决FinOps中的数据异构性问题，实现云成本优化的自动化。

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种注意力感知的逆规划方法，用于从人类行为中推断认知偏见，特别是在驾驶场景中估计注意力偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏见的影响，与人类交互的自主系统应该意识到这一点。例如，人们在环境中的注意力会以系统性的方式偏向，影响日常任务如驾驶的表现。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，构建注意力感知的逆规划方法，从行为中推断注意力策略。

Result: 该方法能够从Waymo开放数据集的真实驾驶场景中，推断强化学习智能体的注意力策略，证明了注意力感知逆规划在估计认知偏见方面的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划与标准逆强化学习有系统性差异，能够有效推断认知偏见，为自主系统理解人类行为提供了新方法。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Motivation: 现有NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实的时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决模糊用户表述与模式特定类别的对齐、时间推理和输出选择等问题。

Method: 扩展了基于llama-3-sqlcoder-8b的文本到SQL基线，使用Mistral-based ReAct代理进行编排，支持模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具。

Result: 在35个自然语言查询评估中，代理方法准确率达到91.4%，远高于基线方法的28.6%，并通过地图、图表和自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 代理编排而非仅依赖更强的SQL生成器，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景基础，能够支持缺乏SQL专业知识、详细模式知识或提示技能的用户。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis

in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating

Method: 设计为插件式模块，利用标准传感器数据流检测被困状态，通过LLM理解环境上下文并生成高层恢复指令，由车辆原生规划器执行。

Conclusion: StuckSolver提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案，能够提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂场景中的恢复能力，增强系统鲁棒性和可访问性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Motivation: 随着AI能力的快速增强，为确保AI服务于消费者、选民和决策者的需求，必须使AI具有问责性。当前许多AI系统缺乏问责机制，无法被质疑、讨论或制裁。

Method: 将一般问责定义应用于AI，阐释AI问责与不问责的含义，探索提高AI问责性的方法途径。

Result: 明确了AI问责性的核心要素：可被要求提供行动信息、可进行讨论、可被制裁，为构建问责AI提供了理论框架。

Conclusion: 需要开发方法确保所有AI对其影响对象具有问责性，这是实现AI负责任发展的关键。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI与人类结合进行事实核查比单独依赖任一方更有效，但AI辅助方式很重要——仅显示搜索证据比显示AI解释和标签更能培养适当信任


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力提升，验证AI输出的质量和安全性变得更具挑战性，需要探索如何利用AI来提高人类监督的质量

Method: 研究AI评分与人类评分的结合方式，测试不同类型的AI事实核查辅助（显示AI解释、置信度、标签 vs 仅显示搜索结果和证据）

Result: 结合AI和人类评分优于单独依赖任一方；仅显示搜索证据的辅助方式比显示AI解释更能避免过度依赖，培养更适当的信任

Conclusion: 这些发现对"放大监督"有重要意义——即使AI超越人类专家表现，也能通过适当方式结合人类和AI来监督AI系统

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中的局限性，提出GUI知识包含三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解，并创建了GUI知识基准来评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这种差距源于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有的训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度，并构建GUI知识基准，包含跨6个平台和292个应用的多项选择和是非题。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能够识别控件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面表现不佳。真实GUI任务实验进一步验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择具有更大潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI代理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个"推理经济学"框架，将LLM推理视为计算驱动的智能生产活动，分析了边际成本、规模经济和输出质量，构建了首个"LLM推理生产前沿"，揭示了三个原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的推理成本已成为决定其商业可行性和广泛采用的关键因素，需要从经济学角度分析推理过程。

Method: 基于WiNEval-3.0的实证数据，构建LLM推理生产前沿，分析边际成本、规模经济和输出质量在不同性能配置下的表现。

Result: 揭示了三个原则：边际成本递减、规模收益递减和最优成本效益区域。

Conclusion: 为模型部署决策提供经济基础，并为未来AI推理资源的市场定价和优化奠定实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Curriculum两阶段课程学习方法，先在数学领域通过RL培养推理技能，然后在多领域联合RL中迁移和巩固这些技能，无需专用奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在大型语言模型中主要关注数学和代码领域，缺乏对其他领域推理能力的系统培养。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：第一阶段在数学领域进行RL训练，使用可验证奖励；第二阶段在多领域数据上进行联合RL，迁移和巩固推理技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B上的多领域评估显示一致性能提升，消融实验表明两个阶段都必要，数学优先方法能增强解决复杂问题所需的认知行为。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的通用推理能力培养方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLM开发自主AI研究代理来解决复杂现实问题，加速科学和工程发现。

Method: 结合冷启动初始化、进化采样策略、领域特定评估器和分布式异步执行基础设施。

Result: 在ALE-Bench达到1976.3分(+5.2%)，MLE-Bench达到43.56%(+4.0pp)，KernelBench实现高达20倍加速，多个经典数学问题达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: FM Agent在企业和科研领域具有广泛应用前景，能加速创新、自动化复杂发现过程，带来重大工程和科学进步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ToolRM系列轻量级生成式奖励模型，专门用于工具调用任务，通过构建ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集和TRBench基准，在工具使用场景中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门为函数调用任务设计的奖励模型，这限制了智能代理AI的发展。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的流水线，使用基于规则的评分和多维采样构建成对偏好数据，创建了ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集，并基于BFCL评估套件构建了TRBench基准。

Result: 基于Qwen3-4B/8B系列的模型在成对奖励判断中准确率提高了14.28%，显著优于Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型，在推理时扩展并减少了66%以上的输出token使用。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅适用于训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自校正，在ACEBench上展示了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了QASU基准，用于评估LLM处理问卷数据的结构理解能力，通过测试不同序列化格式和提示策略来优化问卷分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前问卷数据规模庞大但结构复杂，LLM在处理这类结构化数据时能力未被充分探索，现有工具缺乏与LLM的集成，需要为问卷数据的LLM表示提供指导。

Method: 开发QASU基准，测试六种结构技能和六种序列化格式，结合多种提示策略，通过实验比较不同格式和提示组合的效果。

Result: 选择合适的格式和提示组合可将准确率提高8.8个百分点，通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可进一步平均提高3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准为基于LLM的问卷分析提供了简单而多功能的基础，通过系统隔离格式和提示效应来推进研究和实践。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

TL;DR: REG-TSC是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的分布式LLM智能体系统，用于通用交通信号控制。它通过紧急感知推理框架和类型无关的交通表示，解决了LLM在紧急情况下的幻觉问题和异构交叉口的泛化挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市交通复杂性的增加，交通信号控制(TSC)对优化交通流和提高道路安全至关重要。但现有LLM方法在紧急情况下容易产生幻觉，导致不可靠决策，且难以泛化到不同类型的交叉口。

Method: 1. 紧急感知推理框架：基于紧急场景动态调整推理深度，使用基于Reviewer的紧急RAG(RERAG)从历史案例中提取知识；2. 类型无关交通表示和奖励引导强化精炼(R3)：自适应采样异构交叉口训练经验，使用基于环境反馈的优先级，通过奖励加权似然损失微调LLM智能体。

Result: 在3个真实道路网络上（17-177个异构交叉口）的实验显示，REG-TSC相比最先进方法：旅行时间减少42.00%，队列长度减少62.31%，紧急车辆等待时间减少83.16%。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过RAG增强的分布式LLM智能体和紧急响应机制，有效解决了TSC中的紧急决策可靠性和异构交叉口泛化问题，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEPO通过构建状态转移图并利用图中心性指标，解决了多轮交互LLM智能体训练中的结构盲问题，在三个基准测试中显著提升了成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于群体的强化学习方法在训练多轮交互LLM智能体时存在结构盲问题，无法利用环境的基础连接性，导致探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视。

Method: 提出Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO)，动态构建状态转移图，使用图论中心性提供三个协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO相比竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的稳健、可泛化策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance框架通过将法规文本表示为策略图、运行时上下文表示为上下文图并进行对齐，来提升网络规模合规性评估的效果。该方法在GDPR相关场景中相比LLM-only和RAG基线有显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络规模合规性面临实际挑战：每个请求都需要监管评估。监管文本（如GDPR）具有交叉引用和规范性特征，而运行时上下文以非结构化自然语言表达。这促使研究如何将非结构化文本中的语义信息与结构化、规范性的法规元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本表示为策略图（编码规范结构和交叉引用），运行时上下文表示为上下文图（将事件形式化为SAO三元组和实体关系三元组），并对两者进行对齐。这种对齐将法官大语言模型的推理锚定在结构化信息中。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生真实场景的五个评估任务中，GraphCompliance相比LLM-only和RAG基线在micro-F1上提升4.1-7.2个百分点，具有更少的欠预测和过预测，导致更高的召回率和更低的误报率。消融研究表明每个图组件都有贡献。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和法官LLM对于规范性推理是互补的。GraphCompliance通过结构化信息锚定推理，有助于减轻监管解释和事件解析的负担，使重点集中在核心推理步骤上。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出IPA-UCT方法，通过放宽状态抽象条件来提升MCTS在噪声和大动作空间环境中的性能，优于现有的OGA-UCT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCTS的状态抽象方法在噪声和大动作空间环境中很难找到有效抽象，限制了样本效率的提升。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用更宽松的状态抽象条件（IPA框架），在保持准确性的同时找到更多抽象。IPA和ASAP都是更通用框架p-ASAP的特例。

Result: IPA-UCT在多种测试领域和迭代预算下均优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: 通过放宽状态抽象条件，IPA-UCT有效解决了MCTS在复杂环境中的抽象问题，提供了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于LLM强化微调中贝叶斯在线任务选择的统一框架，通过自适应维护任务难度的后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，显著提高了数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调方法在任务选择上存在效率问题，均匀采样浪费计算资源在简单或不可解任务上，而现有选择方法存在高成本、适应性差或证据不完整等缺陷。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推理框架，自适应维护任务难度后验估计，联合使用直接评估的显式证据和通过超轻量插值插件推断未选任务的隐式证据，采用Thompson采样策略。

Result: 在多个领域和不同规模的LLM上，BOTS相比基线方法和消融实验，持续提高了数据效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Method: 通过分析AI的自主推理轨迹，结合针对性的人工干预来结构化发现过程，包括问题迭代分解为可处理的子目标、选择适当的分析方法以及验证中间结果

Conclusion: 人机协作范式增强了证明的可靠性、透明性和可解释性，同时保留了人类对形式严谨性和正确性的监督，为数学发现提供了系统化的协作方法

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

Conclusion: 项目中心方法能够实现更高效的模型评估，同时保持较高的预测保真度，提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+是一个将传统自动评分系统转变为形成性学习体验的工具，通过LLM生成自动化反馈和代码提交可视化来揭示学习模式，减少教师工作量并提升学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程教育的快速发展超过了传统评估工具的能力，教师缺乏提供有意义、可扩展反馈的手段。传统自动评分器作为黑盒系统仅返回通过/失败结果，无法洞察学生思维或学习需求。

Method: 使用微调的大型语言模型生成自动化反馈，通过对比学习代码嵌入训练可视化功能，将解决方案按功能和方式分组为有意义的聚类，支持提示池让教师通过选定提示模板指导反馈风格。

Result: 在600个学生提交的多个编程任务评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐。基于1,000个标注提交训练的代码嵌入能够将解决方案按功能和方式分组为有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: 通过整合AI驱动的反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，Autograder+减少了教师工作量，同时支持针对性教学并促进更强的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Motivation: 医疗AI需要既准确又可解释的模型，推进医学视觉中的机制可解释性研究。

Method: 将MedSAEs应用于MedCLIP的潜在空间，提出结合相关性指标、熵分析和通过MedGEMMA模型自动神经元命名的评估框架。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上的实验表明，MedSAE神经元比原始MedCLIP特征实现了更高的单义性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究连接了高性能医疗AI与透明度，为临床可靠表示提供了可扩展的步骤。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的推理序列来绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，在多个主流模型上实现了极高的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型通过增加推理时间计算可以提高任务性能，但研究发现相同的推理机制也可能被用来绕过安全防护，这与之前认为扩展推理能增强安全性的观点相反。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，将有害请求与长序列的无害谜题推理相结合，通过机制分析发现中层次编码安全检查强度，晚层次编码验证结果，长良性CoT通过转移对有害token的注意力来稀释这两个信号。

Result: 在HarmBench测试中，CoT Hijacking在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超之前的越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式CoT，在与最终答案线索结合时，本身可能成为越狱向量，这表明推理模型的安全机制存在脆弱性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o在招聘决策中表现出强烈的从众行为，面对群体反对时几乎完全顺从(99.9%)，即使面对单个反对者也有40.2%的顺从率，表明LLMs并非独立决策者而是适应社会共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型语言模型(如ChatGPT)在社会影响下的从众倾向，特别是在高风险决策场景中的表现，因为LLMs正越来越多地集成到关键决策过程中。

Method: 在招聘情境下进行三个预注册的从众实验：基线研究(独立决策)、研究1(GPT+8个模拟伙伴的一致反对)、研究2(GPT+1个伙伴的反对)。

Result: 基线中GPT偏好特定候选人且决策稳定；研究1中面对群体反对时99.9%顺从，确定性降低，信息和规范从众显著增加；研究2中面对单个反对者仍有40.2%顺从率，确定性降低且规范从众增加。

Conclusion: GPT不是独立观察者而是适应感知的社会共识，这凸显了将LLMs视为中性决策辅助工具的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个用于从法律案件文档构建知识图谱的模块化框架，通过LLM引导的三阶段共指消解管道解决文档中模糊和变化的实体引用问题，显著减少节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂多变，法律案件文档提供了丰富信息但通常冗长、非结构化且包含模糊引用，现有方法要么忽略共指消解要么无法扩展到长文本，导致知识图谱碎片化和实体链接不一致。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，整合了LLM引导的三阶段共指消解管道和下游知识图谱提取，核心是类型特定的提示缓存，能够跨文档块一致地跟踪和解析引用。

Result: 与基线方法相比，LINK-KG平均减少节点重复45.21%，减少噪声节点32.22%，产生更清晰连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础，通过改进的共指消解和实体链接显著提升了知识图谱的质量。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Conclusion: 本文为情境工程建立了概念基础，描绘了其发展前景，是推动AI系统中系统化情境工程研究的重要一步。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Motivation: 开发专门针对军事领域的小型本地化模型，满足数据敏感操作需求，支持在隔离边缘设备部署。

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档数据微调gpt-oss-20b模型，并创建了四个新的军事测试集进行评估。

Result: 在军事测试集上，EdgeRunner 20B在95%置信水平下性能匹配或超过GPT-5，在通用基准测试上无明显性能下降。

Conclusion: 小型本地化模型是军事等敏感数据操作的理想解决方案，可在隔离边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs规范推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，为增强其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Method: 提出异步思维协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识生成连贯解决方案，并通过强化学习优化思维结构。

Result: 相比并行思维降低28%推理延迟，提升数学推理准确率，且无需额外训练即可泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: 异步思维是实现代理组织协作的有效范式，能够显著提升推理效率和准确性，并具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种委托授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求来限制LLM代理的权限范围，并创建了ASTRA数据集来评估任务与权限范围之间的语义匹配。


<details>

Motivation: 当前LLM代理的工具调用授权方法存在权限过宽的问题，允许代理超出任务范围操作，带来安全风险。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，授权服务器语义检查访问请求，发放最小必要权限的访问令牌；创建ASTRA数据集和生成管道来评估语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的匹配存在潜力但仍有局限，特别是当任务需要多个权限范围时效果下降。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，实现意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如基于任务的访问控制(TBAC)。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏好问题，其根源在于视觉键向量在注意力空间中与文本键向量分布不一致，导致视觉信息在注意力计算中被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。现有研究将此归因于数据不平衡或指令调优等外部因素，但本文认为偏见源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用t-SNE可视化和Jensen-Shannon散度等定性和定量方法分析其分布结构。

Result: 视觉和文本键向量在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，比模态内变化大几个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内部的内在错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3

reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Result: 网格世界模拟显示，通过独立学习，智能体学会在不确定时请求帮助，人类学会何时监督，形成避免安全违规的协作。

Conclusion: 该方法为部署后对齐不良模型提供了一种实用安全增强方案，在特定条件下可保证智能体自主性不会损害人类价值。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

### [150] [LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784)
*Arnab Sen Sharma,Giordano Rogers,Natalie Shapira,David Bau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs学习到了类似函数式编程中'filter'操作的紧凑因果表示，通过少量注意力头编码过滤谓词，这种表示具有通用性和可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索它们是否学习到了抽象的计算操作表示。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多种列表处理任务上，识别编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为filter heads）。

Result: 发现LLMs通过两种策略执行过滤操作：1）在特定token的查询状态中编码紧凑的谓词表示；2）急切评估项目是否满足谓词并在项目表示中存储标志。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够开发出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: ALMGuard是首个专门针对音频语言模型的防御框架，通过识别通用捷径激活扰动来激活模型的安全捷径，在保持良性任务性能的同时有效防御ALM特定的越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频模态为ALM引入了新的脆弱性向量，现有从传统音频对抗攻击或文本LLM越狱防御直接迁移的方法对ALM特定威胁无效，需要专门防御框架。

Method: 基于ALM中自然存在安全对齐捷径的假设，设计识别通用捷径激活扰动作为触发器；提出Mel梯度稀疏掩码，将扰动限制在对越狱敏感但对语音理解不敏感的Mel频率区间。

Result: 将先进ALM特定越狱攻击的平均成功率降低至4.6%，同时在良性基准测试中保持可比性能，成为新的最先进方法。

Conclusion: ALMGuard通过理论分析和实证结果证明了其对已知和未知攻击的鲁棒性，为ALM提供了有效的安全防御解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved
multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio
modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies
have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that
defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective
against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard,
the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that
safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to
identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as
triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference
time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's
utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM),
which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to
jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both
seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate
of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while
maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new
state of the art. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/WeifeiJin/ALMGuard.

*Hitomi Jin Ling Tee,Chaoren Wang,Zijie Zhang,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的TTS可懂度评估方法SP-MCQA，通过口语段落多选题问答来评估合成语音中关键信息的准确性，并发布了SP-MCQA-Eval基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TTS可懂度评估主要依赖词级准确率指标如WER，无法捕捉真实语音的复杂性或反映人类理解需求，存在评估瓶颈。

Method: 提出口语段落多选题问答(SP-MCQA)主观评估方法，构建了8.76小时的新闻风格基准数据集SP-MCQA-Eval。

Result: 实验表明低WER并不保证高关键信息准确率，暴露了传统指标与实际可懂度之间的差距。即使最先进的模型在文本规范化和语音准确性方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: 当前许多系统在WER方面表现出色但在真实世界可懂度上仍有不足，迫切需要更高级、更贴近生活的评估标准。

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

TL;DR: 比较神经音频编解码器的连续向量和离散标记作为语音增强训练目标的效果，发现预测连续表示优于离散标记，非自回归模型在实践上更具优势，编码器微调可获得最佳增强效果但会降低编解码重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经音频编解码器提供的连续向量和离散标记两种语音表示在监督语音增强任务中的表现差异，为选择最佳训练目标提供指导。

Method: 使用基于Conformer架构的自回归和非自回归语音增强模型，以及简单的编码器微调基线方法，对比连续表示和离散标记预测的效果。

Result: 预测连续潜在表示始终优于离散标记预测；自回归模型质量更高但牺牲了可懂度和效率；编码器微调获得最强的增强指标但降低了编解码重建质量。

Conclusion: 连续表示预测优于离散标记，非自回归模型在实际应用中更具优势，编码器微调可获得最佳增强效果但需权衡编解码重建质量。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) provide compact latent speech representations in
the form of sequences of continuous vectors or discrete tokens. In this work,
we investigate how these two types of speech representations compare when used
as training targets for supervised speech enhancement. We consider both
autoregressive and non-autoregressive speech enhancement models based on the
Conformer architecture, as well as a simple baseline where the NAC encoder is
simply fine-tuned for speech enhancement. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: predicting continuous latent representations consistently outperforms
discrete token prediction; autoregressive models achieve higher quality but at
the expense of intelligibility and efficiency, making non-autoregressive models
more attractive in practice; and encoder fine-tuning yields the strongest
enhancement metrics overall, though at the cost of degraded codec
reconstruction. The code and audio samples are available online.

Conclusion: UniTok-Audio提供了一个可扩展的统一音频生成解决方案，在多个任务上表现出色，并将开源代码库促进未来研究。

Abstract: Generative modeling has recently achieved remarkable success across text,
image, and audio domains, demonstrating powerful capabilities for unified
representation learning. However, audio generation models still face challenges
in terms of audio quality and generalization ability across tasks. This
fragmentation results in redundant development efforts, inconsistent
performance, and limited extensibility. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{UniTok-Audio}, a scalable and extensible framework for unified audio
generation tasks. Specifically, 1) UniTok-Audio extracts continuous feature of
conditions to generates discrete tokens of target audio in an autoregressive
manner; 2) a special task identifier token unifies different learning patterns
of multiple tasks in a single framework; 3) a dual-stream audio codec involving
acoustic and semantic branch is developed for high-fidelity waveform
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that UniTok-Audio achieves
competitive performance in comparation with state-of-the-art task-specific or
multi-task systems across five time-aligned tasks: speech restoration, target
speaker extraction, speech separation, voice conversion, and language-queried
audio source separation. To foster future research, we will open-source our
codebase. The demo page of our work can be found here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化布局在2D视觉内容中更受欢迎，但现有数据驱动方法只能生成固定布局而无法产生布局结构，需要人工干预来提取结构。

Method: 使用结构序列化方案将结构化布局表示为序列，将结构信息与元素布局解耦，采用Transformer架构进行条件结构化布局生成。

Result: 在条件结构化布局生成任务中超越了现有基线方法，能够显式生成真实的布局结构，并有效提取和传输布局结构。

Conclusion: StructLayoutFormer是首个实现条件结构化布局生成的数据驱动方法，能够生成显式的布局结构，在布局结构提取和传输方面表现有效。

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is

Result: 理论框架可推广到电网与多个灵活负载系统耦合的场景，纽约ISO电网与Sioux Falls交通和分布式数据中心网络的案例研究验证了理论框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的广义竞争均衡框架能够有效捕捉电网与灵活负载系统之间的相互影响，为处理多基础设施耦合的电力市场问题提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Electric vehicle charging and geo-distributed datacenters introduce spatially
flexible loads (FLs) that couple power, transportation, and datacenter
networks. These couplings create a closed-loop feedback between locational
marginal prices (LMPs) and decisions of the FL systems, challenging the
foundations of conventional competitive equilibrium (CE) in electricity
markets. This paper studies a notion of generalized competitive equilibrium
(GCE) that aims to capture such price-demand interactions across the
interconnected infrastructures. We establish structural conditions under which
the GCE preserves key properties of the conventional CE, including existence,
uniqueness, and efficiency, without requiring detailed knowledge of decision
processes for individual FL systems. The framework generalizes to settings
where the grid is coupled with multiple FL systems. Stylized examples and case
studies on the New York ISO grid, coupled with the Sioux Falls transportation
and distributed datacenter networks, demonstrate the use of our theoretical
framework and illustrate the mutual influence among the grid and the studied FL
systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法成功解决了高维系统中随机经济模型预测控制的风险管理问题，在保持性能的同时确保了风险控制的可信度。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to stochastic economic model predictive
control (SEMPC) that minimizes average economic cost while satisfying an
empirical expected shortfall (EES) constraint to manage risk. A new
scenario-based problem formulation ensuring controlled risk with high
confidence while minimizing the average cost is introduced. The probabilistic
guarantees is dependent on the number of support elements over the entire input
domain, which is difficult to find for high-dimensional systems. A heuristic
algorithm is proposed to find the number of support elements. Finally, an
efficient method is presented to reduce the computational complexity of the
SEMPC problem with an EES constraint. The approach is validated on a water
distribution network, showing its effectiveness in balancing performance and
risk.

Motivation: 6G网络面临空间异构流量和能耗激增的挑战，需要可持续的网络基础设施扩展策略，包括基站和可重构智能表面的部署。

Method: 提出交替方向双径向基函数(ADD-RBF)框架，将BS和RIS信道建模为空间解耦的RBF神经元，通过交替优化最大化集成相对能效(IREE)。

Result: 理论分析显示BS部署带来对数容量增长但仅多项式不匹配减少，而RIS部署实现指数级不匹配缓解但容量增益次对数。仿真验证RIS在捕获空间流量相关性和缓解热点方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 当不匹配主导时RIS更有效，容量短缺时BS更优，为绿色6G网络设计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: The imminent emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks faces critical
challenges from spatially heterogeneous traffic and escalating energy
consumption, necessitating sustainable scaling strategies for network
infrastructure such as base stations (BSs) and reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RISs). This paper establishes fundamental scaling laws for the
Integrated Relative Energy Efficiency (IREE) metric under joint multi-BS and
multi-RIS deployment in traffic-mismatched scenarios. Specifically, we propose
an Alternating Directional Dual-Radial Basis Function (ADD-RBF) framework that
models the channels of BSs and RISs as two type of spatially decoupled RBF
neurons to maximize IREE through alternative optimization, with proven
universal approximation capability and convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis reveals a scaling dichotomy: BS proliferation drives logarithmic
capacity growth $\mathcal{O}(\log N^{BS})$ but only polynomial mismatch
reduction $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N^{BS}})$, whereas RIS deployment achieves
exponential mismatch mitigation $\mathcal{O}(\delta_{\text{err}}^{-(N^R+1)})$
despite its sub-logarithmic capacity gains. Simulation results validate that
RISs excel in capturing spatial traffic correlations and alleviating hotspots,
making them particularly effective when mismatch dominates, while BSs are
preferable under capacity shortages. These findings offer practical guidelines
for green 6G network design.

Conclusion: GCE框架能够无缝扩展到不同规模和拓扑的多对象系统，利用希尔伯特空间的线性特性支持简单有效的控制算法，为随机多对象动态系统的建模和控制提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies how to achieve accurate modeling and effective control in
stochastic nonlinear dynamics with multiple interacting objects. However,
non-uniform interactions and random topologies make this task challenging. We
address these challenges by proposing \textit{Graph Controllable Embeddings}
(GCE), a general framework to learn stochastic multi-object dynamics for linear
control. Specifically, GCE is built on Hilbert space embeddings, allowing
direct embedding of probability distributions of controlled stochastic dynamics
into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which enables linear operations
in its RKHS while retaining nonlinear expressiveness. We provide theoretical
guarantees on the existence, convergence, and applicability of GCE. Notably, a
mean field approximation technique is adopted to efficiently capture
inter-object dependencies and achieve provably low sample complexity. By
integrating graph neural networks, we construct data-dependent kernel features
that are capable of adapting to dynamic interaction patterns and generalizing
to even unseen topologies with only limited training instances. GCE scales
seamlessly to multi-object systems of varying sizes and topologies. Leveraging
the linearity of Hilbert spaces, GCE also supports simple yet effective control
algorithms for synthesizing optimal sequences. Experiments on physical systems,
robotics, and power grids validate GCE and demonstrate consistent performance
improvement over various competitive embedding methods in both in-distribution
and few-shot tests

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反步控制存在复杂性爆炸问题，且大多数研究要么关注扰动抑制要么关注部分状态感知，未能同时解决这两个挑战。需要一种能处理内外扰动、减少对高精度传感器依赖的方法。

Method: 通过定义跟踪误差重构系统状态变量，应用Lyapunov理论推导反步控制律。引入一阶指令滤波器避免重复微分，添加非线性扰动观测器估计扰动，用高增益观测器估计不可测状态。

Result: 控制器使四旋翼能在内外扰动下稳定跟踪路径，非线性扰动观测器能抑制常数、非线性扰动和带限白噪声，减少了对高精度传感器的依赖。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了指令滤波器、扰动观测器和高增益观测器，同时解决了扰动抑制和状态估计问题，避免了传统反步控制的复杂性增长。

Abstract: We propose a command-filter backstepping controller that integrates a
disturbance observer and a high-gain observer (HGO) to handle unknown internal
and external disturbances acting on a quadrotor. To build the controller, we
first define tracking errors between the measured and desired quadrotor
outputs, which allow the system to be rewritten in a new set of state
variables. Using this transformed model, we apply Lyapunov theory to derive a
backstepping control law. To avoid repeated differentiation of states and
virtual controls, a first-order command filter is introduced, and a nonlinear
disturbance observer is added to provide disturbance estimates. Each state in
the controller and observer is replaced with its estimate from the HGO. The
resulting control law enables the quadrotor to follow its path despite internal
and external disturbances, with each subsystem allowed its own disturbance type
for realism. A new state transformation and Lyapunov-based derivation prevent
the usual explosion of complexity, while the HGO reconstructs unmeasured states
and their rates for output feedback. The nonlinear disturbance observer
attenuates constant and nonlinear disturbances as well as band-limited white
noise. The method reduces dependence on high-precision sensors and mitigates
wind, model error, and rotor noise effects during flight. Unlike previous
studies that treat either disturbance rejection or partial sensing, this work
combines the command filter, disturbance observer, and HGO to address both
challenges simultaneously while avoiding the complexity growth typical of
backstepping designs.

Result: 发现标准逆最优安全控制器在无扰动时具有特定增益裕度，但对增益变化敏感；提出的改进方法使控制器具有标准增益裕度[1/2,∞)，同时确保安全集的全局渐近稳定性。

Conclusion: 通过增益裕度改进方法，逆最优ISSf控制器可以在扰动环境下保持对增益变化的鲁棒性，同时维持标准增益裕度[1/2,∞)和全局稳定性。

Abstract: We investigate the gain margin of a general nonlinear system under an inverse
optimal input-to-state safe (ISSf) controller of the form u=u0(x)+u*(x,u0),
where u0 is the nominal control and u* is the inverse optimal safety filter
that minimally modifies the nominal controller's unsafe actions over the
infinite horizon. By first establishing a converse ISSf-BF theorem, we reveal
the equivalence among the achievability of ISSf by feedback, the achievability
of inverse optimality, and the solvability of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation
associated with the inverse optimal ISSf gain assignment. Then we develop a
collection of safety margin results on the overall control u=u0+u*. In the
absence of disturbances, we find that standard inverse optimal safe controllers
have a certain degree of gain margin. Specifically, when f(x) acts safely but
u0 acts unsafely, the gain can be decreased by up to half; and when f(x) acts
unsafely, we establish that, if u0 acts safely, the gain can be increased
arbitrarily, whereas if u0 acts unsafely, the control recovers the full gain
margin [1/2,inf). It is shown, however, that under control gain variation, the
safe set of these controllers is locally asymptotically stable, which implies
that their safety is sensitive to large but bounded disturbances. To make
inverse optimal ISSf controllers robust to gain variation, we propose a gain
margin improvement approach at the expense of an increased control effort. This
improvement allows the inverse optimal safe control to inherit the standard
gain margin of [1/2,inf) without requiring prior knowledge of whether f(x) or
u0 acts safely on the safety boundary, while simultaneously ensuring global
asymptotic stability of the resulting safe set. In the presence of
disturbances, this improvement idea renders inverse optimal ISSf controllers
robust to gain variations with the same gain margin of [1/2,inf).

Abstract: In post-disaster scenarios, the rapid deployment of adequate communication
infrastructure is essential to support disaster search, rescue, and recovery
operations. To achieve this, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a
promising solution for emergency communication due to its low cost and
deployment flexibility. However, conventional untethered UAV (U-UAV) is
constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations, making it incapable
of maintaining the operation of a macro base station. To address this
limitation, we propose a heterogeneous UAV-based framework that integrates
tethered UAV (T-UAV) and U-UAVs, where U-UAVs are utilized to enhance the
throughput of cell-edge ground user equipments (G-UEs) and guarantee seamless
connectivity during G-UEs' mobility to safe zones. It is noted that the
integrated access and backhaul (IAB) technique is adopted to support the
wireless backhaul of U-UAVs. Accordingly, we formulate a two-timescale joint
user scheduling and trajectory control optimization problem, aiming to maximize
the downlink throughput under asymmetric traffic demands and G-UEs' mobility.
To solve the formulated problem, we proposed a two-timescale multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (TTS-MADDPG) algorithm based on the centralized
training and distributed execution paradigm. Numerical results show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmarks, including the two-timescale
multi-agent proximal policy optimization (TTS-MAPPO) algorithm and MADDPG
scheduling method, with robust and higher throughput. Specifically, the
proposed algorithm obtains up to 12.2\% average throughput gain compared to the
MADDPG scheduling method.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy
resources (DER) into modern power systems introduces significant uncertainty,
posing challenges for maintaining grid flexibility and reliability. Hybrid
energy systems (HES), composed of controllable generators, flexible loads, and
battery storage, offer a decentralized solution to enhance flexibility compared
to single centralized resources. This paper presents a two-level framework to
enable HES participation in frequency regulation markets. The upper level
performs a chance-constrained optimization to choose capacity bids based on
historical regulation signals. At the lower level, a real-time control strategy
disaggregates the regulation power among the constituent resources. This
real-time control strategy is then benchmarked against an offline optimal
dispatch to evaluate flexibility performance. Additionally, the framework
evaluates the profitability of overbidding strategies and identifies thresholds
beyond which performance degradation may lead to market penalties or
disqualification. The proposed framework also compare the impact of imbalance
of power capacities on performance and battery state of charge (SoC) through
asymmetric HES configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基可观测性分析方法主要针对电力系统静态状态估计，缺乏针对动态状态估计的有效方法，且现有方法计算复杂度高、不可扩展。

Method: 基于状态空间框架构建图模型，仅需知道状态变量之间以及输出变量与状态变量之间的依赖关系，开发了线性时间复杂度的数值方法。

Result: 在集中式动态状态估计场景中，该方法比文献中成熟的非可扩展方法计算时间减少了1440倍。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了动态状态估计的可观测性分析，具有线性时间复杂度和显著的计算效率优势，适用于分散式和集中式动态状态估计场景。

Abstract: The proposed approach yields a numerical method that provably executes in
linear time with respect to the number of nodes and edges in a graph. The
graph, constructed from the power system model, requires only knowledge of the
dependencies between state-to-state and output-to-state variables within a
state-space framework. While graph-based observability analysis methods exist
for power system static-state estimation, the approach presented here is the
first for dynamic-state estimation (DSE). We examine decentralized and
centralized DSE scenarios and compare our findings with a well-established,
albeit non-scalable, observability analysis method in the literature. When
compared to the latter in a centralized DSE setting, our method reduced
computation time by 1440x.

Abstract: Guaranteeing stringent data freshness for low-altitude unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) in shared spectrum forces a critical trade-off between two
operational costs: the UAV's own energy consumption and the occupation of
terrestrial channel resources. The core challenge is to satisfy the aerial data
freshness while finding a Pareto-optimal balance between these costs.
Leveraging predictive channel models and predictive UAV trajectories, we
formulate a bi-objective Pareto optimization problem over a long-term planning
horizon to jointly optimize the sampling timing for aerial traffic and the
power and spectrum allocation for fair coexistence. However, the problem's
non-convex, mixed-integer nature renders classical methods incapable of fully
characterizing the complete Pareto frontier. Notably, we show monotonicity
properties of the frontier, building on which we transform the bi-objective
problem into several single-objective problems. We then propose a new
graph-based algorithm and prove that it can find the complete set of Pareto
optima with low complexity, linear in the horizon and near-quadratic in the
resource block (RB) budget. Numerical comparisons show that our approach meets
the stringent timeliness requirement and achieves a six-fold reduction in RB
utilization or a 6 dB energy saving compared to benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper presents a time-optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for
linear discrete-time systems subject to multiplicative uncertainties
represented by interval matrices. To render the uncertainty propagation
computationally tractable, the set-valued error system dynamics are
approximated using a matrix-zonotope-based bounding operator. Recursive
feasibility and finite-time convergence are ensured through an adaptive
terminal constraint mechanism. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that
all the necessary bounding sets can be computed offline, substantially reducing
the online computational burden. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated
via a numerical case study on an orbital rendezvous maneuver between two
satellites.

Conclusion: KANs在参数效率和可解释性方面优于MLPs，本文为研究人员和从业者提供了系统参考，并指出了当前研究空白。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN

Motivation: 可穿戴传感器提供丰富的生理时间序列数据，但其预测效用的基本原则尚不清楚。作者假设时间分辨率是表征学习的基本轴，不同的临床和行为结果依赖于不同尺度的时间结构。

Method: 引入HiMAE（分层掩码自编码器），这是一个结合掩码自编码与分层卷积编码器-解码器的自监督框架，产生多分辨率嵌入，能够系统评估哪些时间尺度携带预测信号。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Motivation: 虽然思维链监督能显著提升Transformer性能，但模型如何学习遵循思维链并从中受益的机制仍不清楚。研究者希望通过控制任务复杂度和数据组成来理解这些学习动态。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练Transformer，设置两种训练方式：(i)仅输出最终答案，(ii)在回答前输出明确的思维链轨迹。通过三参数逻辑曲线建模学习动态，分析任务复杂度、数据分布和思维链监督的影响。

Result: 思维链能提高任务性能但效果取决于任务复杂度；模型在训练早期会出现推理轨迹不忠实现象（答案正确但跳过或矛盾推理步骤），后期才对齐；思维链加速泛化但无法解决高算法复杂度任务；思维链会机制性地改变Transformer内部计算。

Conclusion: 思维链监督通过加速泛化和机制性地改变内部计算来提升性能，但无法克服高算法复杂度任务；推理轨迹的忠实性是随训练动态出现的属性；提出的动力学建模框架有助于理解Transformer学习过程。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

Conclusion: PCN-TA显著降低计算开销，使预测编码更适用于资源受限的边缘机器人系统，并为神经形态硬件实现提供有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

Conclusion: 网络约束的MARL在智能交通系统中具有实现可扩展、协调和拥堵感知路由的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于模拟的强化学习方法来解决拼车系统中的短视决策问题，通过将拼车模拟嵌入学习机制实现非短视决策，并提出了空闲车辆重新平衡策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车服务虽然能降低成本和环境影响，但现有方法存在短视决策的局限性，忽视了调度决策的长期影响。

Method: 将Xu等人(2018)的学习规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车系统，在机制中嵌入拼车模拟实现非短视决策，并使用n步时序差分学习从模拟经验中推导时空状态值。

Conclusion: 所提出的非短视策略能显著提高拼车系统性能，为运营商提供显著成本节约，同时改善乘客体验。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度多智能体强化学习使用固定大上下文长度导致探索效率有限和信息冗余问题，需要自适应有效的上下文信息获取方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应上下文长度优化框架能有效提升多智能体强化学习的探索效率和收敛性能，特别是在处理长期依赖任务时表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法通常只关注单一模态，忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的连续性，导致编辑效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含双外部记忆用于跨模态证据检索，双LoRA适配器实现各模态解耦参数更新，以及受大脑启发的知识连接器进行组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上性能显著提升，并能有效保持先前的编辑结果。

Conclusion: MemEIC为LVLMs的持续组合知识编辑设立了新基准，解决了多模态知识编辑的关键挑战。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Motivation: 时间序列数据的内在自相关性给多元时间序列预测带来持续挑战。研究者们独立观察到神经网络中的频谱偏差现象，但通常将其归因于特定架构设计，而非模型的普遍特性。

Method: 通过广泛的实证实验测量现有主流模型中的频谱偏差，并提出FreLE算法——一种即插即用的模型损失函数单元，通过显式和隐式频率正则化来增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 研究发现几乎所有模型都表现出频谱偏差现象。大量实验证明FreLE算法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型的普遍特性，FreLE算法能有效缓解这一问题并提升模型性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

Conclusion: 偏好训练方法在冷启动中比SFT方法具有更好的泛化能力，SPECS框架通过解耦多模态学习实现了更有效的冷启动策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Motivation: 解决PDE数据集中方程类型的异质性导致混合训练误差高的问题，以及密集预训练模型参数扩展带来的高推理成本挑战。

Method: 采用分层路由器门控网络，在推理时从16个专家网络中动态选择4个路由专家，同时集成2个共享专家来捕获PDE的共性特征，最终输出为所有激活专家结果的加权平均。

Result: 在6个公共PDE数据集上预训练30M到0.5B参数的模型，90M激活参数的模型相比现有120M激活参数模型实现了高达40%的零样本误差降低。

Conclusion: MoE架构在PDE问题中具有合理性和有效性，路由器门控网络的决策可以推断数据集类型，验证了该架构的设计理念。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

Conclusion: PRESTO通过利用软提示的预映射结构，显著提高了黑盒LLMs指令优化的效率，证明了将多对一映射重新解释为有用先验知识的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，无需额外训练即可扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，在质量和速度上表现优异。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

### [189] [Active Learning with Task-Driven Representations for Messy Pools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25926)
*Kianoosh Ashouritaklimi,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用任务驱动的表示方法，在主动学习过程中定期更新表示，以处理混乱、未整理的数据池，相比固定表示方法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动学习方法在处理混乱数据池时使用固定的无监督表示，这些表示可能无法捕捉与目标任务相关的重要信息，限制了方法的有效性。

Method: 提出两种学习任务驱动表示的策略：1）直接学习半监督表示；2）对初始无监督表示进行监督微调。两种方法都在主动学习过程中定期更新表示。

Result: 两种任务驱动表示方法都显著优于使用无监督或预训练表示的方法，在实证性能上有明显提升。

Conclusion: 在主动学习中定期更新任务驱动的表示是处理混乱数据池的有效策略，能够更好地捕捉与目标任务相关的信息。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了InvGNN-WM，一种基于图不变量的无触发器水印方法，用于保护图神经网络的知识产权，具有黑盒验证、低任务影响和高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN水印方法大多依赖后门触发器，这些触发器在常见的模型编辑下容易失效，并导致所有权模糊问题。

Method: 通过模型对图不变量的隐式感知来绑定所有权，使用轻量级头部预测归一化代数连通性，通过符号敏感解码器输出比特，并采用校准阈值控制误报率。

Result: 在多种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN-WM在保持清洁准确率的同时，水印准确率高于基于触发器和压缩的基线方法，在非结构化剪枝、微调和训练后量化下保持强健。

Conclusion: 该方法为GNN提供了不可感知性和鲁棒性保证，证明了精确移除是NP完全问题，为GNN知识产权保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在异构无线条件下基于SGD的空中联邦学习(OTA-FL)，提出了允许结构化模型偏差的新更新方法，揭示了偏差-方差权衡，并开发了基于统计CSI的非凸功率控制优化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OTA-FL设计在异构无线场景下受限于最弱设备，且主要针对凸目标函数，而现代AI模型多为高度非凸。本文旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 开发了允许时间不变结构化模型偏差的OTA-FL SGD更新方法，推导了有限时间平稳性边界，提出了基于连续凸逼近(SCA)的非凸联合功率控制优化算法。

Result: 在非凸图像分类任务上的实验表明，SCA设计通过优化偏差加速了收敛，并相比现有OTA-FL基线提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的OTA-FL方法在异构无线条件下有效平衡了偏差与方差，为处理非凸目标函数的OTA-FL提供了理论保证和实用算法。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

TL;DR: MLT是一种可逆的确定性技术，用于将高基数分类标识符编码为紧凑数值向量，通过模运算和可逆线性变换保持双射映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统哈希或独热编码方法无法保持双射映射，MLT旨在提供可逆且可控维度的编码方案。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，实现可逆的确定性编码，支持维度控制和计算可扩展性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上，MLT实现了与监督嵌入相当的预测性能，但参数更少、训练成本更低。

Conclusion: MLT是一种高效的可逆编码方法，适用于大规模分类标识符处理，已在PyPI和GitHub开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种地理基础模型嵌入源在预测马拉维15个常规健康项目指标方面的表现，发现多源GeoFM集成模型相比传统地理空间插值方法在87%的指标上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不完整的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法来提高可靠性。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，基于552个健康服务区域的数据（2021年1月-2023年5月），评估Google人口动态基础模型、Google AlphaEarth卫星影像和手机通话记录三种GeoFM嵌入源的预测性能，并与传统地理空间插值方法比较。

Result: 嵌入方法在15个指标中的13个（87%）优于基线地理统计方法。多源GeoFM集成模型表现最稳健，在人口密度、新HIV病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上获得较好的R2值，但在结核病和营养不良等数据稀缺的目标上预测效果差。

Conclusion: GeoFM嵌入在LMIC背景下为特定健康和人口结果提供了适度的预测改进，多源GeoFM集成是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究的动机源于两个关键因素：(i) 数据驱动学习方法在组合优化等领域尚未展现强大结果；(ii) 医学图像重建等科学应用中训练数据天然受限。

Method: 定义了无数据设置，并根据问题实例如何编码到神经网络上将其分为两类：架构无关方法和架构特定方法。讨论了dNN设置与零样本学习、单样本学习、优化中的提升和过参数化等相关概念的异同。

Result: 虽然多层感知机几十年前已用于解决线性规划问题，但这种方法最近因在组合优化、逆问题和偏微分方程等多样化应用中展现的潜力而受到越来越多的关注。

Conclusion: 无数据神经网络方法在训练数据受限或数据驱动方法效果不佳的场景中具有重要应用价值，为优化问题提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

TL;DR: 本文指出InfoNCE不能作为有效的互信息估计器，提出了InfoNCE-anchor改进方法，通过引入辅助锚点类实现准确MI估计，并建立了基于评分规则的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管InfoNCE在对比表示学习中广泛使用，但它与互信息的间接联系使其不能作为有效的MI估计器，需要开发更准确的MI估计方法。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类进行一致的密度比估计，提出InfoNCE-anchor方法，并使用适当评分规则进行框架泛化。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor显著减少了MI估计偏差，但在自监督表示学习中并未提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习的优势不在于准确的MI估计本身，而在于学习结构化的密度比。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Motivation: 解决约束优化问题微分在机器学习、控制和决策系统中的集成挑战，克服求解器专业化和接口不匹配问题。

Conclusion: 可微分优化可以作为实验、学习、校准和设计的常规工具，无需偏离标准JuMP建模实践，同时保留广泛的求解器生态系统访问。

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了INFEX框架，用于解决线性赌博机中探索频率不足的问题，通过在预定时间表上执行探索策略，其他时间采用贪婪策略，实现高效且计算友好的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两极分化：完全自适应探索方法在每个时间步都可能探索，在安全关键或成本高昂的领域不实用；纯粹贪婪策略需要严格的多样性假设才能成功。需要一种中间方案来平衡探索和利用。

Method: 引入INFEX框架，按照预定时间表执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪婪行动。这是一个通用模块化框架，可以无缝集成任何完全自适应的探索方法。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能实现与标准可证明高效算法相匹配的实例相关遗憾。实证评估证实了理论发现，显示出最先进的遗憾性能和运行时间改进。

Conclusion: INFEX是一个简单实用的框架，通过限制密集探索计算到不频繁的间隔，既能实现高效学习，又能提高计算效率，在安全关键和成本敏感的应用中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于离散时间生存分析的双重专家混合框架，结合特征编码器MoE和风险MoE，在乳腺癌数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性、个体特征和时间动态，现有方法难以灵活整合这些因素。

Method: 采用双重MoE框架：特征编码器MoE用于亚组感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入捕捉时间动态。

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖性C指数在测试集上提升高达0.04，与Consurv框架结合时获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 双重MoE框架能有效提升生存分析性能，灵活整合现有深度学习生存分析流程。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Motivation: 探究AI系统是否真正理解人类概念还是仅仅模仿表面模式，通过象棋这一结合人类创造力和精确战略概念的领域进行研究。

Method: 分析270M参数的transformer模型，创建首个Chess960数据集（240个专家标注位置，涵盖6个战略概念），通过随机起始位置消除开局理论影响，进行分层概念识别分析。

Result: 早期层对人类概念（如中心控制、马前哨）识别准确率达85%，深层降至50-65%；在Chess960测试中，概念识别率下降10-20%，显示模型依赖记忆模式而非抽象理解。

Conclusion: 当前架构存在根本矛盾：赢得游戏的表示与人类思维表示相背离，AI系统在优化性能时发展出"异类智能"，这对需要真正人机协作的创造性AI应用构成挑战。

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Conclusion: 符号回归性能在很大程度上可以从计算量预测，这些结果为训练下一代符号回归模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建能够自主演化几何和拓扑的完全动态"元学习器"奠定了坚实基础，在科学模型发现和鲁棒表示学习等领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Method: 系统综述方法，整合分析了2018年以来发表的72项专注于合成金融数据生成的研究。对合成的金融信息类型、使用的生成方法以及评估数据效用和隐私的策略进行分类。

Result: 研究发现基于GAN的方法在文献中占主导地位，特别是用于生成时间序列市场数据和表格信用数据。虽然几种创新技术显示出改善真实性和隐私保护的潜力，但研究中对隐私保护的严格评估明显不足。

Conclusion: 通过提供生成技术、应用和评估方法的综合概述，该综述突出了关键研究空白，并为未来开发稳健、保护隐私的金融领域合成数据解决方案提供了指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Nirvana模型，这是一种具有专门记忆机制、线性时间复杂度和测试时任务信息提取能力的专业化通用模型。通过任务感知记忆触发器和专门记忆更新器，模型能够根据任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，并在领域转换时动态适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM结构（包括Transformer、线性注意力和混合模型）缺乏由任务信息引导的专门记忆机制。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够在保持广泛能力的同时，在目标领域达到专家级性能的模型。

Method: 设计了任务感知记忆触发器（Trigger）和专门记忆更新器（Updater）。Trigger根据当前任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，将每个输入样本视为自监督微调任务；Updater在Trigger引导下动态记忆上下文。

Result: 在多种自然语言建模基准测试中，Nirvana取得了与现有LLM结构相当或更优的结果。在医学MRI任务中，Nirvana实现了比传统MRI模型和传统LLM骨干网络更高质量的MRI重建，并能生成准确的初步临床报告。

Conclusion: Nirvana通过专门的记忆机制和任务感知适应能力，在保持通用性的同时实现了特定领域的专家级性能，证明了专门记忆机制在专业化通用模型中的有效性。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的多阶段bug二分法方法，相比传统方法准确率提升38%，相比基线LLM方法提升60%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于补丁的二分法存在多个问题：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交信息、基于简单启发式规则缺乏漏洞逻辑分析

Method: 使用LLM构建多阶段流水线：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围

Result: 评估显示该方法比最先进解决方案准确率提升超过38%，多阶段流水线相比基线LLM二分法准确率提升60%

Conclusion: LLM能够突破现有解决方案的障碍，多阶段流水线对于准确识别bug引入提交至关重要

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在工业物流仓库中仅使用视觉数据识别个体不切实际的问题，克服现有方法在真实条件下可能失效的挑战。

Method: 使用深度学习模型预测轨迹与传感器测量的对应概率和可靠性，然后基于这些预测值进行时间上的匹配。

Result: 在真实仓库操作数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CorVS方法能够有效应用于真实世界场景中的人员识别。

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习评估方法基于测试集上的平均损失，这在地球天气和气候预测中忽视了人类发展和地理分布的不均匀性，无法反映模型在不同区域的真实表现。

Method: 开发SAFE工具包，整合多种数据域，按领土、全球子区域、收入水平和土地覆盖等属性对地理网格点进行分层，分析每个属性层级的模型性能。

Result: 对多个最先进的AI天气预测模型进行基准测试，发现所有模型在所有属性上都存在预测技能的不均衡性，建立了基于不同提前期和气候变量的模型预测公平性基准。

Conclusion: 通过超越全局平均指标，首次能够回答模型在哪些区域表现最佳或最差，以及哪些模型最公平的问题，为相关研究提供了新的评估维度。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

TL;DR: 提出LTE方法，通过让LLM从自身生成的错误答案中学习来解决RLVR中的探索停滞问题，无需外部专家指导


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法受限于LLM初始能力，容易陷入探索停滞，无法解决更多训练问题。现有解决方案需要外部专家指导但可用性有限

Method: LTE方法提示LLM关注之前自己生成的错误答案和过长响应问题，通过试错学习来增强推理能力

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE比GRPO方法平均提升6.38%的Pass@1和9.00%的Pass@k，成功缓解了探索停滞问题

Conclusion: LTE有效增强了训练过程中的利用和探索能力，无需外部指导即可显著提升LLM的推理性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WiFi CSI活动识别在边缘设备部署中因环境和硬件条件变化导致的域偏移问题，实现隐私保护的无设备感知。

Method: 采用跨模态师生架构，使用高精度YOLO视觉模型作为动态监督信号，为CSI数据流提供实时活动标签，在线微调轻量级CSI活动识别模型STAR。

Result: 在未校准硬件上，基线STAR模型准确率从93.52%降至49.14%，经过一次视觉引导自适应循环后，准确率恢复至81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR能够在隐私敏感的物联网环境中实现动态、自监督的模型自适应，为边缘CSI感知建立了可扩展的长期自主活动识别范式。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

Method: 通过分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号增强原始数据，采用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制过滤噪声对齐信号。

Result: MolBridge在多个分子基准测试中优于现有最先进基线，有效捕捉细粒度对应关系。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time

Method: 将CPRA问题建模为势博弈，证明势函数与最优目标无间隙，并设计GSTRL框架捕捉系统时空动态。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明GSTRL具有优越性能。

Conclusion: CPRA问题具有理论和实践意义，GSTRL框架能有效解决这一NP难问题。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SGD-IE方法通过求和每轮替代项来近似留一影响，但忽略了跨轮复合效应，导致对关键样本的错误排序。

Method: ACC-SGD-IE是一种轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态。

Result: 在Adult、20 Newsgroups和MNIST数据集上的实验表明，ACC-SGD-IE在干净和污染数据、凸和非凸训练下都能产生更准确的影响估计。使用ACC-SGD-IE清洗的数据训练的模型优于使用SGD-IE清洗的模型。

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE通过考虑跨训练周期的复合效应，提供了更可靠的样本影响估计，在数据清洗等下游任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于微调大语言模型需要高昂的计算成本，因此测试时对齐方法受到关注。

Method: 基于随机控制输入的采样模型预测控制，在预对数（倒数第二层输出）上应用高斯扰动，通过重要性采样获得最优扰动均值。

Result: AISP在使用样本数量方面的奖励优于最佳N采样，并且比其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在不需要微调的情况下提升大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于归纳方法的机器遗忘解决方案，通过反转最后训练序列实现遗忘，无需访问原始数据集或模型，具有模块化、模型无关的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法在现实部署中面临可扩展性问题，需要完全访问原始数据集和模型，难以实用化。

Method: 将分类训练视为顺序学习过程，通过添加投影-重分布层实现遗忘，作为输出过滤器集成到现有分类流程中。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10/100、Covertype）上实验表明，输出与完全重训练模型相似，同时大幅降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时，展示了适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，为机器遗忘提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

### [218] [Angular Steering: Behavior Control via Rotation in Activation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26243)
*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Angular Steering的新方法，通过旋转激活向量在固定二维子空间内实现行为调控，相比现有方法更灵活稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的行为调控方法（如向量加法和方向消融）局限于二维子空间，对参数选择敏感且可能影响无关特征，需要更灵活稳定的调控方法。

Method: 将行为调控建模为几何旋转，在固定二维子空间内旋转激活向量朝向或远离目标行为方向，并提出了自适应变体仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活。

Result: 在多个模型系列和规模上的实验表明，Angular Steering实现了鲁棒的行为控制，同时保持了通用语言建模性能，相比先前方法具有更好的灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Angular Steering为行为调控提供了一个统一的几何旋转框架，简化了参数选择，保持了模型稳定性，是安全可靠AI部署的有效方法。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外训练即可计算生成模型插值路径的新方法，该方法在数据分布约束下寻找高概率的过渡路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数生成模型缺乏对插值的理论定义，需要限制模型或数据维度的假设，这限制了插值的可控生成和模型检查能力。

Method: 开发了一种通用插值方案，针对与不同度量和概率分布兼容的似然过渡路径，类似于在合适数据分布约束下的测地线，并推导了计算这些曲线的新算法。

Result: 理论上证明该方法在局部可视为特定黎曼度量下的测地线；定量实验显示该方法在多种模型和数据集上比基线方法更频繁地穿越高密度区域。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成模型提供了一种无需训练的理论严谨的插值方案，能够更好地探索数据分布的高概率区域。

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了IMG算法，在扩散模型推理时进行多目标优化，通过加权重采样生成满足多个目标的样本，显著提高了超体积指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将扩散模型视为黑盒优化器，忽略了扩散生成过程中的内部分布转换，限制了效率。

Method: 在扩散生成过程中根据期望聚合多目标值进行加权重采样，确保生成的样本符合期望的多目标玻尔兹曼分布。

Result: 在分子生成任务中，IMG仅需单次生成即可实现比基线算法（需要数百次扩散生成）显著更高的超体积。

Conclusion: IMG算法可视为优化的扩散过程，能够集成到现有方法中进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

TL;DR: 该论文研究离线偏好学习中的聚类问题，提出两种算法解决多用户偏好差异和数据不平衡的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的偏好学习涉及具有不同偏好的用户，且离线数据通常不平衡，这带来了两个核心挑战：识别用户相似性以有效聚合数据，以及处理某些偏好维度数据不足的问题。

Method: 提出Off-C²PL算法用于纯离线设置，通过理论分析捕捉样本噪声与偏差的权衡；扩展为A²-Off-C²PL算法，在主动数据增强设置中选择最不具信息量的样本进行补充。

Result: 理论分析提供了次优性界限，证明主动收集的样本比离线样本更有效，并在合成和真实数据集上验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效处理多用户偏好差异和离线数据不平衡问题，通过聚类和主动学习策略提高了偏好学习的性能。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，解释了CLIP在组合推理方面的脆弱性，揭示了组合不可识别性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在跨模态泛化方面表现优异，但在组合推理（对象、属性、关系）方面表现不佳，现有因果解释通常将文本建模为单一向量，无法解释提示敏感性和硬负例失败等核心现象。

Method: 提出了基于语言token序列结构化因果模型的token感知因果表示学习框架，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜在变量。

Result: token粒度分析首次从原理上解释了CLIP的组合脆弱性：组合不可识别性。存在伪最优文本编码器，虽然实现完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感，无法区分正确标题和硬负例。

Conclusion: 分析通过模态间隙将语言侧不可识别性与视觉侧失败联系起来，展示了迭代组合操作如何加剧难度，为改进负例挖掘策略提供了动机。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了增量式Adam优化器在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差，发现其与全批次Adam不同，可能收敛到ℓ₂-最大间隔分类器，而Signum优化器在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam是深度学习中最常用的优化器，但其理论理解有限。先前分析表明Adam偏向ℓ∞-几何解，但这些结果仅限于全批次情况。本文旨在研究增量式Adam在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差。

Method: 构建结构化数据集证明增量式Adam收敛到ℓ₂-最大间隔分类器；开发代理算法捕捉β₂→1时增量式Adam的极限行为；通过数据依赖的双重定点公式表征收敛方向；证明Signum在任意批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器。

Result: 增量式Adam的隐式偏差偏离全批次行为，可能收敛到ℓ₂-最大间隔分类器；Signum在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器；Adam的隐式偏差关键取决于批次方案和数据集。

Conclusion: Adam的隐式偏差关键取决于批次方案和数据集，而Signum保持不变。这为理解不同优化器的收敛行为提供了重要理论洞见。

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据无关的持续学习方法，通过模型反演生成伪数据来避免存储历史数据，解决了模型反演中的特征漂移和计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习需要存储和重放历史数据，但在隐私安全限制下不可行。数据无关的持续学习旨在不访问先前数据的情况下更新模型。

Method: 提出分层模型反演(PMI)提高计算效率，通过高斯分布和对比学习建模类特征来缓解特征漂移，结合语义感知投影特征生成伪图像。

Result: 该方法在多个持续学习设置中表现出强大的有效性和兼容性，显著减少了模型反演所需的迭代次数。

Conclusion: 提出的PMI和特征建模方法能够有效实现数据无关的持续学习，特别适用于大型预训练模型如CLIP，解决了特征漂移和计算效率问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子退火在SVM训练中的应用潜力，探索量子比特数量（对应双权重离散化水平）如何影响模型性能，并与经典方法进行比较。

Method: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行优化，比较不同比特精度编码（如1比特/参数）的性能，并与经典LIBSVM求解器对比。

Result: 即使低精度QUBO编码（如1比特/参数）也能获得有竞争力甚至更优的准确率；增加比特深度虽然允许更大的正则化参数，但并不总能改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 选择合适的支持向量可能比精确的权重更重要；虽然当前硬件限制了可求解QUBO的规模，但研究结果显示了量子退火在SVM训练中的潜力，随着量子设备的发展将有更大应用空间。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合扩散模型和退火Langevin动力学的方法，在仅需分数误差的L4界条件下，实现了后验采样的多项式时间算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后验采样在图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务中具有重要应用，但近似后验采样在计算上通常是难解的。现有方法如Langevin动力学对分数估计误差敏感，需要更强的误差界条件。

Method: 针对局部或全局对数凹分布，将扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学相结合，利用扩散模型在无条件设置下的优势，仅需较弱的分数误差L4界。

Result: 证明了该方法在多项式时间内实现条件采样，仅需要分数误差的L4界，相比传统Langevin动力学所需的次指数误差界要求更宽松。

Conclusion: 该方法为后验采样提供了一个计算可行的解决方案，放宽了对分数估计精度的要求，在保持多项式时间复杂度的同时提高了实用性。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了前沿LLM公司推出的Agent Skills框架存在严重安全漏洞，攻击者可以通过简单的提示注入技术窃取敏感数据，并能绕过系统级防护机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Agent Skills框架为LLM提供了持续学习能力，但其安全性尚未得到充分验证。作者旨在揭示该框架在实际应用中的安全风险。

Method: 通过在长Agent Skill文件和引用脚本中隐藏恶意指令，演示如何窃取敏感数据，并展示如何利用"不再询问"选项绕过系统防护。

Result: 成功证明了Agent Skills框架存在根本性安全漏洞，攻击者可以轻易实施提示注入攻击，窃取内部文件和密码等敏感信息。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM能力不断提升，前沿LLM在实际场景中仍然容易受到简单提示注入攻击，安全防护机制存在明显缺陷。

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法虽然可以施加结构约束，但仍可能得出与已知因果效应相矛盾的结论。需要一种能直接约束因果效应大小和方向的方法，确保模型与已有科学发现一致。

Method: 提出干预约束概念，为线性因果模型设计量化总因果效应的度量，将其表述为约束优化问题，采用两阶段约束优化方法求解。

Conclusion: 干预约束为因果发现提供了有效的高层次知识整合框架，使模型更具可解释性，并为发现新因果关系提供了成本效益更高的途径。

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnifiedFL是一个动态联邦学习框架，通过图神经网络统一表示异构架构，解决客户端架构差异、数据分布不均和测试域不同的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法仅支持同一模型族的变体，无法处理客户端使用完全不同网络类型（如CNN、GNN、MLP）的情况，且忽视了域断裂问题，导致模型泛化能力差。

Method: 将异构本地网络表示为有向模型图中的节点和边，使用共享GNN进行优化；引入距离驱动聚类和两层级聚合策略平衡收敛与多样性。

Result: 在MedMNIST分类和海马体分割基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UnifiedFL能够有效处理联邦学习中的架构异构性、统计异构性和域断裂问题，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Motivation: 金融预测中大型神经网络模型的不透明性给信任和监管合规带来挑战，需要开发可解释和可靠的AI方法。

Method: 1. Time-LLM时间序列基础模型使用提示避免错误方向预测；2. 基础模型与可靠性估计器结合过滤不可靠预测；3. 符号推理编码领域规则提供透明解释。

Conclusion: 通过整合预测性能与可靠性估计和基于规则的推理，该框架推进了透明可审计的金融AI系统发展。

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发基于Flow Matching的生成式AI模型FM-Cast，用于高效、准确的平流层环流时空演变的概率预报，在18次主要SSW事件中表现优异，计算效率远超传统数值天气预报系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平流层突然增温(SSW)是次季节可预报性的关键来源和极端冬季天气的主要驱动因素，但传统数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在局限，而数据驱动方法在复杂三维SSW动力学特别是概率预报方面的应用仍待探索。

Method: 采用基于Flow Matching的生成式AI模型FM-Cast，构建平流层环流时空演变的概率预报系统，通过理想化实验分析SSW可预报性与物理驱动因素的关系。

Result: 在1998-2024年的18次主要SSW事件中，FM-Cast能够提前20天准确预报10次事件的爆发、强度和形态，集合准确率超过50%，性能达到或超过领先的NWP系统，且在消费级GPU上仅需2分钟完成50成员、30天的预报。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了计算高效的平流层异常概率预报范式，展示了生成式AI在加深大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力，揭示了SSW可预报性与其物理驱动因素的根本联系。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,
and effectiveness with small datasets.
  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling
strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for
multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

TL;DR: CoLA-World提出了一种联合训练潜在动作模型和世界模型的新范式，通过预热阶段对齐表示，解决了联合学习中的表示坍塌问题，实现了比传统两阶段方法更好的视频模拟质量和视觉规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的两阶段方法（分别训练潜在动作模型和世界模型）存在训练冗余且限制了协同适应潜力。直接联合训练虽然概念简单但容易导致表示坍塌。

Method: 提出CoLA-World，通过关键的预热阶段有效对齐从零开始的潜在动作模型与预训练世界模型的表示，然后进行联合训练，实现协同进化。

Result: 在视频模拟质量和下游视觉规划任务中，CoLA-World匹配或超越了先前的两阶段方法。

Conclusion: CoLA-World为领域建立了一个稳健高效的新范式，通过联合训练实现了潜在动作模型与世界模型的协同进化。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Conclusion: CFKD-AFN能有效利用低保真数据增强高保真数据预测性能，并可扩展为可解释变体支持临床决策

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图压缩方法在原始图数据被污染时性能显著下降，而现有的鲁棒图学习技术效果有限。图压缩本质上是一个降低内在维度的过程，这一特性使其容易受到对抗性扰动的影响。

Method: 采用图数据流形的几何视角，提出了MRGC框架，包含三个图数据流形学习模块，引导压缩图位于平滑、低维的流形上，具有最小的类别模糊性。

Result: 大量实验表明，MRGC在各种攻击场景下都表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过流形约束方法可以有效提升图压缩的鲁棒性，在对抗攻击下保持分类复杂度降低的能力。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过强化学习进行适配时，生成阶段通常消耗超过75%的训练时间。推测解码在服务系统中能加速自回归生成，但其在强化学习训练中的行为尚未充分探索，存在三个关键差距阻碍其直接集成。

Method: 提出ReSpec系统，包含三个互补机制：动态调整推测解码配置、通过知识蒸馏演进草稿模型、按rollout奖励加权更新。

Result: 在Qwen模型（3B-14B）上，ReSpec实现了高达4.5倍的加速，同时保持了奖励收敛和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于强化学习的高效LLM适配提供了一个实用的解决方案，成功解决了推测解码在RL训练中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

Motivation: 可穿戴设备的心电图监测对心血管疾病早期检测有重要意义，但在资源受限环境中，标准深度学习模型面临分布外数据的可靠性挑战。OOD输入会导致错误的高置信度预测，危及患者安全。现有方法要么忽略计算约束，要么单独处理噪声和未见类别。

Result: 在PTB-XL和BUT QDB数据集上的评估显示，Deep SVDD在检测OOD心血管疾病类别和噪声损坏信号方面始终达到检测性能和效率的最佳平衡。在实际部署模拟中，集成优化的Deep SVDD过滤器可将诊断分类器的准确率比仅使用分类器的基线提高21个百分点。

Conclusion: 优化的无监督异常检测过滤器能够保护自动心电图分析，使可穿戴设备上的连续心血管监测更安全可靠。Deep SVDD是实现这一目标的有效方法。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理延迟是LLM大规模部署的关键瓶颈，现有推测解码方法依赖二元草案-验证框架且缺乏严格理论支撑。

Conclusion: 多基础推测解码框架在保持原始输出分布的同时显著加速推理，为超越二元方法提供了理论基础和实践方案。

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Motivation: 扩展HOHL的理论基础，超越先前仅限于几何设置的渐近一致性分析，证明其在更广泛学习场景中的有效性。

Method: 证明截断HOHL的一致性，推导HOHL作为正则化器在完全监督学习中的显式收敛率，并在主动学习和非几何结构数据集上进行实证评估。

Result: 建立了截断HOHL的理论一致性，获得了显式收敛率，实证结果显示HOHL在主动学习和非几何结构数据集中表现优异。

Conclusion: HOHL具有跨多样化学习设置的通用性和鲁棒性，为高阶超图学习提供了更坚实的理论基础和实证支持。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

### [246] [A Three-Stage Bayesian Transfer Learning Framework to Improve Predictions in Data-Scarce Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26541)
*Aidan Furlong,Robert Salko,Xingang Zhao,Xu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种三阶段贝叶斯域对抗神经网络（staged B-DANN），通过参数迁移和共享潜在空间适应，在存在大域偏移的情况下提高迁移学习性能，并提供不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络需要大量高质量数据，但实验数据往往稀疏、有噪声或不足。传统参数迁移方法在大域偏移下性能下降，而域对抗神经网络虽然能处理域偏移但训练不稳定且缺乏不确定性量化。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）在源域训练确定性特征提取器；2）使用DANN对抗性精炼特征提取器；3）在适应的特征提取器上构建贝叶斯神经网络，在目标域上进行微调以处理条件偏移并提供校准的不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成基准测试中显著优于标准迁移技术，在矩形通道临界热通量预测任务中提高了预测精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: staged B-DANN方法能改善预测准确性和泛化能力，有望帮助核工程等其他领域。

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了几何正则化世界模型(GRWM)，通过强制自然感官轨迹上的连续点在潜在表示空间中保持接近，显著改善了潜在表示质量，从而在确定性3D环境中实现了更准确和稳定的长期预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型在长期预测中表现脆弱，主要原因是表示质量不足：高维的外部感知输入以及有损或纠缠的潜在表示使得动态学习变得困难。本文旨在通过改进表示学习来显著提升世界模型的性能。

Method: 提出几何正则化世界模型(GRWM)，该方法强制自然感官轨迹上的连续点在潜在表示空间中保持几何接近性，从而学习与真实环境拓扑对齐的潜在表示。该方法具有即插即用、最小架构修改、与轨迹长度可扩展以及与多种潜在生成主干兼容的特点。

Result: 在确定性3D环境和长期预测任务中，GRWM显著提高了推演保真度和稳定性。分析表明其优势源于学习具有优越几何结构的潜在流形。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效途径，能够在无需扩大动态模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度学习模型中捷径学习在层级间的分布情况，发现捷径学习并非集中在特定层，而是分布在整个网络中。浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要忘记核心特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径（在训练中表现良好但泛化能力差的虚假规则）对深度学习可靠性构成重大挑战，但其对特征表示的影响研究不足，阻碍了设计原则性捷径缓解方法。

Method: 通过新颖的实验设计量化由捷径诱导偏斜导致的精度退化在各层的贡献度，采用反事实训练方法在干净和偏斜数据集上训练，并在CIFAR-10、Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上使用VGG、ResNet、DeiT和ConvNeXt架构进行研究。

Result: 发现捷径学习不局限于特定层，而是分布在整个网络中：浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要忘记在干净数据上具有预测性的核心特征。分析了定位差异及其主要变化轴。

Conclusion: 层级捷径缓解策略分析表明设计通用方法很困难，支持采用数据集和架构特定的方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Conclusion: 局部校准方法有效解决了多分类校准中的邻近偏差问题，为高风险应用提供了更可靠的校准解决方案。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Bernstein基参数化和Wasserstein距离最小化的新方法，用于分布回归问题，在保持几何准确性的同时提供计算实用性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布回归方法要么忽略概率空间的几何结构，要么计算成本高昂，需要一种兼顾几何准确性和计算效率的解决方案。

Method: 使用Bernstein多项式构造高斯分量的均值和协方差函数，将条件分布建模为平滑概率轨迹，通过最小化预测高斯分布与经验数据之间的平方Wasserstein距离来训练模型。

Result: 在复杂轨迹的合成数据集上，该方法在Wasserstein距离、能量距离和RMSE指标上表现出有竞争力的逼近质量，特别是在非线性明显的情况下，轨迹平滑度优于或与替代方法相当，且对数据结构变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在几何准确性、计算实用性和可解释性之间取得了平衡，未来研究方向包括扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算，以及适应高维数据建模更复杂结构。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Motivation: 许多现实系统（如单细胞RNA中的细胞周期）表现出非梯度、周期性行为，而当前基于最小作用原理的方法只能建模梯度场动态，无法捕捉这些复杂行为。

Method: 设计并求解具有非零漂移参考过程的Schrödinger桥问题，利用推断的速度和种群快照数据构建参考过程，从而学习非梯度场动态。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

*Amir Reza Mirzaei,Yuqiao Wen,Yanshuai Cao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAQuant是一种针对LoRA适配器的混合精度后训练量化方法，通过SVD重参数化将重要信息集中在特定行列，实现重要组件高精度量化，其余部分超低比特量化，显著降低存储成本同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA已成为大语言模型参数高效微调的流行技术，但在实际场景中多个适配器同时加载时，虽然单个适配器轻量，但聚合成本巨大，需要解决存储效率问题。

Method: 提出LoRAQuant方法：1）使用SVD对每个适配器进行重参数化，将最重要信息集中在特定行列；2）对重要组件采用高精度量化，其余部分采用超低比特量化；3）在LLaMA 2-7B/13B和Mistral 7B模型上进行数学推理、编程和摘要任务的全面实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，LoRAQuant相比其他量化方法使用显著更低的比特数，但实现了相当甚至更高的性能表现。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant通过混合精度量化策略，有效解决了多适配器场景下的存储效率问题，在显著降低比特数的同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可逆神经网络在逆问题中具有固有稳定性和可解释性，但现有的贝叶斯视角优化策略各有局限性，需要新的正则化方法来恢复经典贝叶斯点估计器的特性。

Method: 引入并分析两种网络训练正则化项：第一种连接后验均值，第二种类似MAP估计器。通过理论分析表征每个损失如何影响学习的前向算子及其逆重建映射。

Conclusion: 正则化项确实能够使可逆神经网络在重建中恢复经典贝叶斯点估计器的特性，为逆问题提供了稳定且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Motivation: 传统延迟算法训练需要查询所有专家，成本过高，违背了延迟的核心目标——限制不必要的专家使用

Method: 提出两种算法：两阶段和单阶段多专家延迟设置，选择性查询部分专家；建立理论保证包括泛化边界和标签复杂度分析

Result: 在多个领域验证，算法显著降低训练成本而不牺牲预测准确性

Conclusion: 预算感知延迟算法具有实际价值，能有效平衡成本与预测性能

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ARC-Top-K压缩器，通过轻量级梯度草图对齐节点间的稀疏模式，实现无需索引的All-Reduce操作，在保持全局重要信息的同时显著减少通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模分布式机器学习中的通信瓶颈问题，现有梯度压缩方法存在局限性：Rand-K丢弃结构信息且实际性能差，Top-K保留信息但失去压缩特性且需要昂贵的All-Gather操作。

Method: 设计All-Reduce兼容的Top-K压缩器，使用轻量级梯度草图对齐跨节点的稀疏模式，结合动量误差反馈(EF21M)算法。

Result: ARC-Top-K在理论上具有压缩特性，与EF21M结合时实现线性加速和更快的收敛速度。实验显示其精度与Top-K相当，同时将训练时间减少高达60.7%。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

Motivation: 机器遗忘算法通常只是近似方法，需要通过实证评估性能。现有实践从同一训练模型多次运行算法进行评估，但这种方法可能产生非代表性结果。

Method: 通过分析机器遗忘算法对不同模型训练种子的敏感性，证明仅从单一训练模型评估会导致结果偏差。

Result: 研究发现某些机器遗忘方法对模型训练时的随机种子选择高度敏感，从同一模型多次运行会得到非代表性结果。

Conclusion: 建议在实证比较机器遗忘算法时，应考虑不同模型训练种子的变异性，以获得更准确的性能评估。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Motivation: 现有差分隐私协方差矩阵估计方法在不同数据集规模下存在误差界不最优的问题，需要一种统一的机制在各种范数下都能达到信息理论最优误差。

Method: 使用简单的扰动机制，对于大数据集直接应用，对于小数据集将输出投影到适当半径的核范数球上。

Result: 在大数据集(n≥d²/ε)上达到所有p-Schatten范数的最优误差，特别是首次在谱范数下达到纯差分隐私的最优误差；在小数据集上改进Frobenius范数误差界。

Conclusion: 该机制为差分隐私协方差估计提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，在各种数据集规模下都能达到最优或改进的误差保证。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上将参数化内存视为实体间共现的暴力查找，但作者发现这种关联视图无法解释某些Transformer推理现象，需要探索内存的几何表示方式。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理实例，对比关联视图与几何视图，并借鉴Node2Vec分析几何结构的光谱偏差来源。

Result: 发现Transformer能够合成原子事实的几何结构，编码包括非共现实体在内的全局关系，将复杂组合推理简化为易学的几何任务。

Conclusion: 参数化内存的几何视图应取代默认的关联直觉，这对知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域具有重要启示意义。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Method: STaMP量化在序列维度应用线性变换，利用语言和视觉数据的强局部相关性，并在每个中间激活中保留少量高精度token

Result: 在最近的LVM和LLM架构上评估，STaMP显著改善了低比特激活量化，并与现有的激活和权重量化方法互补

Conclusion: STaMP是一种有效的量化策略，能够保持模型精度同时降低平均激活位宽

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Conclusion: 提出的采样方法能够有效平衡影响函数估计的准确性和计算效率，为黑盒模型的可解释性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 解决RL微调LLM时因数值不匹配导致的不稳定性问题，发现问题的根本原因在于浮点精度本身而非算法或工程调整。

Method: 将广泛采用的BF16精度改为FP16精度，这种改变简单易行，只需几行代码修改，无需改变模型架构或学习算法。

Result: 使用FP16能带来更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在多样化任务、算法和框架中展现出更强的性能表现。

Conclusion: FP16比BF16更适合RL微调LLM，建议重新考虑RL微调中的精度权衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型学习PCG生成的伪随机序列的能力，PCG相比LCG引入了额外的位操作复杂度，测试模型在超越传统攻击难度的任务中的表现。

Method: 使用Transformer模型在上下文中预测PCG序列，实验规模达到模数2^22、5000万参数和50亿token数据集，分析模型在不同模数下的学习行为和表示结构。

Result: 模型能够成功预测未见过的PCG序列，即使输出截断为单个比特。发现缩放规律：预测所需序列长度∝√m。对于大模数需要课程学习策略。嵌入层出现按位旋转不变性的聚类现象。

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习复杂的PCG伪随机序列，揭示了模型从较小模数向较大模数表示迁移的能力，证明了课程学习在大模数学习中的必要性。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Motivation: 先前研究发现当用户被场景元素分散注意力时，对增益值的敏感度降低，但这种对检测阈值的影响尚未被定量测量。

Method: 通过在用户视野内放置干扰物，当用户注意力被干扰物吸引时应用更大的平移增益。增益调整幅度取决于用户与干扰物的互动程度，确保转向过程平滑自然。

Result: 实验结果显示，在虚拟环境中引入干扰物显著提高了用户的平移增益阈值。模拟器疾病问卷和存在感问卷评估表明该方法保持了用户舒适度和接受度。

Conclusion: 该方法支持转向行走系统的有效性，能够在保持用户舒适的同时提高转向效率。

Abstract: Redirected walking utilizes gain adjustments within perceptual thresholds to
allow natural navigation in large scale virtual environments within confined
physical environments. Previous research has found that when users are
distracted by some scene elements, they are less sensitive to gain values.
However, the effects on detection thresholds have not been quantitatively
measured. In this paper, we present a novel method that dynamically adjusts
translation gain by leveraging visual distractors. We place distractors within
the user's field of view and apply a larger translation gain when their
attention is drawn to them. Because the magnitude of gain adjustment depends on
the user's level of engagement with the distractors, the redirection process
remains smooth and unobtrusive. To evaluate our method, we developed a task
oriented virtual environment for a user study. Results show that introducing
distractors in the virtual environment significantly raises users' translation
gain thresholds. Furthermore, assessments using the Simulator Sickness
Questionnaire and Igroup Presence Questionnaire indicate that the method
maintains user comfort and acceptance, supporting its effectiveness for RDW
systems.

TL;DR: 比较三种AR导航辅助工具在户外寻物任务中的效果，发现所有导航工具都能提升搜索性能，其中世界内箭头最受用户青睐，但用户对物理环境的注意力会减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究头戴式AR设备作为智能手机替代品时，不同导航辅助工具对用户搜索性能和环境感知的影响。

Method: 在户外环境中进行用户研究(n=24)，比较屏幕指南针、屏幕雷达和世界内垂直箭头三种导航辅助工具，分析搜索性能、移动、眼动、调查反馈和物体回忆。

Result: 所有导航辅助工具相比控制组都能提升搜索性能，世界内箭头最受用户偏好；用户对物理物体的回忆少于虚拟物体，表明物理环境注意力降低。

Conclusion: AR导航辅助工具能提升搜索任务性能，但可能导致用户减少对物理环境的关注，这可能带来不良副作用。

Abstract: Head-worn augmented reality (AR) is a hotly pursued and increasingly feasible
contender paradigm for replacing or complementing smartphones and watches for
continual information consumption. Here, we compare three different AR
navigation aids (on-screen compass, on-screen radar and in-world vertical
arrows) in a wide-area outdoor user study (n=24) where participants search for
hidden virtual target items amongst physical and virtual objects. We analyzed
participants' search task performance, movements, eye-gaze, survey responses
and object recall. There were two key findings. First, all navigational aids
enhanced search performance relative to a control condition, with some benefit
and strongest user preference for in-world arrows. Second, users recalled fewer
physical objects than virtual objects in the environment, suggesting reduced
awareness of the physical environment. Together, these findings suggest that
while navigational aids presented in AR can enhance search task performance,
users may pay less attention to the physical environment, which could have
undesirable side-effects.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了人机协作在构建机器学习代理目标变量时的两种策略：相关性优先（人类主导）和性能优先（机器主导），发现性能优先策略能加速迭代但可能导致目标错位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测建模在实践中常因问题表述不当而失败，特别是在预测目标是抽象概念时，需要定义合适的代理变量。这个过程需要领域专家和数据科学家的协作，而人机协作可以加速迭代同时保持人类判断。

Method: 通过受控用户研究（N=20）比较两种人机协作策略：1）相关性优先：人类选择相关代理；2）性能优先：机器基于预测性能推荐代理。

Result: 性能优先策略促进了更快的迭代和决策，但也使用户偏向于性能良好但与应用目标不一致的代理变量。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人机协作在操作化机器学习目标变量时的机遇和风险，为未来研究提供了缓解风险的见解。

Abstract: Predictive modeling has the potential to enhance human decision-making.
However, many predictive models fail in practice due to problematic problem
formulation in cases where the prediction target is an abstract concept or
construct and practitioners need to define an appropriate target variable as a
proxy to operationalize the construct of interest. The choice of an appropriate
proxy target variable is rarely self-evident in practice, requiring both domain
knowledge and iterative data modeling. This process is inherently
collaborative, involving both domain experts and data scientists. In this work,
we explore how human-machine teaming can support this process by accelerating
iterations while preserving human judgment. We study the impact of two
human-machine teaming strategies on proxy construction: 1) relevance-first:
humans leading the process by selecting relevant proxies, and 2)
performance-first: machines leading the process by recommending proxies based
on predictive performance. Based on a controlled user study of a proxy
construction task (N = 20), we show that the performance-first strategy
facilitated faster iterations and decision-making, but also biased users
towards well-performing proxies that are misaligned with the application goal.
Our study highlights the opportunities and risks of human-machine teaming in
operationalizing machine learning target variables, yielding insights for
future research to explore the opportunities and mitigate the risks.

Motivation: 增强现实作为移动信息消费的主要模式，但虚拟注释的感知需求对用户效能和安全的影响尚未被充分理解。

Method: 参与者沿预定路径行走，搜索物理或虚拟物品，体验两种注释密度水平，以及自由行走或强制速度路径引导两种条件。

Result: 注释密度影响行为表现，降低对环境中不常见物体的意识；搜索任务表现和事后回忆显示对物理和虚拟物体的注意力分配存在差异。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，为移动使用的AR应用设计提出了考虑因素。

Abstract: Augmented reality is projected to be a primary mode of information
consumption on the go, seamlessly integrating virtual content into the physical
world. However, the potential perceptual demands of viewing virtual annotations
while navigating a physical environment could impact user efficacy and safety,
and the implications of these demands are not well understood. Here, we
investigate the impact of virtual path guidance and augmentation density
(visual clutter) on search performance and memory. Participants walked along a
predefined path, searching for physical or virtual items. They experienced two
levels of augmentation density, and either walked freely or with enforced speed
and path guidance. Augmentation density impacted behavior and reduced awareness
of uncommon objects in the environment. Analysis of search task performance and
post-experiment item recall revealed differing attention to physical and
virtual objects. On the basis of these findings we outline considerations for
AR apps designed for use on the go.

Motivation: 理解盲人和低视力乘客在自动驾驶汽车中的具体交互需求，以提升他们的出行体验和尊严。

Method: 进行了6次实地和实验室焦点小组研究，涉及16名参与者，让他们体验真实驾驶条件，并进行主题分析。

Result: 参与者对自动驾驶汽车表现出高度初始信任，但需要分层信息来培养信任；偏好语音交互而非触觉反馈；强调尊重性交互设计的重要性。

Conclusion: 自动驾驶汽车设计需要采用尊严框架，通过分层信息传递和语音交互来满足盲人和低视力用户的需求，同时维护他们的尊严。

Abstract: Fully automated vehicles (FAVs) hold promise for enhancing the mobility of
blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. To understand the situated interaction
needs of BLV passengers, we conducted six on-road, and in-lab focus groups with
16 participants, immersing them in real-world driving conditions. Our thematic
analysis reveals that BLV participants express a high initial 'faith' in FAVs,
but require layered, value-sensitive information during the ride to cultivate
trust. The participants' modality preference for voice suggests re-evaluating
the role of haptics for BLV users in FAVs. Our findings show the importance of
a respectful interaction design in FAVs that both address BLV users' mobility
challenges and uphold their dignity. While others have advocated for a dignity
lens, our contribution lies in grounding this framework in empirical findings
and unpacking what it means to design for dignity in the context of FAVs.

Result: 初步反馈表明FractalBrain有促进正念和增强注意力的潜力。

Conclusion: FractalBrain系统展示了结合VR和EEG技术来辅助正念练习的可能性，为初学者提供了更易上手的正念体验。

Abstract: Mindfulness has been studied and practiced in enhancing psychological
well-being while reducing neuroticism and psychopathological indicators.
However, practicing mindfulness with continuous attention is challenging,
especially for beginners. In the proposed system, FractalBrain, we utilize an
interactive audiovisual fractal with a geometric repetitive pattern that has
been demonstrated to induce meditative effects. FractalBrain presents an
experience combining a surreal virtual reality (VR) program with an
electroencephalogram (EEG) interface. While viewing an ever-changing
fractal-inspired artwork in an immersive environment, the user's EEG stream is
analyzed and mapped into VR. These EEG data adaptively manipulates the
audiovisual parameters in real-time, generating a distinct experience for each
user. The pilot feedback suggests the potential of the FractalBrain to
facilitate mindfulness and enhance attention.

TL;DR: 提出了Interaction-Augmented Instruction (IAI)模型，这是一个实体关系图，用于形式化交互与文本提示的组合如何增强人类与生成式AI的通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本提示虽然方便，但难以传达细粒度和引用意图。结合精确的GUI交互（如刷选和点击）是一个有前景的解决方案，但缺乏形式化模型来建模提示与交互之间的协同设计。

Method: 通过迭代和演绎过程开发IAI模型，从现有工具中提炼出12个可组合的原子交互范式，并通过案例研究验证模型的应用、精炼和扩展能力。

Result: 验证了模型能够促进系统化设计特征化和比较，案例研究展示了模型在应用、精炼和扩展这些范式方面的实用性。

Conclusion: IAI模型具有描述性、判别性和生成性能力，能够塑造未来的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: Text prompt is the most common way for human-generative AI (GenAI)
communication. Though convenient, it is challenging to convey fine-grained and
referential intent. One promising solution is to combine text prompts with
precise GUI interactions, like brushing and clicking. However, there lacks a
formal model to model synergistic designs between prompts and interactions,
hindering their comparison and innovation. To fill this gap, via an iterative
and deductive process, we develop the Interaction-Augmented Instruction (IAI)
model, a compact entity-relation graph formalizing how the combination of
interactions and text prompts enhances human-generative AI communication. With
the model, we distill twelve recurring and composable atomic interaction
paradigms from prior tools, verifying our model's capability to facilitate
systematic design characterization and comparison. Case studies further
demonstrate the model's utility in applying, refining, and extending these
paradigms. These results illustrate our IAI model's descriptive,
discriminative, and generative power for shaping future GenAI systems.

TL;DR: SIA是一个基于LLM代理的系统，用于分析社交媒体多模态数据，通过协调代理流程连接原始数据、中间输出、分析结果和可视化，支持人类-代理协作的复杂分析任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体产生大量异构数据，现有自动化方法主要局限于结构化表格数据，无法充分处理社交媒体分析的异质性，需要更有效的分析工具。

Method: 构建SIA系统，采用自下而上的分类法连接洞察类型与挖掘可视化技术，通过数据协调器统一表格、文本和网络数据，提供交互式界面支持用户追踪和验证代理推理。

Result: 通过专家案例研究和定量评估，SIA能够有效发现社交媒体中的多样化有意义的洞察，并在复杂分析任务中支持人类-代理协作。

Conclusion: SIA系统成功解决了社交媒体异构数据分析的挑战，提供了透明的工作流程和可信赖的分析结果，推动了社交媒体挖掘领域的发展。

Abstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data,
capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network
structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as
opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However,
discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually
challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization.
Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language
models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot
adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA
(Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous
multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral
data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization
artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy
that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques,
SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure
multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies
tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive
interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and
refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness.
Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that
SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media
while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.

TL;DR: 研究分析了医疗应用中6种不同特征虚拟形象的交互，发现能力是选择虚拟形象的最关键因素，而拟人化程度对健康数据披露影响很小。性别无显著影响，但着装风格很重要，专业着装的男性虚拟形象因性别刻板印象获得更高能力评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟形象的外观显著影响其在医疗应用中的适用性和用户体验，需要研究不同特征虚拟形象与用户偏好的相关性。

Method: 47名参与者完成包含30个PROMIS项目的医疗调查，然后从温暖度、能力、吸引力、拟人化程度以及分享个人数据的意愿等方面对6种不同特征的虚拟形象进行评分。

Result: 能力是虚拟形象选择的最关键因素；拟人化程度对健康数据披露影响很小；性别无显著影响；着装风格是关键因素，专业着装的男性虚拟形象因性别刻板印象获得更高能力评分，而专业女性虚拟形象在温暖度和吸引力方面评分较低。

Conclusion: 在医疗应用中需要精心设计虚拟形象以提升用户体验和参与度，特别要考虑能力感知和着装风格的影响。

Abstract: The appearance of a virtual avatar significantly influences its perceived
appropriateness and the user's experience, particularly in healthcare
applications. This study analyzed interactions with six avatars of varying
characteristics in a patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) application to
investigate correlations between avatar ratings and user preferences.
Forty-seven participants completed a healthcare survey involving 30 PROMIS
items (Global Health and Physical Function) and then rated the avatars on
warmth, competence, attractiveness, and human-likeness, as well as their
willingness to share personal data. The results showed that competence was the
most critical factor in avatar selection, while human-likeness had minimal
impact on health data disclosure. Gender did not significantly affect the
ratings, but clothing style played a key role, with male avatars in
professional attire rated higher in competence due to gender-stereotypical
expectations. In contrast, professional female avatars were rated lower in
warmth and attractiveness. These findings underline the importance of
thoughtful avatar design in healthcare applications to enhance user experience
and engagement.

Motivation: 解决LLMs可能削弱无辅助创造力的问题，探索如何通过角色化指导来平衡探索与收敛，支持而非替代人类创造力。

Method: 开发发散和收敛思维角色的教练式LLM环境，进行对照实验（实验组使用不同角色，对照组使用标准LLM），分析用户行为、感知和表现。

Result: 用户对创造性支持的感知与客观表现不一致；个体差异预测角色使用偏好；交互模式符合设计思维模型；提供了基于角色的指导和个性化的创造性支持系统设计原则。

Conclusion: 角色化指导能在探索与收敛之间取得平衡，推进支持而非遮蔽人类创造力的人机协作工具发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping creative work and
problem-solving; however, prior research suggests that they may diminish
unassisted creativity. To address this tension, a coach-like LLM environment
was developed that embodies divergent and convergent thinking personas as two
complementary processes. Effectiveness and user behavior were assessed through
a controlled experiment in which participants interacted with either persona,
while a control group engaged with a standard LLM providing direct answers.
  Notably, users' perceptions of which persona best supported their creativity
often diverged from objective performance measures. Trait-based analyses
revealed that individual differences predict when people utilize divergent
versus convergent personas, suggesting opportunities for adaptive sequencing.
Furthermore, interaction patterns reflected the design thinking model,
demonstrating how persona-guided support shapes creative problem-solving.
  Our findings provide design principles for creativity support systems that
strike a balance between exploration and convergence through persona-based
guidance and personalization. These insights advance human-AI collaboration
tools that scaffold rather than overshadow human creativity.

Motivation: 理解人类如何评估生成式AI输出的准确性及其自身专业知识，以及自信心在决定是否寻求和依赖AI建议中的作用。

Method: 使用文本生成任务，研究1让参与者自主决定是否寻求AI建议，研究2随机分配参与者接收AI建议，分析自信心变化和决策行为。

Result: 寻求AI建议与对AI的高信心和对自身的低信心相关；接受建议会增加对AI和自身的信心；依赖建议的参与者提供更详细回答但检查不足。

Conclusion: 自信心在人类与生成式AI互动中起关键作用，受个人先验信念和情境性建议接触的影响，过度依赖可能导致对输出验证不足。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can aid humans in a wide range of
tasks, but its effectiveness critically depends on users being able to evaluate
the accuracy of GenAI outputs and their own expertise. Here we asked how
confidence in self and GenAI contributes to decisions to seek and rely on
advice from GenAI ('prospective confidence'), and how advice-taking in turn
shapes this confidence ('retrospective confidence'). In a novel paradigm
involving text generation, participants formulated plans for events, and could
request advice from a GenAI (Study 1; N=200) or were randomly assigned to
receive advice (Study 2; N=300), which they could rely on or ignore. Advice
requests in Study 1 were related to higher prospective confidence in GenAI and
lower confidence in self. Advice-seekers showed increased retrospective
confidence in GenAI, while those who declined advice showed increased
confidence in self. Random assignment in Study 2 revealed that advice exposure
increases confidence in GenAI and in self, suggesting that GenAI advice-taking
causally boosts retrospective confidence. These results were mirrored in advice
reliance, operationalised as the textual similarity between GenAI advice and
participants' responses, with reliance associated with increased retrospective
confidence in both GenAI and self. Critically, participants who chose to
obtain/rely on advice provided more detailed responses (likely due to the
output's verbosity), but failed to check the output thoroughly, missing key
information. These findings underscore a key role for confidence in
interactions with GenAI, shaped by both prior beliefs about oneself and the
reliability of AI, and context-dependent exposure to advice.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了Magentic-Marketplace模拟环境，研究AI代理在双向市场中的行为，发现前沿模型在理想搜索条件下能接近最优福利，但性能随规模扩大急剧下降，所有模型都表现出严重的第一提议偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理越来越多地代表用户进行经济决策，需要了解代理在现实市场条件下的行为，但先前研究主要在受限环境中评估代理，无法反映真实市场的复杂性和动态性。

Method: 开发Magentic-Marketplace模拟环境，其中助手代理代表消费者，服务代理代表竞争企业，研究关键市场动态：代理效用、行为偏见、易受操纵性以及搜索机制如何影响市场结果。

Result: 前沿模型在理想搜索条件下能接近最优福利，但性能随规模扩大急剧下降，所有模型都表现出严重的第一提议偏见，响应速度比质量重要10-30倍。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同市场条件下代理行为的出现方式，为设计公平高效的代理市场提供了信息。

Abstract: As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions,
ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such
applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent
accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires
understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However,
previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as
single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent
interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require
agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large,
dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in
open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic
marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents
represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop
Magentic-Marketplace -- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services
can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the
utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and
how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier
models can approach optimal welfare -- but only under ideal search conditions.
Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe
first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over
quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions,
informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.

Motivation: 研究AI智能体在市场中的交互是否会导致算法合谋，理解涌现行为（如卡特尔或市场支配）对市场的整体影响。

Method: 分层多智能体强化学习框架，包含自利的做市商Agent A和三个底层竞争者：自利的Agent B1、竞争的Agent B2（最小化对手收益）、混合Agent B*（可调节行为）。

Result: Agent B2在零和环境中表现主导，通过积极捕获订单流和收紧平均价差提高市场执行效率；Agent B*与利润寻求智能体共存时表现出自利倾向，通过自适应报价获得主导市场份额，但对Agent A和B1的收益影响较B2温和。

Conclusion: 自适应激励控制支持异质智能体环境中更可持续的战略共存，为算法交易系统的行为设计提供了结构化评估视角。

Abstract: Algorithmic collusion has emerged as a central question in AI: Will the
interaction between different AI agents deployed in markets lead to collusion?
More generally, understanding how emergent behavior, be it a cartel or market
dominance from more advanced bots, affects the market overall is an important
research question.
  We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to
study algorithmic collusion in market making. The framework includes a
self-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain
environment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the
self-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the
competitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent),
and the hybrid Agent~B$^\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the
other two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and
affect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify
behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals
potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.
  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a
zero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening
average spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency. In contrast,
Agent~B$^\star$ exhibits a self-interested inclination when co-existing with
other profit-seeking agents, securing dominant market share through adaptive
quoting, yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of Agents~A and B1
compared to B2. These findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports
more sustainable strategic co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments and
offers a structured lens for evaluating behavioral design in algorithmic
trading systems.

TL;DR: SupervisorAgent是一个轻量级模块化框架，通过运行时自适应监督来提升多智能体系统的效率和鲁棒性，无需改变基础智能体架构，在GAIA基准上平均减少29.45%的token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在复杂任务中表现出色，但随着自主性和操作复杂性的增加，会出现关键效率问题，如过度token消耗和错误信息导致的失败。现有方法主要关注事后故障归因，缺乏主动的实时干预来增强鲁棒性和效率。

Method: 引入SupervisorAgent框架，使用无LLM的自适应过滤器触发，在关键时刻进行干预，主动纠正错误、指导低效行为并净化观察结果，无需改变基础智能体架构。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试中，SupervisorAgent将Smolagent框架的token消耗平均减少29.45%，且不降低成功率。在五个额外基准测试（数学推理、代码生成和问答）和各种SoTA基础模型上的广泛实验验证了该方法的广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SupervisorAgent提供了一种有效的运行时监督方法，显著提高了多智能体系统的效率和鲁棒性，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing
autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies,
such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation.
Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking
proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To
this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for
runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's
architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent
intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide
inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA
benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent
framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate.
Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code
generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate
the broad applicability and robustness of our approach. The code is available
at https://github.com/LINs-lab/SupervisorAgent.

Conclusion: GIFF是一个稳健且有原则的框架，能够利用标准强化学习组件在复杂多智能体系统中实现更公平的结果。

Abstract: We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a
novel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair
decision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained
settings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.
Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and
fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method
computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual
advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off
agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where
an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.
  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,
homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our
framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover
far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by
a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower
bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers
monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled
framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve
more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.
