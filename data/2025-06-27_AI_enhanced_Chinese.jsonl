Each\nadvertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective\nsubject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their\nrelevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare\nprice of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which\nsimultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for\nmixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for\nadditive valuations.\n  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to\nautobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters\nacross heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving\na POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)\nSimplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous\nFPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and\nutility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)\nExtendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve\nprices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous\npayment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first\n(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of\nthe art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing\nalgorithms.

Traditional deep learning-based gesture\nrecognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or\nskeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)\nand Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities\noffer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated\ntask-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for\ndynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art\nVFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing\nskeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for\nhuman-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the\ndifferent gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves\nbest performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific\nclassification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system\ncomplexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model.

Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both\nreal-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results\nshow that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to\nsource-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and\n11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the\nsource-only method.

Data selection has shown promise to mitigate\nredundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing\ntraining costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically\nrely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined\neffect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We\nintroduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample\nredundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic\nstructure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a\nreinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a\nlightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging\nepsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward\nsignal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse\narchitectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art baselines.
