Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

### [2] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多药同时使用可能导致不良反应，现有方法因局限于功能基序表示学习而性能受限，需改进。

Result: 实验表明ImageDDI优于现有方法，在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过结合分子图像和基序序列，显著提升了药物相互作用预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

### [3] [Designing Object Detection Models for TinyML: Foundations, Comparative Analysis, Challenges, and Emerging Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08352)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文综述了在资源受限的TinyML设备上优化目标检测模型的关键技术，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备数量激增，但资源受限难以支持深度学习模型，TinyML为解决此问题提供了可能。现有研究忽略了优化挑战，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 详细分析了量化、剪枝、知识蒸馏和神经架构搜索等优化技术，并探讨了理论与实践的结合。

Result: 比较了现有目标检测模型在微控制器设备上的关键性能指标，展示了预测精度和效率的成熟度。

Conclusion: 论文提供了公开资源库以跟踪领域发展，为边缘人工智能部署提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

### [4] [MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487)
*Qian Wang,Ziqi Huang,Ruoxi Jia,Paul Debevec,Ning Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，用于生成长序列视频故事，解决了现有框架在辅助能力、视觉质量和表达力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力差、视觉质量低和表达力有限的问题，MAViS旨在解决这些限制。

Method: MAViS采用多阶段智能体协作（如脚本编写、镜头设计等），遵循3E原则（探索、检查和增强），并优化脚本与生成工具的兼容性。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和表达力方面达到最先进水平，支持多模态输出（视频、叙事和背景音乐）。

Conclusion: MAViS通过模块化设计和多智能体协作，显著提升了长序列视频生成的质量和表达力，为用户提供了丰富的创作工具。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

### [5] [Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation for Optical Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08421)
*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关且硬件无关的流程，通过Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation（NTKD）提升混合光学神经网络（ONN）的性能，解决了训练精度差距和仿真与硬件实现差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONN）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有能效优势，但其应用受限于训练精度差距和仿真与硬件实现的差异。现有方法缺乏跨任务和硬件设计的通用性。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的流程，包括基于用户约束的模型精度预估和NTKD方法，用于训练和硬件实现后的微调。

Result: 在多个数据集和硬件配置上验证，流程显著提升了ONN性能，支持仿真和实际部署。

Conclusion: 该流程为ONN的实用化部署提供了有效解决方案，解决了现有挑战。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

### [6] [MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488)
*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装虚拟试穿框架，通过联合建模上下服装和人物身份，解决了现有方法在保留身份和服装保真度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法通常分开处理上下服装，依赖繁重预处理，且难以保留人物特定特征（如纹身、配饰和体型），导致真实感和灵活性受限。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：服装表示模块（GRM）捕捉服装语义，人物表示模块（PRM）编码身份和姿态，以及A-DiT融合模块通过扩散变压器整合服装、人物和文本提示特征。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON为虚拟试穿提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

### [7] [CObL: Toward Zero-Shot Ordinal Layering without User Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08498)
*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CObL的扩散模型，用于从图像中推断出由遮挡有序的物体层组成的场景表示，无需用户提示或预先知道物体数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务需要将像素分组为物体并理解其空间关系（包括深度和横向关系），因此需要一种能够捕捉这种关系的场景表示方法。

Method: 采用扩散模型架构CObL，利用Stable Diffusion作为自然物体的先验，并通过推理时间指导确保推断的物体层能够合成回输入图像。

Result: CObL在合成图像上训练后，能够零样本泛化到真实世界多物体场景，且无需预先知道物体数量。

Conclusion: CObL在无需用户干预的情况下实现了多遮挡物体的重建，且泛化能力优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Madhav Kataria,Naitik Agrawal,Yogesh S Rawat,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在序列视觉叙事处理中存在表面识别与深层推理的显著差距。通过漫画叙事的全面研究，发现现有大模型擅长单幅画面解析，但系统性缺乏时间因果性和跨画面连贯性。提出新评估框架，结合多模态标注和嵌入分析，揭示VLMs的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示VLMs在长叙事理解中的不足，特别是时间因果性和跨画面连贯性，以推动模型在深层叙事推理上的改进。

Method: 采用多模态标注、跨模态嵌入分析和检索增强评估，结合Re:Zero漫画的308个标注画面，从生成叙事、对话上下文和时间推理三个维度系统评估。

Result: 当前模型缺乏真正的故事级智能，尤其在非线性叙事、角色一致性和长序列因果推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 本研究为评估叙事智能提供了基础和方法论，并指出VLMs在离散视觉叙事深层理解上的不足与改进方向。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

### [9] [VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521)
*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需侵入模型内部，适用于各种VLM服务模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM行为控制方法（如系统提示）易检测且效果有限，而基于激活的向量需要侵入式访问模型内部，不适用于API服务或闭源部署。

Method: VISOR通过设计通用引导图像，诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上验证，VISOR在拒绝、奉承和生存本能任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像性能接近或超过引导向量。

Conclusion: VISOR展示了视觉通道的行为操控潜力，突显了对视觉引导攻击防御的迫切需求。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [10] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过利用平行文本行图像（原始近代文本与当代日语字体配对）来扩充训练数据集，解决近代日语文档转录中数据稀缺的问题。提出了一种基于距离的目标函数，以减少平行图像对的自注意力特征之间的差距，实验表明该方法显著降低了字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日语文档具有重要历史价值，但转录工作耗时且标注数据有限，导致OCR系统训练困难。

Method: 利用平行文本行图像，提出基于距离的目标函数（欧几里得距离和最大均值差异），以减少自注意力特征的差距。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用欧几里得距离和MMD分别将字符错误率降低了2.23%和3.94%，并提升了自注意力表示的质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了OCR系统对历史文档的处理性能，为近代日语文档的转录提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

### [11] [Calibration Attention: Instance-wise Temperature Scaling for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08547)
*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalAttn是一种用于Vision Transformers的校准模块，通过学习自适应温度值，显著降低校准误差，且不影响模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要，传统方法（如温度缩放）需验证集且仅使用全局标量，效果有限。

Method: 提出CalAttn模块，直接从ViT的CLS令牌学习每个实例的自适应温度值。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低至多4倍，且仅增加不到0.1%的参数。

Conclusion: CalAttn简单高效，适用于多种架构，提供更可信的概率输出，无需牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用框架DTLP-Net，用于解决医学图像分割中的半监督学习、领域泛化和领域适应问题，通过多样化的教师模型生成可靠伪标签，并在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注数据有限和领域偏移是主要挑战，现有方法通常针对单一任务，性能受限。本文旨在开发一个通用框架，解决半监督学习、领域泛化和领域适应问题。

Method: 采用DTLP-Net，包含一个学生模型和两个多样化教师模型，通过解耦训练和动量更新生成可靠伪标签，并结合数据增强和标签传播提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，DTLP-Net在半监督学习、领域泛化和领域适应任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net是一种通用且高效的框架，能够有效解决医学图像分割中的多种挑战性问题。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出FLIPNET模型，通过两种模式（修复和退化）解决盲脸修复中扩散先验的适应性问题，提升真实性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散先验在盲脸修复中存在与真实场景的差距，包括高质量与低质量图像、合成与真实图像的不匹配。

Method: FLIPNET采用统一网络，切换修复模式（整合BFR特征和面部嵌入）和退化模式（合成真实退化图像）。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FLIPNET在真实性和保真度上优于现有方法，且能更好地模拟真实退化。

Conclusion: FLIPNET有效解决了扩散先验在盲脸修复中的适应性问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Conclusion: AutoSAME通过结合分割与关键点定位，并引入FCBA和SGPA，显著提升了LV指标测量的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QueryCraft提出了一种基于语义先验和特征学习的HOI检测框架，通过ACTOR和PDQD提升查询质量，实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR方法在HOI检测中因查询缺乏语义导致性能不佳，QueryCraft旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合ACTOR（跨模态Transformer）和PDQD（感知蒸馏查询解码器），通过语言引导和对象类别感知初始化查询。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并展示强泛化能力。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义先验和双分支查询初始化显著提升了HOI检测性能。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Conclusion: 该方法无需标注即可有效应对复杂虚假相关性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Result: 在基准数据集和实际案例中表现出色，实现了元素级可控性和视频质量的领先水平。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成灵活可控的高质量人体视频提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Conclusion: 强化学习是增强多模态大语言模型在文档理解中可解释性和适应性的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颜色在矢量图形设计中至关重要，但传统方法因数据有限和设计复杂性难以胜任。研究旨在验证预训练LLMs是否能成为更优的颜色推荐工具。

Method: 开发了ColorGPT管道，测试多种颜色表示并应用有效的提示工程技术，专注于颜色调色板补全和完整调色板生成。

Result: 实验表明，ColorGPT在颜色推荐准确性和调色板分布上优于现有方法，同时在完整调色板生成任务中提升了颜色多样性和相似性。

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs在颜色推荐任务中具有潜力，ColorGPT为设计领域提供了一种高效的新方法。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型规模和复杂度的增加，微调成本高昂，需要一种高效的方法将‘弱’模型的知识迁移到‘强’模型上。

Method: 提出TransMiter，通过无监督方式捕捉预训练与微调模型间的知识差距，训练后可跨模型迁移，且仅需少量层。

Result: 实验表明TransMiter能高效迁移知识，保持泛化能力，并在少量标注数据下性能超越微调模型。

Conclusion: TransMiter为视觉语言模型提供了一种高效、轻量的知识迁移解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Conclusion: HVPL有效解决了视频实例分割中的类别动态变化和灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Conclusion: AME是一种即插即用的模块，能显著提升视觉-语言知识蒸馏的泛化性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Motivation: 现有方法难以同时满足水印的不可见性、鲁棒性和广泛适用性，因此需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段通过分布对齐学习建立共同潜在空间，确保水印不可见和鲁棒性；第二阶段通过广义水印表示学习分离水印与图像内容。

Conclusion: HiWL是一种高效且通用的水印方法，显著提升了水印技术的性能。

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

*Tao Luo,Weihua Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态医学图像融合方法MMIF-AMIN，通过可逆密集网络和多尺度互补特征提取模块，结合自适应损失函数，显著提升了融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态医学图像融合（MMIF）旨在整合不同模态的图像以提升诊断效果，但如何同时捕捉独特和互补信息是关键挑战。

Method: 采用可逆密集网络（IDN）进行无损特征提取，设计多尺度互补特征提取模块（MCFEM）结合混合注意力机制和Transformer，并引入自适应损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，MMIF-AMIN在定量和定性分析中均优于九种现有方法，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN不仅在多模态医学图像融合中表现优异，还能扩展到其他图像融合任务。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过视觉提示整合空间和时间信息的新方法，显著提升了任务完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究独立处理空间和时间理解，但缺乏两者的整合。

Method: 通过将视觉轨迹投影到深度图中，同时捕捉空间和时间信息。

Result: 在SimplerEnv中，任务完成率比SpatialVLA提高4%，比TraceVLA提高19%。

Conclusion: 该方法在少量训练数据下仍有效，适用于数据收集困难的现实场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

TL;DR: PADReg是一种基于物理感知的超声图像变形配准框架，利用接触力作为物理先验，显著提升了配准精度和解剖对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像变形配准在捕捉生物力学特性和提升疾病诊断准确性中至关重要，但现有方法在大变形下表现不佳，缺乏物理可解释性。

Method: PADReg通过结合接触力和超声图像的多模态信息构建像素级刚度图，并利用轻量级物理感知模块估计变形场。

Result: 实验表明，PADReg的HD95为12.90，比现有最优方法提升了21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过引入物理约束，实现了更准确的超声图像配准，为疾病诊断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅依赖RGB图像的越野自由空间检测方法ROD，通过预训练的Vision Transformer和轻量级解码器，显著提高了检测精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于越野场景中可通行区域的边界模糊，现有基于多模态（RGB+LiDAR）的方法因计算表面法线图导致推理时间过长，无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: 采用预训练的Vision Transformer提取RGB图像特征，并设计轻量级解码器，避免使用LiDAR数据。

Result: ROD在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新的SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS，显著优于先前模型。

Conclusion: ROD证明了仅用RGB数据即可高效实现越野自由空间检测，为实时应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高压缩视频中的条带伪影严重影响观看体验，尤其是高清视频的平滑区域。现有数据集仅限于静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态。

Method: 创建了包含160个视频的LIVE-YT-Banding数据集，并开发了基于深度神经网络嵌入的无参考评估模型CBAND。

Result: CBAND在条带伪影预测性能上显著优于现有模型，且速度更快，还可作为可微损失函数优化视频去条带模型。

Conclusion: CBAND和LIVE-YT-Banding数据集为视频质量评估和优化提供了有效工具，推动了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了罕见案例相关的错误，提升了模型鲁棒性且未引入新问题。

Conclusion: 提出的修复策略有效解决了视觉识别模型中的罕见语义子群问题，为模型调试提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有深度分割网络在交叉熵损失下对所有像素平等加权，忽略了透镜结构子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的校准问题，而专家标注时对不同子区域有不同置信度。

Method: 提出ACW损失，将透镜结构子区域按置信度分组并加权；设计自适应置信度阈值优化算法；提出边界预期校准误差（BECE）新指标。

Result: 在临床数据集上，ACW显著优于其他方法，IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW方法有效利用了专家标注的置信度先验，显著提升了透镜结构分割的准确性和边界校准。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种模拟社交媒体视频压缩框架，以解决深度伪造检测器在真实场景中泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台对视频的专有压缩破坏了低级取证线索，导致实验室训练的检测器在真实场景中失效。

Method: 通过估计少量上传视频的压缩和调整参数，构建本地模拟器，重现平台特定的压缩效果。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，检测器在模拟数据上微调后性能接近真实数据训练的结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为压缩视频内容的深度伪造检测提供了可扩展的解决方案，弥合了实验室训练与真实部署之间的差距。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估系统在复杂场景中通过自然语言描述检索3D模型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检索系统适用于简单场景，而现实场景更复杂，需要基于模糊的自由形式描述识别物体。

Method: ROOMELSA通过全景房间图像中的特定区域，从大型数据库中检索对应的3D模型。

Result: 实验表明，粗粒度对象检索已基本解决，但细粒度检索仍具挑战性，仅一个模型表现优异。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA为推进鲁棒的3D识别系统提供了新基准，强调了视觉与语言理解的紧密结合。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过结合生成模型和语义先验知识，显著提升了动物姿态估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Motivation: 传统均匀锐化强度忽略了纹理变化，降低视频质量，同时增加比特率，且缺乏优化比特分配的技术。

Method: 利用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，指导并约束增加的比特分配。

Result: 在基准测试中，模型在定性和定量上均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp成功解决了均匀锐化和比特分配问题，提升了视频质量并节省比特率。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 在ZJU-MoCap和MonoCap数据集上，MonoPartNeRF在复杂姿态和遮挡条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF通过创新的变形和姿态建模，实现了更自然的边界过渡和更准确的遮挡恢复。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式有效解决了高效语义分割中的特征对齐问题，且易于集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

*Yuqi Peng,Lingtao Zheng,Yufeng Yang,Yi Huang,Mingfu Yan,Jianzhuang Liu,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Token-Aware LoRA (TARA)方法，解决多概念文本到图像生成中的身份丢失和特征泄漏问题，通过令牌掩码和空间对齐实现高效多概念组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的多概念生成方法存在身份丢失和视觉特征泄漏问题，主要原因是令牌间干扰和空间注意力未对齐。

Method: 提出TARA方法，引入令牌掩码避免模块间干扰，并通过训练目标使罕见令牌的注意力与其概念区域对齐。

Result: 实验表明TARA能高效实现多概念推理，有效保留各概念的视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA为多概念文本到图像生成提供了一种无需训练的解决方案，显著提升了生成效果。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Method: 采用代理式流程，包括设计师、编码器和视觉检查器，形成迭代优化循环。无需额外训练数据或详细用户指令。

Result: 渲染图像在图像分类预训练任务中表现优于先前方法15%。生成的3D原型还可用于改进细粒度视觉语言模型，例如通过微调CLIP实现部件分割，准确率提升55%。

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM展示了直接从MLLMs生成3D原型的潜力，显著提升了空间推理和视觉任务性能，且无需额外标注数据。

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

### [45] [A Parametric Bi-Directional Curvature-Based Framework for Image Artifact Classification and Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08824)
*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向图像曲率分析的无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）框架，通过各向异性纹理丰富度（ATR）度量图像质量，并结合两阶段系统实现高精度分类和量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法在处理不同失真类型时表现有限，需要一种能够同时分类和量化图像退化的鲁棒框架。

Method: 定义ATR度量，使用两个可调阈值计算像素级纹理抑制；通过两阶段系统，先分类主要失真类型（模糊或噪声），再用回归模型量化质量。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR对高斯模糊和白噪声的Spearman相关系数分别达到-0.93和-0.95；完整系统的R2为0.892，RMSE为5.17 DMOS点。

Conclusion: 该框架在图像退化分类和量化方面表现出色，是一种高效的双用途工具。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加比特率和存储成本，需找到优化方案。

Method: 使用频率注意力特征金字塔预测网络（FFPN）预测最佳预处理策略，并通过伪标签训练网络。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了框架在提升视觉质量和节省比特率方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了视频编码中比特率与质量的最佳权衡。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Conclusion: GaussianUpdate在场景变化适应和实时渲染方面表现出色。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Conclusion: MaskClu能帮助ViTs从3D点云中学习更丰富且语义更有意义的表示。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Result: 实验结果表明，该算法在复杂环境条件下表现出色，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过几何化建模和特征空间优化，该方法显著提升了LiDAR地点识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该方法为体数据压缩提供了高效、可扩展的无结构解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Conclusion: 通过纯零样本方法，CLIP模型在MAD任务中表现出色，展示了基础模型在无需微调情况下的直接应用潜力。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

### [58] [TaoCache: Structure-Maintained Video Generation Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08978)
*Zhentao Fan,Zongzuo Wang,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaoCache是一种无需训练、即插即用的缓存策略，通过固定点视角预测噪声输出，有效提升视频扩散模型在后期去噪阶段的性能，同时保持高分辨率结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存加速方法在跳过早期或中期去噪步骤时会导致结构差异，影响指令跟随和角色一致性，因此需要一种更有效的缓存策略。

Method: TaoCache采用固定点视角预测噪声输出，通过校准余弦相似度和噪声增量范数比，实现高效跳过步骤的同时保持结构完整性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，TaoCache在相同加速条件下，视觉质量（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）显著优于现有缓存方法。

Conclusion: TaoCache是一种高效且兼容性强的缓存策略，适用于基于DiT的框架，并能与其他加速方法无缝集成。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

*Ming Nie,Chunwei Wang,Hang Xu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频令牌并突出关键帧信息的方法，显著提升了视频LLMs的计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频LLMs在压缩视频序列时忽略了关键帧的不均匀分布，可能导致重要信息丢失。

Method: KFFocus通过非均匀采样和动态压缩比分配，结合时空建模模块，优化视频令牌压缩。

Result: 在长视频场景下，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: KFFocus为视频LLMs提供了一种高效且精确的压缩方法，解决了关键帧信息丢失的问题。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多尺度量化方法（MSQ），用于解决现有运动表示在多尺度捕捉和组合灵活性上的不足，并通过实验验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动表示方法无法从多尺度捕捉运动且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了复杂模式建模和多样化生成任务的能力。

Method: 提出MSQ方法，通过多尺度离散化压缩运动序列，使用不同编码器捕捉空间多粒度特征，并建立生成掩码建模模型支持运动编辑和控制。

Result: 实验表明，MSQ无需专门设计或重新训练即可无缝组合运动标记，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSQ通过多尺度量化显著提升了运动生成的灵活性和性能，为复杂运动建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有大核卷积网络（ConvNets）虽然有效但参数和计算成本高，且会破坏ERF的渐近高斯分布（AGD），因此需要更高效的方法扩展ERF。

Method: 通过组合小核扩展ERF并保持AGD，设计了Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator和Layer Operator，构建了通用模型UniConvNet。

Conclusion: UniConvNet通过小核组合扩展ERF并保持AGD，实现了高效且高性能的通用卷积网络模型。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Retinex方法在分解图像为光照和反射分量时存在残差（ICR），影响分解精度和最终图像质量。

Method: 提出IRetinex模型，在分解阶段减少分量间特征相似性，在增强阶段利用特征相似性检测和缓解ICR影响。

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在质量和数量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过减少ICR，IRetinex显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Conclusion: UC-Seg通过交叉训练和不确定性感知有效提升半监督医学图像分割性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得耗时且不可靠，亟需一种能有效利用大规模未标注数据的方法。

Method: DPGNet采用文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成模块，结合跨域知识蒸馏，解决域间差异和未标注数据利用问题。

Result: 在11个流行数据集上的实验表明，DPGNet比现有方法性能提升6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet通过有效利用未标注数据，解决了深度伪造检测中的标注挑战，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Result: 实验显示，该方法在模拟真实场景中EBI达到68.91，显著提升动态环境下的适用性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了动态环境中异常检测的阈值适应问题，提升了实用性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Method: 提出VLM-3D框架，结合低秩适应（LoRA）高效适配VLMs，并设计联合语义-几何损失（早期语义损失和后期3D IoU损失）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，感知精度提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失，有效提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

Conclusion: HumanOLAT将促进未来研究，推动重照明和渲染技术的进步。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

<details>

Motivation: 室内光照估计因其高度不适定性而具有挑战性，尤其是当场景光照条件在空间和时间上变化时。

Method: 利用2D扩散先验优化MLP表示的光场，微调预训练扩散模型以预测多位置光照。

Result: 在单图像或视频的室内光照估计中表现优于基线方法，展示了野外视频中时空一致的光照估计。

Conclusion: 该方法在光照估计任务中表现出色，尤其在处理时空变化的光照条件时具有优势。

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge
due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of
the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates
from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally
varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing
such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to
in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict
lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as
light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a
single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.
Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting
estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous
works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表情从一个人或虚拟角色重定向到另一个时，因不同面部框架语义差异导致的困难。

Method: 使用统一面部框架，结合体积变形和Simon-Says表达式校准面部框架，并通过微调优化动画控制。

Conclusion: 通过统一框架和微调方法，实现了高效的面部表情重定向，尤其适用于游戏和虚拟现实场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either
another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR)
environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and
retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same
framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does
not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to
another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when
retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to
fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen
set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion
signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of
Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,
we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says
expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character
rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions
when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these
well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a
performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned
inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry
reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig
used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically
meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order
to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit
differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially
non-differentiable) black box.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合点云滤波方法（HybridPF），结合短程和远程滤波轨迹，通过并行模块（ShortModule和LongModule）优化噪声去除效果，并采用动态图卷积解码器提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有滤波方法存在点聚类或噪声残留问题，需要一种更高效的滤波方法。

Method: 设计并行模块ShortModule和LongModule，分别处理短程分数和远程流，通过联合损失函数端到端训练，并引入动态图卷积解码器。

Result: HybridPF在点云滤波中达到最优效果，同时推理速度更快。

Conclusion: HybridPF通过结合短程和远程信息，显著提升了点云滤波的性能和效率。

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts
that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer
from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose
Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both
short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is
well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may
provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying
clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant
displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the
corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as
intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our
intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide
the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,
score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.
Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,
each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for
short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,
guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point
distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss
function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an
end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement
based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic
graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results
while enabling faster inference speed.

Conclusion: 研究表明City Tower的几何框架为现代空间框架结构设计提供了前瞻性启示。

Abstract: This paper presents a study of computation and morphology of Louis Kahn City
Tower project. The City Tower is an unbuilt design by Louis I. Kahn and Anne
Tyng that integrates form and structure using 3D space triangular geometries.
Although never built, the City Tower geometrical framework anticipated later
developments in design of space-frame structures. Initially envisioned in the
1950s, the City Tower project is a skyscraper structure based on a tetrahedral
and octahedral space frame called Octet-Truss. The aim of this study is to
analyze the geometry of the City Tower structure and how it can be used to
develop modular and adaptable architectural forms. The study is based on an
analytical shape grammar that is used to recreate the original structure, and
later to generate new structural configurations based on the City Tower's
morphology. This study also investigates the potential applications of these
findings in architecture and reveals the possibilities of using tetrahedrons
and octahedrons as fundamental geometries for creating scalable and modular
designs and presents initial findings.

Abstract: This paper presents a study on using Radiolaria as a basis for generation of
space-based geometry for structural design with shape grammars. Radiolaria has
been a source of inspiration for architectural design with its intricate
structural features and geometric patterns (Lim, 2012). We use the basis of the
Radiolaria geometry to create a generative shape grammar as a computational
system; then use the shape grammar to create spatial configurations for
potential applications in design of 3D space structural frames. This study
begins with the geometric analysis of Radiolaria and the dissection of its
structure and geometry into a simplified morphological source, in this case a
tetrahedral structure. Tetrahedrons are used in combination with octahedrons to
generate spatial configurations to generate 3D spatial structural frames. The
paper presents the Radiolaria spatial analysis, the shape grammar, the
collection of generated designs, and possible applications in space frame
structures.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更精细和可控的图像着色过程。

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen
substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object
colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize
color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models
struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire
image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not
explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to
enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate
guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the
effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation
methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate
this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and
conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the
model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more
controlled and refined colorization process.

Method: 采用新型网络架构，结合改进的注意力机制和单色设计，预测间接光照。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有学习技术，能处理复杂光照和未训练场景。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉长距离间接光照和颜色渗透效果，泛化能力强。

Abstract: Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user
realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based
estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then
is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high
dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing
long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks
and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we
present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our
network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global
information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic
design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate
our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at
handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment
lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and
simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color
bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not
present in the training dataset.

Result: DiffPhysCam提升了合成图像任务中的机器人感知性能，并成功用于逆向渲染创建数字孪生场景。

Conclusion: DiffPhysCam为机器人视觉感知和数字孪生提供了高效工具。

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to
support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based
optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that
closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models
and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering
allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins,
facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual
cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical
artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real
transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage
pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key
optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world
data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse
rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture
optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance
in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin
of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics
environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using
images generated by DiffPhysCam.

Motivation: 现有头部旋转预测算法通常忽视认知动机，导致虚拟代理行为不自然。SCORE旨在解决这一问题，提升虚拟环境的真实感。

Method: SCORE结合视觉语言模型（VLM）和大语言模型（LLM），通过符号化认知推理生成头部运动，并利用轻量级FastVLM进行在线验证。

Result: SCORE能预测头部运动的动机（如兴趣、信息寻求等），泛化至未见场景和多代理群体，保持行为合理性。

Conclusion: SCORE为虚拟代理的头部旋转行为提供了一种数据无关、动机驱动的解决方案，显著提升了真实感。

Abstract: Natural head rotation is critical for believable embodied virtual agents, yet
this micro-level behavior remains largely underexplored. While head-rotation
prediction algorithms could, in principle, reproduce this behavior, they
typically focus on visually salient stimuli and overlook the cognitive motives
that guide head rotation. This yields agents that look at conspicuous objects
while overlooking obstacles or task-relevant cues, diminishing realism in a
virtual environment. We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning
framework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces
context-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned
heuristics. A controlled VR study (N=20) identifies five motivational drivers
of human head movements: Interest, Information Seeking, Safety, Social Schema,
and Habit. SCORE encodes these drivers as symbolic predicates, perceives the
scene with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and plans head poses with a Large
Language Model (LLM). The framework employs a hybrid workflow: the VLM-LLM
reasoning is executed offline, after which a lightweight FastVLM performs
online validation to suppress hallucinations while maintaining responsiveness
to scene dynamics. The result is an agent that predicts not only where to look
but also why, generalizing to unseen scenes and multi-agent crowds while
retaining behavioral plausibility.

Conclusion: VertexRegen在保持网格质量的同时，提供了灵活的中断生成能力，适用于多种细节需求。

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables
generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods
generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of
generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from
progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge
collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental
results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to
state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the
flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of
detail.

Conclusion: ColorCtrl在图像和视频编辑中均表现出色，具有广泛适用性和高一致性。

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved
problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including
albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical
consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.
Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks
but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual
inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present
ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention
mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By
disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention
maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color
editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method
modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated
areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate
that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.
Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1
Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended
to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,
particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,
our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such
as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

Motivation: 传统PID调节器依赖简化的电网模型，难以适应实际电网的复杂性和动态变化，可能导致性能下降或不稳定。

Method: 采用数据驱动的预测控制（DeePC），通过数据感知电网特性并动态调整控制策略，实现优化和鲁棒控制。

Result: 通过高保真仿真和硬件在环测试验证了DeePConverters的有效性。

Conclusion: DeePConverters能够适应复杂电网环境，提供更优和更稳定的控制性能。

Abstract: Grid-connected power converters are ubiquitous in modern power systems,
acting as grid interfaces of renewable energy sources, energy storage systems,
electric vehicles, high-voltage DC systems, etc. Conventionally, power
converters use multiple PID regulators to achieve different control objectives
such as grid synchronization and voltage/power regulations, where the PID
parameters are usually tuned based on a presumed (and often overly-simplified)
power grid model. However, this may lead to inferior performance or even
instabilities in practice, as the real power grid is highly complex, variable,
and generally unknown. To tackle this problem, we employ a data-enabled
predictive control (DeePC) to perform data-driven, optimal, and robust control
for power converters. We call the converters that are operated in this way
\textit{DeePConverters}. A DeePConverter can implicitly perceive the
characteristics of the power grid from data and adjust its control strategy to
achieve optimal and robust performance. We present the modular configurations,
generalized structure, control behavior specification, detailed implementation,
and computation of DeePConverters. High-fidelity simulations and
hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests are provided to validate the effectiveness of
DeePConverters.

Result: 发现设备内性能差异显著（误差增加达101%），设备间性能差异高达2.8倍，且跟踪精度与视觉条件和运动动态密切相关。Apple Vision Pro在相对姿态误差估计上表现优异（R²=0.830），但绝对姿态误差估计有限（R²=0.387）。

Conclusion: 该研究为XR跟踪性能评估建立了首个标准化框架，提供了可重复的方法、全面的基准数据集和开源工具，有助于加速开发更稳健的XR空间感知技术。

Abstract: Inaccurate spatial tracking in extended reality (XR) devices leads to virtual
object jitter, misalignment, and user discomfort, fundamentally limiting
immersive experiences and natural interactions. In this work, we introduce a
novel testbed that enables simultaneous, synchronized evaluation of multiple XR
devices under identical environmental and kinematic conditions. Leveraging this
platform, we present the first comprehensive empirical benchmarking of five
state-of-the-art XR devices across 16 diverse scenarios. Our results reveal
substantial intra-device performance variation, with individual devices
exhibiting up to 101\% increases in error when operating in featureless
environments. We also demonstrate that tracking accuracy strongly correlates
with visual conditions and motion dynamics. We also observe significant
inter-device disparities, with performance differences of up to 2.8$\times$,
which are closely linked to hardware specifications such as sensor
configurations and dedicated processing units. Finally, we explore the
feasibility of substituting a motion capture system with the Apple Vision Pro
as a practical ground truth reference. While the Apple Vision Pro delivers
highly accurate relative pose error estimates ($R^2 = 0.830$), its absolute
pose error estimation remains limited ($R^2 = 0.387$), highlighting both its
potential and its constraints for rigorous XR evaluation. This work establishes
the first standardized framework for comparative XR tracking evaluation,
providing the research community with reproducible methodologies, comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and open-source tools that enable systematic analysis of
tracking performance across devices and conditions, thereby accelerating the
development of more robust spatial sensing technologies for XR systems.

high computational demands, especially with the advancement in embedded machine
learning and edge computing. Designing application-specific circuits is crucial
to reducing hardware complexity and power consumption. In these perspectives,
this paper presents the design of a Digital Time-to-Digital converter (DTDC)
based on multiple delay line topologies. The DTDC is implemented in VHDL for
the Xilinx Artix-7 AC701 FPGA device. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the circuit in converting the input period along a wide range
up to 1ps. The designed circuit is implemented with less than 1% of the
resource utilization on the target FPGA device.

*Ninad Gaikwad,Anamika Dubey*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可扩展的家庭能源管理系统（HEMS）模拟器，支持任意数量的房屋和不同的分布式能源资源（DER）配置，适用于并网和离网场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HEMS模拟器缺乏灵活性和可扩展性，限制了其对多样化DER配置和房屋数量的支持。

Method: 开发了一个基于Gymnasium环境的模拟器，支持多种DER配置（如屋顶光伏、电池等），并集成了天气和负载数据。

Result: 模拟器成功展示了其在单个房屋和四户社区中的灵活性，并通过内置指标和计算时间对控制器进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: 该模拟器能够系统评估不同系统配置下的控制策略性能，为HEMS研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) are being actively developed for both
individual houses and communities to support demand response in on-grid
operation, and ensure resilience during off-grid scenarios. However, most
simulators used for closed-loop HEMS testing are tailored to a specific
distributed energy resource (DER) configuration with a fixed number of houses,
limiting flexibility and scalability. This leads to additional development
efforts to support diverse DER configurations across any number of houses and
to integrate appropriate weather and load data pipelines. To address these
limitations, we present a scalable simulator capable of modeling any number of
houses in both on-grid and off-grid modes as a Gymnasium environment. Each
house can have a unique DER configuration - Rooftop Solar Photovoltaics (PV),
Battery-only, PV-only, or no DER - and includes models for air-conditioning and
eight grouped circuit-level loads. The simulator integrates National Solar
Radiation Database (NSRDB) weather and Pecan Street load datasets, supports
three default controllers (two for off-grid, and one for on-grid scenarios),
and includes performance metrics and visualization tools. We demonstrate its
flexibility through simulations on individual houses and a four-house community
with heterogeneous DERs, benchmarking the controllers across built-in metrics
and computation time. The results highlight the simulator's capability to
systematically evaluate control policy performance under varying system
configurations.

Abstract: We need computationally efficient and accurate building thermal dynamics
models for use in grid-edge applications. This work evaluates two grey-box

estimation methods including Nonlinear Least Squares, Batch Estimation, and
Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We use the Almon Lag Structure with Linear Least
Squares for estimating the structured regression models. The performance of
these models and methods is evaluated on simulated house and commercial
building data across three different simulation types.

Method: 综述了基于Lyapunov和屏障函数的安全强化学习方法，包括模型基于和模型无关的RL技术。

Result: 总结了现有方法的优缺点，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: Lyapunov和屏障函数在安全强化学习中具有潜力，但仍需进一步研究以完善理论和应用。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be particularly effective in
solving complex decision-making problems for a wide range of applications. From
a control theory perspective, RL can be considered as an adaptive optimal
control scheme. Lyapunov and barrier functions are the most commonly used
certificates to guarantee system stability for a proposed/derived controller
and constraint satisfaction guarantees, respectively, in control theoretic
approaches. However, compared to theoretical guarantees available in control
theoretic methods, RL lacks closed-loop stability of a computed policy and
constraint satisfaction guarantees. Safe reinforcement learning refers to a
class of constrained problems where the constraint violations lead to partial
or complete system failure. The goal of this review is to provide an overview
of safe RL techniques using Lyapunov and barrier functions to guarantee this
notion of safety discussed (stability of the system in terms of a computed
policy and constraint satisfaction during training and deployment). The
different approaches employed are discussed in detail along with their
shortcomings and benefits to provide critique and possible future research
directions. Key motivation for this review is to discuss current theoretical
approaches for safety and stability guarantees in RL similar to control
theoretic approaches using Lyapunov and barrier functions. The review provides
proven potential and promising scope of providing safety guarantees for complex
dynamical systems with operational constraints using model-based and model-free
RL.

Result: 云端部署语音质量最佳，边缘辅助架构在5G和Wi-Fi 6下满足实时需求，平衡延迟与清晰度。

Conclusion: 边缘辅助架构在实时应用中表现最优，为AVSE系统部署提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new AI-based Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement (AVSE)
system and presents a comparative performance analysis of different deployment
architectures. The proposed AVSE system employs convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spectral feature extraction and long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks for temporal modeling, enabling robust speech enhancement through
multimodal fusion of audio and visual cues. Multiple deployment scenarios are
investigated, including cloud-based, edge-assisted, and standalone device
implementations. Their performance is evaluated in terms of speech quality
improvement, latency, and computational overhead. Real-world experiments are
conducted across various network conditions, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 4G, and
5G, to analyze the trade-offs between processing delay, communication latency,
and perceptual speech quality. The results show that while cloud deployment
achieves the highest enhancement quality, edge-assisted architectures offer the
best balance between latency and intelligibility, meeting real-time
requirements under 5G and Wi-Fi 6 conditions. These findings provide practical
guidelines for selecting and optimizing AVSE deployment architectures in
diverse applications, including assistive hearing devices, telepresence, and
industrial communications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频配音中，由于语言信息密度的差异，目标语音与源语音时长不匹配会导致音视频同步问题，影响观看体验。

Method: 提出Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO)方法，采用分段采样策略和细粒度损失优化时长对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，SSPO在时长对齐任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SSPO方法有效解决了视频配音中的时长不匹配问题，提升了配音质量。

Abstract: Video dubbing aims to translate original speech in visual media programs from
the source language to the target language, relying on neural machine
translation and text-to-speech technologies. Due to varying information
densities across languages, target speech often mismatches the source speech
duration, causing audio-video synchronization issues that significantly impact
viewer experience. In this study, we approach duration alignment in LLM-based
video dubbing machine translation as a preference optimization problem. We
propose the Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) method, which
employs a segment-wise sampling strategy and fine-grained loss to mitigate
duration mismatches between source and target lines. Experimental results
demonstrate that SSPO achieves superior performance in duration alignment
tasks.

Result: 多目标攻击成功率达95.04%，说话人验证任务中目标与注册说话人高度相似时成功率可达90%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多目标和说话人验证任务中均表现高效，揭示了后门攻击在复杂场景中的潜在威胁。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a multi-target backdoor attack against speaker
identification using position-independent clicking sounds as triggers. Unlike
previous single-target approaches, our method targets up to 50 speakers
simultaneously, achieving success rates of up to 95.04%. To simulate more
realistic attack conditions, we vary the signal-to-noise ratio between speech
and trigger, demonstrating a trade-off between stealth and effectiveness. We
further extend the attack to the speaker verification task by selecting the
most similar training speaker - based on cosine similarity - as the target. The
attack is most effective when target and enrolled speaker pairs are highly
similar, reaching success rates of up to 90% in such cases.

Motivation: 现有方法（如基于幽灵细胞的FDTD）在复杂边界下存在较大误差和失败，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂场景下的声辐射模拟中优于现有方法，精度和效率均有提升。

Conclusion: SonicRadiation方法有效解决了复杂边界下的声辐射模拟问题，结合了TDBEM和FDTD的优势。

Abstract: Interactive synthesis of physical sound effects is crucial in digital media
production. Sound radiation simulation, a key component of physically based
sound synthesis, has posed challenges in the context of complex object
boundaries. Previous methods, such as ghost cell-based finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) wave solver, have struggled to address these challenges,
leading to large errors and failures in complex boundaries because of the
limitation of ghost cells. We present SonicRadiation, a hybrid numerical
solution capable of handling complex and dynamic object boundaries in sound
radiation simulation without relying on ghost cells. We derive a consistent
formulation to connect the physical quantities on grid cells in FDTD with the
boundary elements in the time-domain boundary element method (TDBEM). Hereby,
we propose a boundary grid synchronization strategy to seamlessly integrate
TDBEM with FDTD while maintaining high numerical accuracy. Our method holds
both advantages from the accuracy of TDBEM for the near-field and the
efficiency of FDTD for the far-field. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of our method in sound radiation simulation over previous
approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly in complex scenes,
further validating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 研究生成式AI在音乐创作中的早期开发和采用背后的意识形态，尤其是民主化口号与实际操作的差距。

Method: 采用自民族志和数字民族志方法，分析开发者宣传与产品功能之间的不一致性。

Result: 发现开发者和用户共享的意识形态是个人主义、全球主义、技术自由主义且回避伦理的，这种“整体意识形态”模糊了个人责任。

Conclusion: 生成式AI音乐系统通过意识形态重塑了音乐的本质和实践，其民主化口号更多是市场宣传而非真实原则。

Abstract: AI systems for music generation are increasingly common and easy to use,
granting people without any musical background the ability to create music.
Because of this, generative-AI has been marketed and celebrated as a means of
democratizing music making. However, inclusivity often functions as marketable
rhetoric rather than a genuine guiding principle in these industry settings. In
this paper, we look at four generative-AI music making systems available to the
public as of mid-2025 (AIVA, Stable Audio, Suno, and Udio) and track how they
are rhetoricized by their developers, and received by users. Our aim is to
investigate ideologies that are driving the early-stage development and
adoption of generative-AI in music making, with a particular focus on
democratization. A combination of autoethnography and digital ethnography is
used to examine patterns and incongruities in rhetoric when positioned against
product functionality. The results are then collated to develop a nuanced,
contextual discussion. The shared ideology we map between producers and
consumers is individualist, globalist, techno-liberal, and ethically evasive.
It is a 'total ideology' which obfuscates individual responsibility, and
through which the nature of music and musical practice is transfigured to suit
generative outcomes.

Motivation: 医疗领域对AI的需求增长迅速，但数据稀缺问题突出，尤其是在COVID-19疫情期间。研究旨在通过合成数据缓解这一问题，提升模型性能。

Method: 使用ACGAN生成合成咳嗽的Mel频谱图，并用于增强CNN分类器的训练数据。

Result: 合成数据使CNN分类器的测试准确率从72%提升至75%。

Conclusion: 研究展示了合成数据在医疗AI中的潜力，并提供了处理训练中不一致性的见解。

Abstract: One of the fastest-growing domains in AI is healthcare. Given its importance,
it has been the interest of many researchers to deploy ML models into the
ever-demanding healthcare domain to aid doctors and increase accessibility.
Delivering reliable models, however, demands a sizable amount of data, and the
recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder of the rampant and scary nature
of healthcare that makes training models difficult. To alleviate such scarcity,
many published works attempted to synthesize radiological cough data to train
better COVID-19 detection models on the respective radiological data. To
accommodate the time sensitivity expected during a pandemic, this work focuses
on detecting COVID-19 through coughs using synthetic data to improve the
accuracy of the classifier. The work begins by training a CNN on a balanced
subset of the Coughvid dataset, establishing a baseline classification test
accuracy of 72%. The paper demonstrates how an Auxiliary Classification GAN
(ACGAN) may be trained to conditionally generate novel synthetic Mel
Spectrograms of both healthy and COVID-19 coughs. These coughs are used to
augment the training dataset of the CNN classifier, allowing it to reach a new
test accuracy of 75%. The work highlights the expected messiness and
inconsistency in training and offers insights into detecting and handling such
shortcomings.

Motivation: 现有方法将MOS预测视为回归问题，但忽略了感知判断的相对性，导致评估效果不佳。

Method: 提出QAMRO框架，结合回归目标和自适应边界排序优化，利用预训练音频-文本模型（如CLAP和Audiobox-Aesthetics）。

Result: 在AudioMOS Challenge 2025数据集上表现优异，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: QAMRO框架在多维感知评估中与人类评价更一致，为音频生成系统提供了更准确的评估工具。

Abstract: Evaluating audio generation systems, including text-to-music (TTM),
text-to-speech (TTS), and text-to-audio (TTA), remains challenging due to the
subjective and multi-dimensional nature of human perception. Existing methods
treat mean opinion score (MOS) prediction as a regression problem, but standard
regression losses overlook the relativity of perceptual judgments. To address
this limitation, we introduce QAMRO, a novel Quality-aware Adaptive Margin
Ranking Optimization framework that seamlessly integrates regression objectives
from different perspectives, aiming to highlight perceptual differences and
prioritize accurate ratings. Our framework leverages pre-trained audio-text
models such as CLAP and Audiobox-Aesthetics, and is trained exclusively on the
official AudioMOS Challenge 2025 dataset. It demonstrates superior alignment
with human evaluations across all dimensions, significantly outperforming
robust baseline models.

Motivation: 扩展预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）的语音能力面临模态差异和任务优化挑战，需要统一解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效促进理解和生成任务的互补关系，提升统一模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过USTokenizer和DualSpeechLM，成功实现语音理解和生成任务的统一与优化。

Abstract: Extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)'s speech understanding or
generation abilities by introducing various effective speech tokens has
attracted great attention in the speech community. However, building a unified
speech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges:
(1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens,
extending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data
for fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information
at different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features,
while understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to
difficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these
challenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization
and speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an
Understanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level
semantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text
LLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which
reduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech
LLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that
concurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a
unified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and
generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision
loss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and
enhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between
understanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of
mutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.

Motivation: 预训练的ASR模型在不同录音通道下的性能会显著下降，传统研究将其归因于训练与测试语料的不匹配，但本文认为通道差异会从根本上损害ASR性能。

Method: 提出了一种归一化技术，通过将模型内部特征与干净参考通道的特征表示对齐，以减少通道变化的影响。

Result: 该方法显著提高了ASR在未见过的通道和语言上的性能，展示了其跨通道和跨语言的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该归一化技术有效缓解了通道差异对ASR性能的负面影响，并具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated
strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can
degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording
channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often
attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study
argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording
channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we
propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel
variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with
those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly
improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages,
highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences.

Motivation: 当前手术错误检测方法因训练数据有限和方法限制难以应对机器人辅助手术的复杂挑战。

Method: 提出CARES框架，采用风险分层代理推理架构，通过动态生成医学知识引导的提示，实现多类错误检测。

Result: 在RARP和MERP数据集上分别达到54.3和52.0的mF1分数，优于现有零样本方法14%。

Conclusion: CARES框架在零样本条件下表现出色，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) introduces complex challenges that current
surgical error detection methods struggle to address effectively due to limited
training data and methodological constraints. Therefore, we construct MERP
(Multi-class Error in Robotic Prostatectomy), a comprehensive dataset for error
detection in robotic prostatectomy with frame-level annotations featuring six
clinically aligned error categories. In addition, we propose CARES
(Collaborative Agentic Reasoning for Error Detection in Surgery), a novel
zero-shot clinically-informed and risk-stratified agentic reasoning
architecture for multi-class surgical error detection. CARES implements
adaptive generation of medically informed, error-specific Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompts across multiple expertise levels. The framework employs
risk-aware routing to assign error task to expertise-matched reasoning pathways
based on complexity and clinical impact. Subsequently, each pathway decomposes
surgical error analysis into three specialized agents with temporal, spatial,
and procedural analysis. Each agent analyzes using dynamically selected prompts
tailored to the assigned expertise level and error type, generating detailed
and transparent reasoning traces. By incorporating clinically informed
reasoning from established surgical assessment guidelines, CARES enables
zero-shot surgical error detection without prior training. Evaluation
demonstrates superior performance with 54.3 mF1 on RARP and 52.0 mF1 on MERP
datasets, outperforming existing zero-shot approaches by up to 14% while
remaining competitive with trained models. Ablation studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

deployments, failures of computational components are inevitable, presenting a
critical challenge: ensuring that multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
policies remain effective even when some agents malfunction. We propose the
Multi-Agent Robust Training Algorithm (MARTA), a plug-and-play framework for
training MARL agents to be resilient to potentially severe faults. MARTA
operates in cooperative multi-agent settings where agents may lose the ability
to execute their intended actions. It learns to identify failure scenarios that
are especially detrimental to system performance and equips agents with
strategies to mitigate their impact. At the heart of MARTA is a novel
adversarial Markov game in which an adversary -- modelled via \emph{Markov
switching controls} -- learns to disable agents in high-risk state regions,
while the remaining agents are trained to \emph{jointly} best-respond to such
targeted malfunctions. To ensure practicality, MARTA enforces a malfunction
budget, constraining the adversary to a fixed number of failures and learning
robust policies accordingly. We provide theoretical guarantees that MARTA
converges to a Markov perfect equilibrium, ensuring agents optimally counteract
worst-case faults. Empirically, we show that MARTA achieves state-of-the-art
fault-tolerant performance across benchmark environments, including Multi-Agent
Particle World and Level-Based Foraging.

### [103] [Convergent Q-Learning for Infinite-Horizon General-Sum Markov Games through Behavioral Economics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08669)
*Yizhou Zhang,Eric Mazumdar*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了风险厌恶量化反应均衡（RQE）的计算问题，扩展了其在双人标准形式博弈和无限时域马尔可夫博弈中的应用，并提出了收敛保证的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类决策具有风险厌恶和有限理性的特点，RQE能更真实地描述决策行为，但此前研究主要集中于有限时域马尔可夫博弈。本文旨在扩展RQE的计算方法至更广泛的博弈场景。

Method: 在标准形式博弈中采用单调性方法证明RQE的唯一性和连续性；在无限时域马尔可夫博弈中定义风险厌恶量化反应Bellman算子，并证明其收缩性。

Result: 在单调性条件下，RQE具有唯一性和连续性；在特定条件下，Bellman算子收缩，从而提出收敛的Q学习算法。

Conclusion: RQE在更广泛的博弈场景中具有计算可行性，为多智能体强化学习提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Risk-aversion and bounded rationality are two key characteristics of human
decision-making. Risk-averse quantal-response equilibrium (RQE) is a solution
concept that incorporates these features, providing a more realistic depiction
of human decision making in various strategic environments compared to a Nash
equilibrium. Furthermore a class of RQE has recently been shown in
arXiv:2406.14156 to be universally computationally tractable in all
finite-horizon Markov games, allowing for the development of multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms with convergence guarantees. In this paper,
we expand upon the study of RQE and analyze their computation in both
two-player normal form games and discounted infinite-horizon Markov games. For
normal form games we adopt a monotonicity-based approach allowing us to
generalize previous results. We first show uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity
of RQE with respect to player's payoff matrices under monotonicity assumptions,
and then provide conditions on the players' degrees of risk aversion and
bounded rationality that ensure monotonicity. We then focus on discounted
infinite-horizon Markov games. We define the risk-averse quantal-response
Bellman operator and prove its contraction under further conditions on the
players' risk-aversion, bounded rationality, and temporal discounting. This
yields a Q-learning based algorithm with convergence guarantees for all
infinite-horizon general-sum Markov games.

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过添加物品解决初始分配中的嫉妒问题，给出了可解实例的特征，并提出了多项式时间算法。在限制条件下问题变得复杂，但通过参数化分析仍能高效判断解的存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决初始分配中的嫉妒问题，通过添加物品实现公平分配，具有理论和实际意义。

Method: 通过特征化可解实例，提出多项式时间算法，并进行参数化复杂度分析。

Result: 在无限制情况下可高效求解，但在限制条件下问题复杂。参数化分析有助于判断解的存在性。

Conclusion: 论文提供了解决嫉妒问题的有效方法，理论结果显著且实用。

Abstract: We consider the problem of resolving the envy of a given initial allocation
by adding elements from a pool of goods. We give a characterization of the
instances where envy can be resolved by adding an arbitrary number of copies of
the items in the pool. From this characterization, we derive a polynomial-time
algorithm returning a respective solution if it exists. If the number of copies
or the total number of added items are bounded, the problem becomes
computationally intractable even in various restricted cases. We perform a
parameterized complexity analysis, focusing on the number of agents and the
pool size as parameters. Notably, although not every instance admits an
envy-free solution, our approach allows us to efficiently determine, in
polynomial time, whether a solution exists-an aspect that is both theoretically
interesting and far from trivial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升广告分配效率对广告平台的经济效益至关重要，但现有方法未充分结合质量价值（广告对发布者长期收益的影响）。

Method: 建立三方拍卖框架，提出统一福利指标，设计q-Boost算法计算最优提升因子。

Result: 在Alibaba数据集上验证，q-Boost算法比传统方法提升2%-6%的福利。

Conclusion: q-Boost算法有效优化了广告分配效率，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Online bidding is crucial in mobile ecosystems, enabling real-time ad
allocation across billions of devices to optimize performance and user
experience. Improving ad allocation efficiency is a long-standing research
problem, as it directly enhances the economic outcomes for all participants in
advertising platforms. This paper investigates the design of optimal boost
factors in online bidding while incorporating quality value (the impact of
displayed ads on publishers' long-term benefits). To address the divergent
interests on quality, we establish a three-party auction framework with a
unified welfare metric of advertiser and publisher. Within this framework, we
derive the theoretical efficiency lower bound for C-competitive boost in
second-price single-slot auctions, then design a novel quality-involved
Boosting (q-Boost) algorithm for computing the optimal boost factor.
Experimental validation on Alibaba's public dataset (AuctionNet) demonstrates
2%-6% welfare improvements over conventional approaches, proving our method's
effectiveness in real-world settings.

Motivation: 研究公共事务中动态偏好对投票模型的影响，旨在优化社会福利并探讨公平性。

Method: 采用计算复杂性分析，研究功利主义和平均主义福利的优化问题，探讨时间公平性和在线算法，分析代理人的策略行为。

Result: 功利主义福利优化简单，平均主义福利优化复杂，但在某些情况下可高效解决。时间公平性影响福利，在线算法有竞争比。代理人存在策略行为。

Conclusion: 公共事务投票模型中，福利优化和公平性需权衡，某些情况下可高效解决，但策略行为和公平性度量仍需深入研究。

Abstract: We study a temporal voting model where voters have dynamic preferences over a
set of public chores -- projects that benefit society, but impose individual
costs on those affected by their implementation. We investigate the
computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Our
results show that while optimizing the former is computationally
straightforward, minimizing the latter is computationally intractable, even in
very restricted cases. Nevertheless, we identify several settings where this
problem can be solved efficiently, either exactly or by an approximation
algorithm. We also examine the effects of enforcing temporal fairness and its
impact on social welfare, and analyze the competitive ratio of online
algorithms. We then explore the strategic behavior of agents, providing
insights into potential malfeasance in such decision-making environments.
Finally, we discuss a range of fairness measures and their suitability for our
setting.

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，用于在低剂量儿科X射线中降噪并保留诊断相关特征，显著提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源匮乏地区，低剂量儿科X射线成像因噪声问题影响诊断准确性，传统降噪方法会损失细节。

Method: 采用Laplacian引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在各项指标上优于现有方法，肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在低资源儿科护理中具有显著诊断价值，且计算高效。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可视化工具和框架对信息揭示与隐藏缺乏明确指导，设计师往往无意中隐藏信息。本文旨在系统化描述可视化如何限制对底层数据的访问。

Method: 通过对425个可视化技术样本的内容分析，构建了一个基于数据表示变化的披露策略分类法。

Result: 分类法为设计师提供了一种系统化的方法，用于权衡信息揭示、扭曲或隐藏的设计选择。

Conclusion: 将披露作为可视化研究的框架，为工具开发、信息素养、不确定性沟通、个性化及伦理设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Visualizing data often entails data transformations that can reveal and hide
information, operations we dub disclosure tactics. Whether designers hide
information intentionally or as an implicit consequence of other design
choices, tools and frameworks for visualization offer little explicit guidance
on disclosure. To systematically characterize how visualizations can limit
access to an underlying dataset, we contribute a content analysis of 425
examples of visualization techniques sampled from academic papers in the
visualization literature, resulting in a taxonomy of disclosure tactics. Our
taxonomy organizes disclosure tactics based on how they change the data
representation underlying a chart, providing a systematic way to reason about
design trade-offs in terms of what information is revealed, distorted, or
hidden. We demonstrate the benefits of using our taxonomy by showing how it can
guide reasoning in design scenarios where disclosure is a first-order
consideration. Adopting disclosure as a framework for visualization research
offers new perspective on authoring tools, literacy, uncertainty communication,
personalization, and ethical design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI和AR技术多将儿童定位为消费者，而非创造者。Capybara旨在改变这一现状，赋予儿童创造和编程的能力。

Method: Capybara结合文本生成3D模型、自动骨骼绑定、身体追踪和视觉AI模型，使儿童能创建虚拟角色并编程交互行为。

Result: 用户研究表明，Capybara能帮助儿童创作个性化AR体验，无缝连接虚拟与现实世界。

Conclusion: Capybara展示了AI和AR技术在儿童创造力培养中的潜力，成功将儿童从消费者转变为创造者。

Abstract: Despite their potential to enhance children's learning experiences,
AI-enabled AR technologies are predominantly used in ways that position
children as consumers rather than creators. We introduce Capybara, an AR-based
and AI-powered visual programming environment that empowers children to create,
customize, and program 3D characters overlaid onto the physical world. Capybara
enables children to create virtual characters and accessories using text-to-3D
generative AI models, and to animate these characters through auto-rigging and
body tracking. In addition, our system employs vision-based AI models to
recognize physical objects, allowing children to program interactive behaviors
between virtual characters and their physical surroundings. We demonstrate the
expressiveness of Capybara through a set of novel AR experiences. We conducted
user studies with 20 children in the United States and Argentina. Our findings
suggest that Capybara can empower children to harness AI in authoring
personalized and engaging AR experiences that seamlessly bridge the virtual and
physical worlds.

Method: 收集真实和伪造的空中签名数据，使用传统和深度学习方法进行验证，并尝试从惯性传感器数据重建三维轨迹。

Result: 验证了空中签名系统的鲁棒性，并证明从惯性数据重建轨迹是可行的，挑战了空中手势无痕的假设。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了惯性传感器数据可能泄露用户隐私信息，呼吁重新评估空中签名系统的隐私设计。

Abstract: Behavioral biometrics based on smartphone motion sensors are growing in
popularity for authentication purposes. In this study, AirSignatureDB is
presented: a new publicly accessible dataset of in-air signatures collected
from 108 participants under real-world conditions, using 83 different
smartphone models across four sessions. This dataset includes genuine samples
and skilled forgeries, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of system robustness
against realistic attack scenarios. Traditional and deep learning-based methods
for in-air signature verification are benchmarked, while analyzing the
influence of sensor modality and enrollment strategies. Beyond verification, a
first approach to reconstructing the three-dimensional trajectory of in-air
signatures from inertial sensor data alone is introduced. Using on-line
handwritten signatures as a reference, we demonstrate that the recovery of
accurate trajectories is feasible, challenging the long-held assumption that
in-air gestures are inherently traceless. Although this approach enables
forensic traceability, it also raises critical questions about the privacy
boundaries of behavioral biometrics. Our findings underscore the need for a
reevaluation of the privacy assumptions surrounding inertial sensor data, as
they can reveal user-specific information that had not previously been
considered in the design of in-air signature systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟现实中目标选择因距离、大小、遮挡等问题具有挑战性，现有技术复杂且局限。

Method: Adaptique通过分析目标大小、距离、遮挡和用户姿势等上下文信息，结合速度、准确性、舒适性和熟悉度目标，动态切换最优选择技术。

Result: 用户研究表明，Adaptique比单一技术更受欢迎且性能更优，并在应用中展示了其多功能性。

Conclusion: Adaptique通过自适应技术选择，显著提升了虚拟现实中的目标选择体验。

Abstract: Selection is a fundamental task that is challenging in virtual reality due to
issues such as distant and small targets, occlusion, and target-dense
environments. Previous research has tackled these challenges through various
selection techniques, but complicates selection and can be seen as tedious
outside of their designed use case. We present Adaptique, an adaptive model
that infers and switches to the most optimal selection technique based on user
and environmental information. Adaptique considers contextual information such
as target size, distance, occlusion, and user posture combined with four
objectives: speed, accuracy, comfort, and familiarity which are based on
fundamental predictive models of human movement for technique selection. This
enables Adaptique to select simple techniques when they are sufficiently
efficient and more advanced techniques when necessary. We show that Adaptique
is more preferred and performant than single techniques in a user study, and
demonstrate Adaptique's versatility in an application.

Abstract: Interactive streetscape mapping tools such as Google Street View (GSV) and
Meta Mapillary enable users to virtually navigate and experience real-world

accessible navigation controls, and conversational speech. With StreetViewAI,
blind users can virtually examine destinations, engage in open-world
exploration, or virtually tour any of the over 220 billion images and 100+
countries where GSV is deployed. We iteratively designed StreetViewAI with a
mixed-visual ability team and performed an evaluation with eleven blind users.
Our findings demonstrate the value of an accessible street view in supporting

Motivation: 盲人和低视力用户在3D数据可视化中因依赖视觉交互而被排除在外，现有方法在非视觉访问支持上不足。

Method: 与BLV研究者共同设计DIXTRAL系统，通过同步听觉、视觉和文本反馈，结合键盘和游戏手柄导航，进行迭代测试。

Result: 多模态交互增强了结构发现和方向感，提升了3D连续标量场的访问性。

Conclusion: DIXTRAL为盲人和低视力用户提供了更好的3D数据访问方式，并为创建包容性3D可视化提供了最佳实践。

Abstract: Blind and low-vision (BLV) users remain largely excluded from
three-dimensional (3D) surface and point data visualizations due to the
reliance on visual interaction. Existing approaches inadequately support
non-visual access, especially in browser-based environments. This study
introduces DIXTRAL, a hosted web-native system, co-designed with BLV
researchers to address these gaps through multimodal interaction. Conducted
with two blind and one sighted researcher, this study took place over sustained
design sessions. Data were gathered through iterative testing of the prototype,
collecting feedback on spatial navigation, sonification, and usability.
Co-design observations demonstrate that synchronized auditory, visual, and
textual feedback, combined with keyboard and gamepad navigation, enhances both
structure discovery and orientation. DIXTRAL aims to improve access to 3D
continuous scalar fields for BLV users and inform best practices for creating
inclusive 3D visualizations.

Motivation: 在线视频内容快速增长，但盲人和低视力观众的可访问性需求未得到满足。专业音频描述（AD）成本高且难以规模化。

Method: CoSight基于Fogg行为模型，提供视觉提示、描述建议、模糊评论提醒和相关参考内容，帮助用户自然添加描述性评论。

Result: 48名视力正常用户的探索性研究中，89%的评论包含视觉描述。BLV观众和专业AD作者认为这些评论虽不及专业AD，但能补充视觉和情感信息。

Conclusion: CoSight为视频可访问性提供了一种低成本、可扩展的补充方案，适合日常用户参与。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content has outpaced efforts to make visual
information accessible to blind and low vision (BLV) audiences. While
professional Audio Description (AD) remains the gold standard, it is costly and
difficult to scale across the vast volume of online media. In this work, we
explore a complementary approach to broaden participation in video
accessibility: engaging everyday video viewers at their watching and commenting
time. We introduce CoSight, a Chrome extension that augments YouTube with
lightweight, in-situ nudges to support descriptive commenting. Drawing from
Fogg's Behavior Model, CoSight provides visual indicators of accessibility
gaps, pop-up hints for what to describe, reminders to clarify vague comments,
and related captions and comments as references. In an exploratory study with
48 sighted users, CoSight helped integrate accessibility contribution into
natural viewing and commenting practices, resulting in 89% of comments
including grounded visual descriptions. Follow-up interviews with four BLV
viewers and four professional AD writers suggest that while such comments do
not match the rigor of professional AD, they can offer complementary value by
conveying visual context and emotional nuance for understanding the videos.

Abstract: Generative AI is being massively deployed in digital services, at a scale
that will result in significant environmental harm. We document how tech
companies are transforming established user interfaces to impose AI use and
show how and to what extent these strategies fit within established deceptive
pattern categories. We identify two main design strategies that are implemented
to impose AI use in both personal and professional contexts: imposing AI
features in interfaces at the expense of existing non-AI features and promoting
narratives about AI that make it harder to resist using it. We discuss
opportunities for regulating the imposed adoption of AI features, which would
inevitably lead to negative environmental effects.

Result: 初步结果显示，Caption生成的标签比人工标注和LLM基线更准确。

Conclusion: Caption有望帮助开发者提供更可操作的无障碍建议，并直接支持屏幕阅读器用户的即时修复需求。

Abstract: We present Caption, an LLM-powered content label generation tool for visual
interactive elements on mobile devices. Content labels are essential for screen
readers to provide announcements for image-based elements, but are often
missing or uninformative due to developer neglect. Automated captioning systems
attempt to address this, but are limited to on-screen context, often resulting
in inaccurate or unspecific labels. To generate more accurate and descriptive
labels, Caption collects next-screen context on interactive elements by
navigating to the destination screen that appears after an interaction and
incorporating information from both the origin and destination screens.
Preliminary results show Caption generates more accurate labels than both human
annotators and an LLM baseline. We expect Caption to empower developers by
providing actionable accessibility suggestions and directly support on-demand
repairs by screen reader users.

Conclusion: 该方法符合真实和基于场景的学习原则，促进学生批判性思考数据。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of scenario-based visualisation examples as a
pedagogical strategy for teaching students the complexities of data insight,
representation, and interpretation. Teaching data visualisation often involves
explaining intricate issues related to data management and the challenges of
presenting data meaningfully. In this work, we present a series of data-driven
scenarios. These concise stories depict specific situations, and are created to
help the educators highlight key concerns in data communication, such as chart
selection, temporal versus categorical comparison, visual bias, and narrative
framing. By grounding these examples in real-world contexts, students are
encouraged to critically assess not only what the data shows, but how and why
it is shown that way. The paper presents a collection of example scenarios,
that educators can use for their own lessons; the work fits with a larger
project on looking at critical thinking in the classroom, and developing
appropriate tools. We also start to abstract principles, from our approach, so
that others can develop their own scenarios for their teaching. Our approach
aligns with principles of authentic and scenario-based learning, using
real-world contexts to foster critical engagement with data.

Motivation: 可视化领域的多样性导致博士生难以理解其碎片化结构并建立跨学科联系，因此需要一门课程帮助他们适应。

Method: 设计并实施了一门面向博士生的可视化技术与方法论课程，包括与其他博士教育活动的互动及实地考察多个研究小组。

Result: 课程在2023年秋季首次开设，提供了实践经验，并为类似课程的改进提供了参考。

Conclusion: 该课程设计有助于博士生适应可视化领域的多样性，并为其他教育者提供了有益的借鉴。

Abstract: Visualization is a heterogeneous field, and this aspect is often reflected by
the organizational structures at higher education institutions that academic
researchers in visualization and related fields including computer graphics,
human-computer interaction, and media design are typically affiliated with. It
may thus be a challenge for new PhD students to grasp the fragmented structure

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨GenAI如何利用其世界知识、创造力和多模态能力推动制图学发展。

Method: 通过案例研究（如符号化、地图评估和地图阅读）分析GenAI的应用。

Result: GenAI在制图设计中有潜力，但在需要深度专业知识或高精度的任务中存在局限。

Conclusion: GenAI为制图学提供了新方向，但需关注伦理和社会影响，并进一步研究。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), including large language models,
diffusion-based image generation models, and GenAI agents, has provided new
opportunities for advancements in mapping and cartography. Due to their
characteristics including world knowledge and generalizability, artistic style
and creativity, and multimodal integration, we envision that GenAI may benefit
a variety of cartographic design decisions, from mapmaking (e.g.,
conceptualization, data preparation, map design, and map evaluation) to map use
(such as map reading, interpretation, and analysis). This paper discusses
several important topics regarding why and how GenAI benefits cartography with
case studies including symbolization, map evaluation, and map reading. Despite
its unprecedented potential, we identify key scenarios where GenAI may not be
suitable, such as tasks that require a deep understanding of cartographic
knowledge or prioritize precision and reliability. We also emphasize the need
to consider ethical and social implications, such as concerns related to
hallucination, reproducibility, bias, copyright, and explainability. This work
lays the foundation for further exploration and provides a roadmap for future
research at the intersection of GenAI and cartography.

train a decision tree on the model's mistakes, allowing it to recognize and
explain where and why it might err. Through a user study on an income
prediction task, we assess the impact of varying levels of information and
explanations about AI predictions. Our results show that AI performance
insights enhance task performance, and conveying AI awareness of its strengths
and weaknesses improves trust calibration. These findings highlight the
importance of considering how information delivery influences user trust and

Abstract: Academia is profoundly influenced by faculty hiring networks, which serve as
critical conduits for knowledge dissemination and the formation of
collaborative research initiatives. While extensive research in various
disciplines has revealed the institutional hierarchies inherent in these
networks, their impacts within GIScience remain underexplored. To fill this
gap, this study analyzes the placement patterns of 946 GIScience faculty
worldwide by mapping the connections between PhD-granting institutions and
current faculty affiliations. Our dataset, which is compiled from
volunteer-contributed information, is the most comprehensive collection
available in this field. While there may be some limitations in its
representativeness, its scope and depth provide a unique and valuable
perspective on the global placement patterns of GIScience faculty. Our analysis
reveals several influential programs in placing GIScience faculty, with hiring
concentrated in the western countries. We examined the diversity index to
assess the representation of regions and institutions within the global
GIScience faculty network. We observe significant internal retention at both
the continental and country levels, and a high level of non-self-hired ratio at
the institutional level. Over time, research themes have also evolved, with
growing research clusters emphasis on spatial data analytics, cartography and
geovisualization, geocomputation, and environmental sciences, etc. These
results illuminate the influence of hiring practices on global knowledge
dissemination and contribute to promoting academic equity within GIScience and
Geography.

### [122] [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Geolocating Colonial Virginia Land Grants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08266)
*Ryan Mioduski*

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在将弗吉尼亚17-18世纪土地专利描述转换为地理坐标时的表现，发现某些模型表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史土地专利描述多为文本形式，限制了空间分析，研究旨在探索LLM在此类任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用六种OpenAI模型，通过直接转换和工具增强链式思维两种范式，与GIS分析师等基线方法对比。

Result: 最佳模型平均误差23公里，优于传统方法；多模型集成进一步降低误差。

Conclusion: LLM在历史地理参考任务中具有可扩展性、准确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Method: 使用遗传算法识别强彩票子网络，无需梯度信息。

Result: 在二分类和多分类任务中，该方法在精度和稀疏性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 遗传算法是识别强彩票子网络的有效方法，同时需注意复杂任务中的评估指标。

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical
multimodal research.

Motivation: 分散式联邦学习（DFL）在边缘计算系统中面临通信瓶颈、资源异构性和数据异构性等挑战，影响模型性能和能源效率。

Method: 提出Hat-DFed框架，将拓扑构建建模为双优化问题，设计两阶段算法动态优化拓扑，并引入重要性感知模型聚合机制。

Result: Hat-DFed在复杂边缘环境中有效平衡了模型性能和能耗，解决了数据异构性导致的性能下降问题。

Conclusion: Hat-DFed为边缘计算系统中的分散式联邦学习提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

TL;DR: XFMNet是一种逐步多模态融合网络，用于多站点水质预测，通过整合遥感降水图像和自适应分解技术，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水质预测因复杂的周期性、非平稳性和生态因素引起的突变而具有挑战性，多站点场景下时空动态建模需求进一步增加了难度。

Method: XFMNet通过自适应下采样对齐时间分辨率，局部自适应分解趋势与周期成分，并利用交叉注意力门控融合模块动态整合时空与生态信息。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，XFMNet显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: XFMNet有效解决了多站点水质预测中的时空动态建模问题，具有鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

TL;DR: MoSSDA是一种新颖的半监督领域自适应框架，通过两阶段动量编码器和混合增强对比模块，解决多变量时间序列分类中的领域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在领域偏移时性能下降，半监督领域自适应（SSDA）是解决方案，但现有方法对时间序列数据的噪声和顺序依赖性敏感。

Method: MoSSDA采用两阶段学习：先通过领域不变编码器学习特征，再通过动量编码器和对比模块增强特征一致性和判别性。

Result: 在六个数据集上，MoSSDA实现了最先进的性能，并通过消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MoSSDA通过两阶段学习和对比模块，显著提升了时间序列分类在领域偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Conclusion: MGSTC在连续预测场景中实现了高精度，为电信流量预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Conclusion: 现代AI的成功可能源于其实现了生物学优化的计算原理，而非仅依赖架构创新。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在高光谱成像目标识别中仅提供单一材料类别预测，且依赖训练库中的材料，缺乏可解释性和灵活性。

Method: 采用概率潜在变量模型学习HSI辐射测量的分布，结合大气和背景估计作为物理条件，使用增强方案和物理损失准则避免训练偏差。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了场景上下文信息，捕捉材料光谱变化，并为候选材料提供概率度量，提升了高光谱成像目标识别的灵活性和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Conclusion: 统计方法适用于已知或建模良好的光谱，而机器学习在测量条件不确定时是更好的选择；统计方法在定量任务中更准确。

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

inconsistencies in agricultural weather data measurements, which are key
attributes for various agricultural decision-making and automation tasks. We

data inconsistencies when perfect weather feeds are unavailable. Cerealia uses
neural network models to check anomalies and aids end-users in informed
decision-making. We develop a prototype of Cerealia using the NVIDIA Jetson
Orin platform and test it with an operational weather network established in a
commercial orchard as well as publicly available weather datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HSA-Net的新框架，通过结合交叉注意力和Graph-Mamba投影器，解决了GNN中深层特征过平滑和浅层细节丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在分子表示学习中存在深层特征过平滑和浅层细节丢失的问题，现有方法无法有效解决。

Method: 提出HSA-Net框架，包含Hierarchical Adaptive Projector（HAP）模块和Source-Aware Fusion（SAF）模块，分别用于分层特征投影和融合。

Result: 实验表明HSA-Net在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HSA-Net通过分层和结构感知设计，有效解决了GNN中的全局-局部权衡问题。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: SHeRL-FL是一种结合分层联邦学习和分割学习的方法，通过中间层表示学习减少通信开销和协调复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中设备计算异构性、资源限制设备负担重、通信成本高和模型聚合复杂的问题。

Method: 整合分割学习和分层模型聚合，引入中间层表示学习，使客户端和边缘服务器独立计算训练目标。

Result: 在图像分类和分割任务中，SHeRL-FL比集中式联邦学习和分层联邦学习减少90%数据传输，比SplitFed减少50%。

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL显著降低了通信和协调成本，同时提高了性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM) 通过模糊评估子句中的字面量，显著减少了所需子句数量、内存占用和训练时间，同时提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 Tsetlin Machine (TM) 的严格子句评估策略需要大量子句才能达到竞争性准确率，限制了效率和灵活性。

Method: FPTM 引入模糊评估机制，允许部分字面量失败时子句仍能贡献部分分数，从而更灵活地匹配模式。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FPTM 显著减少了子句数量和训练时间，同时提高了准确率，例如 IMDb 数据集上仅需每类一个子句即可达到 90.15% 准确率。

Conclusion: FPTM 是一种高效、灵活且鲁棒的 TM 变体，适用于资源受限环境，如微控制器上的在线学习。

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

TL;DR: 本文从第一性原理出发，证明了缩放点积注意力（SDPA）机制的前向传播是退化单侧熵最优传输（EOT）问题的精确解，后向传播的梯度与强化学习中的优势策略梯度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDPA的数学形式通常由启发式方法驱动，缺乏理论依据。本文旨在从优化角度为其提供第一性原理的证明。

Method: 通过将SDPA的前向传播建模为EOT问题，并分析其信息几何特性，揭示了后向传播梯度的数学本质。

Result: 证明了SDPA的前向传播是EOT问题的解，后向传播梯度与优势策略梯度一致，且信息几何特性决定了梯度的形式。

Conclusion: SDPA是一种基于优化原理的机制，前向传播进行最优推断，后向传播实现理性的流形感知学习更新。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

Motivation: 在线广告和推荐系统等应用中，离线数据丰富，如何有效利用这些数据减少在线遗憾成为研究重点。

Method: OOPE算法在探索阶段使用扩展D-最优设计，结合离线数据优化在线遗憾。

Result: 算法在线遗憾为$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$，并首次给出依赖离线数据质量的最小遗憾下界。

Conclusion: OOPE在离线数据质量不同情况下均表现最优，并通过Frank-Wolfe近似进一步优化性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Conclusion: FWPs为神经网络提供了一种动态权重变化的机制，可能成为自然与人工智能研究的重要桥梁。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 现实系统中常存在未观测变量和循环因果结构，现有方法通常假设线性或难以扩展。

Result: 在合成数据和真实基因扰动数据上，DCCD-CONF在因果图恢复和混杂因素识别上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF具有理论一致性保证，适用于复杂非线性循环因果系统。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Method: 采用离散去噪扩散模型在离散空间中生成真实节点特征（如词袋特征），提出DiGNNExplainer进行模型级解释。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，DiGNNExplainer生成的解释更真实且忠实于模型决策，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer填补了异构图解释方法的空白，为复杂图数据提供了更可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输（OT）要求输入测度质量相等，而部分最优传输（POT）放宽了这一限制，但现有POT方法因依赖熵正则化而生成密集传输计划，限制了其在需要稀疏性的应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了一种基于二次正则化的POT方法（QPOT），通过引入二次正则化项，诱导传输计划的稀疏性。

Result: 在合成数据、CIFAR-10数据集以及颜色迁移和领域适应等实际应用中，QPOT表现出更高的稀疏性和优越性能。

Conclusion: QPOT为POT提供了一种稀疏性更强的替代方案，适用于需要稀疏传输计划的应用场景。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Result: 在异构环境中，该方法显著加速了训练，并在相同时间预算下达到甚至超过同步SGD的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至多种异构环境（如云平台和多节点集群），为异构资源的高效利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

Result: 在五个语义分类任务中表现优于全微调、LoRA等方法，训练成本减半且稳定性更高。

Conclusion: 标记驱动的稀疏微调是一种高效且稳定的方法，适用于专业语义分类任务。

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

Result: 在三个标准OCIL基准测试中，该方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: GWM和多级协作蒸馏机制有效平衡了稳定性和适应性，提升了OCIL模型的性能。

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

Conclusion: COGS通过生成式采样提高了TSP求解器的分布鲁棒性，为实际物流问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

Conclusion: TempOpt是一种实用且高效的告警关系学习方法，有助于快速准确地识别根告警。

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Oblivionis框架，用于在联邦学习中实现选择性数据遗忘，以解决隐私和合规性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在LLM中的应用缺乏数据遗忘机制，无法满足GDPR等法规要求。

Method: 提出Oblivionis框架，结合FL和遗忘的双重优化目标，集成多种算法进行评估。

Result: Oblivionis在遗忘效果和模型性能间取得平衡，优于本地训练。

Conclusion: Oblivionis为联邦LLM的隐私合规提供了有效解决方案，并为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数空间先验能更直观地将信念嵌入模型输出，但将其应用于BNNs具有挑战性。

Method: 研究通过可训练激活函数（如Pade函数和分段线性函数）探索如何适应更高复杂度的先验并匹配目标函数分布。

Result: 实验表明，即使单层宽隐层的BNNs，配备灵活的可训练激活函数，也能有效实现目标函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 灵活的可训练激活函数为BNNs实现复杂函数空间先验提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Conclusion: 采用提出的原则可以增强对因果机器学习方法的信任，推动其广泛应用。

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Motivation: 现有方法难以从复杂的频率分量中提取平稳信息，APRNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: APRNet通过振幅-相位重构网络建模相互关系，并引入KLC模块自适应拟合局部函数。

Result: 实验表明APRNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: APRNet能有效捕捉时变模式，提升预测性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Result: 发现持续学习方法对阶段转移攻击高度敏感，现有防御方法效果不足。

Conclusion: 揭示了持续学习模型的安全问题，需进一步研究防御方法。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are
available at https://github.com/mcml-official/CSAT.

Result: 在四个基准问题中，LNN-PINN显著降低RMSE和MAE，误差图进一步验证其精度提升。

Conclusion: LNN-PINN为复杂问题提供了一种简洁有效的架构改进方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

Result: 实验表明，GenCast在多个真实数据集上持续减少预测误差。

Conclusion: GenCast通过整合外部知识和物理原理，有效提升了无传感器区域的交通预测性能。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Motivation: 传统图分类方法依赖静态邻域信息，无法动态调整顶点交互，限制了分类性能。GRAVITY旨在通过模拟物理系统中的自组织行为，提升顶点分类的准确性和语义一致性。

Method: GRAVITY将顶点建模为通过结构邻近性和属性相似性学习的交互对象，生成潜在势场，顶点在势场中向能量高效位置移动，动态调整感受野。

Result: 实验表明，GRAVITY在真实数据集上的顶点分类任务中表现优异，尤其在转导和归纳任务中。

Conclusion: GRAVITY通过动态交互和势场优化，显著提升了顶点分类的性能和语义一致性。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 频域信息在时间序列对抗攻击中具有重要价值，未来需进一步探索。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

Motivation: 注意力机制在Transformer架构中扮演核心角色，其权重信息可以反映模型内部的行为模式。研究旨在探索如何利用这些信息增强模型的可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，注意力权重可以有效地整合到可解释AI框架中，丰富了Transformer模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 注意力权重为模型解释提供了有价值的补充信息，能够增强现有可解释性技术的效果。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Method: 提出HI-LCB和HI-LCB-lite两种策略，基于置信度上界（UCB）框架，将本地模型正确推理的概率建模为其置信度的递增函数。

Result: 两种策略实现了O(log T)的遗憾上界，显著优于现有方法的O(T^{2/3})，且HI-LCB-lite的计算复杂度为O(1)，适合资源受限设备。

Conclusion: 通过仿真验证，所提策略在真实数据集上优于现有HIL方法，为边缘智能系统提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet

search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

Result: 模型堆叠（随机森林）在图神经网络上表现优异或相当，算法性能高度依赖网络特征。元学习算法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 网络特征对算法选择至关重要，元学习算法能有效优化链接预测，适用于大规模网络。

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

Result: 该方法能以更少数据更有效地评估LLM性能，优于当前标准实践。

Conclusion: 研究证明了主动测试在大型模型评估中的可行性和高效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

### [180] [Bridging Formal Language with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to Geometry Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09099)
*Tianyun Yang,Yunwen Li,Ziniu Li,Zhihang Lin,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自然语言推理与形式化语言的几何问题解决方法，通过混合推理轨迹和强化学习优化，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在几何问题解决上表现不佳，主要因为不可靠的图表解释和纯自然语言推理。直接生成形式化程序缺乏中间推理，导致过程不透明且易错。

Method: 结合链式思维（CoT）与形式化语言，模型交替生成自然语言推理和可执行代码。通过监督微调和强化学习优化推理轨迹和程序。

Result: 新模型GF-Reasoner在标准基准测试中准确率提升15%，超越同类7B规模模型及更大的72B模型。推理轨迹更短且清晰。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合自然语言与形式化推理，为未来研究提供了设计选择的详细分析。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

*Shreyas Bhat Brahmavar,Yang Li,Junier Oliva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPIRE是一个通用的神经推理模型，用于处理异构结构化数据的语义推理和预测，支持跨数据集的特征依赖学习，无需额外调整即可泛化到新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据通常具有多样性和不一致性，缺乏统一的模式或特征顺序，这使得构建通用模型变得困难。ASPIRE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ASPIRE结合了基于集合的Transformer（具有排列不变性）和语义接地模块，利用自然语言描述、元数据和上下文示例学习跨数据集特征依赖。

Result: ASPIRE在多样化基准测试中表现优异，支持成本感知的特征获取，并在开放世界环境中适应新数据集。

Conclusion: ASPIRE是实现真正通用、语义感知结构化数据推理的重要一步。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码的校准方法MaC-Cal，通过动态调整稀疏性改善DNN的置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN在安全关键场景中因校准不足可能导致严重后果，现有方法对欠置信误差关注不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方案，利用随机稀疏性动态调整掩码保留率，优化置信度与准确度的对齐。

Result: 实验表明MaC-Cal在校准性能和鲁棒性上表现优异。

Conclusion: MaC-Cal为DNN提供了可靠置信度估计的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

*Jim O'Connor,Jay B. Nash,Derin Gezgin,Gary B. Parker*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SCOPE是一种通过稀疏余弦变换（DCT）降低输入空间维度的进化学习方法，显著提升了游戏任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于游戏状态空间庞大，传统进化方法在游戏领域面临搜索空间指数增长和收敛速度慢的问题。

Method: SCOPE利用DCT将输入状态转换为系数矩阵，通过截断和稀疏化降低维度，保留关键特征，并结合CMA-ES算法学习策略。

Result: 在Atari游戏Space Invaders中，SCOPE性能优于OpenAI-ES、HyperNEAT、DQN和A3C，输入空间减少53%。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过降维和稀疏化有效解决了进化方法在高维游戏状态空间中的挑战，展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning
methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses
a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large
state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of
the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal
patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more
trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.
Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as
increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with
convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a
meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state
into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this
matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the
highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE
with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input
state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple
reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result
through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a
bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by
the CMA-ES algorithm.

TL;DR: 提出一种控制架构，结合轨迹优化和全身控制，通过模型抽象实现人形机器人执行高动态动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人执行高动态动作时因高自由度导致的复杂性问题，避免传统线性化和模型近似方法的性能下降。

Method: 采用轨迹优化和全身控制架构，中间通过模型抽象匹配，基于完整的刚体运动方程。

Result: 在仿真中验证了系统执行高动态动作（如约束和姿态行为）的有效性。

Conclusion: 该架构成功解决了高自由度人形机器人执行复杂动作的挑战，避免了传统方法的性能损失。

Abstract: Endowing humanoid robots with the ability to perform highly dynamic motions
akin to human-level acrobatics has been a long-standing challenge. Successfully
performing these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying
physics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during
execution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high
degree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,
which makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical
workarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,
neither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true
robotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising
trajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching
model abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including
constraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of
motion of the articulated rigid body model. A review of underlying modeling and
control methods is given, followed by implementation details including model
abstraction, trajectory optimization and whole-body controller. The system's
effectiveness is analyzed in simulation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Koopman算子的线性模型预测控制（LMPC）方法，用于四足机器人的在线优化控制，解决了传统线性化模型不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线优化控制四足机器人需要实时适应变化的条件，传统LMPC因模型线性化导致不准确，需改进。

Method: 利用Koopman算子在更高维空间中构建线性模型，保留运动方程的非线性特性，结合LMPC实现控制。

Result: 实验表明该方法能实现高精度跟踪和干扰抑制。

Conclusion: 这是首次将Koopman算子理论应用于四足机器人LMPC，效果显著。

Abstract: Online optimal control of quadruped robots would enable them to adapt to
varying inputs and changing conditions in real time. A common way of achieving
this is linear model predictive control (LMPC), where a quadratic programming
(QP) problem is formulated over a finite horizon with a quadratic cost and
linear constraints obtained by linearizing the equations of motion and solved
on the fly. However, the model linearization may lead to model inaccuracies. In
this paper, we use the Koopman operator to create a linear model of the
quadrupedal system in high dimensional space which preserves the nonlinearity
of the equations of motion. Then using LMPC, we demonstrate high fidelity
tracking and disturbance rejection on a quadrupedal robot. This is the first
work that uses the Koopman operator theory for LMPC of quadrupedal locomotion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的模型，通过相对位置、速度和局部密度调节代理动态，实现灵活、无碰撞的群体行为，并扩展至认知自主系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如Vicsek、Cucker-Smale和Olfati-Saber）在碰撞避免或灵活性上存在不足，限制了其在群体机器人中的应用。

Method: 使用相对位置、速度和局部密度调节代理动态，引入两个可调参数（空间偏移和动能偏移），并扩展至认知自主系统。

Result: 模型实现了灵活、无碰撞的群体行为，并能通过自适应参数调节在群集和聚集行为间切换。

Conclusion: 该模型为多机器人系统（尤其是自主空中群体）提供了鲁棒的基础。

Abstract: Collective behaviors such as swarming and flocking emerge from simple,
decentralized interactions in biological systems. Existing models, such as
Vicsek and Cucker-Smale, lack collision avoidance, whereas the Olfati-Saber
model imposes rigid formations, limiting their applicability in swarm robotics.
To address these limitations, this paper proposes a minimal yet expressive
model that governs agent dynamics using relative positions, velocities, and
local density, modulated by two tunable parameters: the spatial offset and
kinetic offset. The model achieves spatially flexible, collision-free behaviors
that reflect naturalistic group dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the framework
to cognitive autonomous systems, enabling energy-aware phase transitions
between swarming and flocking through adaptive control parameter tuning. This
cognitively inspired approach offers a robust foundation for real-world
applications in multi-robot systems, particularly autonomous aerial swarms.

TL;DR: eIFP-MPC是IFP的优化扩展版本，通过改进威胁优先级、路径生成和动态可行性，提升了在多机器人路径规划中的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IFP在对称配置中表现不佳，容易导致碰撞和死锁，因此需要优化以提升其在复杂环境中的性能。

Method: eIFP-MPC采用时间碰撞启发式优化威胁优先级，通过成本选择的中间点稳定路径生成，并整合模型预测控制（MPC）确保动态可行性。

Result: 仿真表明，eIFP-MPC显著减少振荡，确保无碰撞运动，并提升轨迹效率。

Conclusion: 几何规划器可以通过优化增强，在复杂多智能体环境中实现鲁棒性能。

Abstract: The Iterative Forecast Planner (IFP) is a geometric planning approach that
offers lightweight computations, scalable, and reactive solutions for
multi-robot path planning in decentralized, communication-free settings.
However, it struggles in symmetric configurations, where mirrored interactions
often lead to collisions and deadlocks. We introduce eIFP-MPC, an optimized and
extended version of IFP that improves robustness and path consistency in dense,
dynamic environments. The method refines threat prioritization using a
time-to-collision heuristic, stabilizes path generation through cost-based
via-point selection, and ensures dynamic feasibility by incorporating model
predictive control (MPC) into the planning process. These enhancements are
tightly integrated into the IFP to preserve its efficiency while improving its
adaptability and stability. Extensive simulations across symmetric and
high-density scenarios show that eIFP-MPC significantly reduces oscillations,
ensures collision-free motion, and improves trajectory efficiency. The results
demonstrate that geometric planners can be strengthened through optimization,
enabling robust performance at scale in complex multi-agent environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个大规模EMG-to-Tendon Control数据集，用于解决肌腱驱动机械手控制中的复杂映射问题，并提出了基于扩散的回归模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌腱驱动机械手缺乏直接的运动捕捉数据与肌腱控制的映射，且视觉跟踪方法易受遮挡和误差影响，sEMG传感器提供了一种低成本、鲁棒的替代方案，但现有方法仍难以实现sEMG信号到肌腱控制的准确映射。

Method: 扩展了emg2pose数据集，包含193名受试者的370小时数据，并引入肌腱控制信号。提供了三种基线回归模型，并提出了一种基于扩散的回归模型。

Result: 新数据集和模型框架为肌腱驱动的灵巧机械手操作提供了更准确和可扩展的控制方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为肌腱驱动机械手的控制提供了重要进展，为未来的研究和应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Tendon-driven robotic hands offer unparalleled dexterity for manipulation
tasks, but learning control policies for such systems presents unique
challenges. Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a
direct one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon
controls, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,
visual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and
inaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface
electromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to
capture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a
significant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and
regression-based models in the existing literature.
  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic
hands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193
subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset
incorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model,
addressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three
baseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a
novel diffusion-based regression model for predicting tendon control from sEMG
recordings. This dataset and modeling framework marks a significant step
forward for tendon-driven dexterous robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork
for scalable and accurate tendon control in robotic hands.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFleet, a suite of foundation models designed to support
coordination and planning for large-scale mobile robot fleets. These models are
trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and
interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses
worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct
inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for
multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an
autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual
robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention
between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies
convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full
fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph
neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these
models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on
prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor
models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the
localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also
present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of
larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots with manipulators offer strong mobility and adaptability
for grasping in unstructured, dynamic environments through coordinated
whole-body control. However, existing research has predominantly focused on
static-object grasping, neglecting the challenges posed by dynamic targets and
thus limiting applicability in dynamic scenarios such as logistics sorting and
human-robot collaboration. To address this, we introduce DQ-Bench, a new
benchmark that systematically evaluates dynamic grasping across varying object
motions, velocities, heights, object types, and terrain complexities, along
with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Building upon this benchmark, we propose
DQ-Net, a compact teacher-student framework designed to infer grasp
configurations from limited perceptual cues. During training, the teacher
network leverages privileged information to holistically model both the static
geometric properties and dynamic motion characteristics of the target, and
integrates a grasp fusion module to deliver robust guidance for motion
planning. Concurrently, we design a lightweight student network that performs
dual-viewpoint temporal modeling using only the target mask, depth map, and
proprioceptive state, enabling closed-loop action outputs without reliance on
privileged data. Extensive experiments on DQ-Bench demonstrate that DQ-Net
achieves robust dynamic objects grasping across multiple task settings,
substantially outperforming baseline methods in both success rate and
responsiveness.

Conclusion: AZRA为仿生机器人的情感互动和关系发展提供了动态和细致的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Zoomorphic robots could serve as accessible and practical alternatives for
users unable or unwilling to keep pets. However, their affective interactions
are often simplistic and short-lived, limiting their potential for domestic
adoption. In order to facilitate more dynamic and nuanced affective
interactions and relationships between users and zoomorphic robots we present
AZRA, a novel augmented reality (AR) framework that extends the affective
capabilities of these robots without physical modifications. To demonstrate
AZRA, we augment a zoomorphic robot, Petit Qoobo, with novel emotional displays
(face, light, sound, thought bubbles) and interaction modalities (voice, touch,
proximity, gaze). Additionally, AZRA features a computational model of emotion
to calculate the robot's emotional responses, daily moods, evolving personality
and needs. We highlight how AZRA can be used for rapid participatory
prototyping and enhancing existing robots, then discuss implications on future
zoomorphic robot development.

Abstract: Bulk material handling involves the efficient and precise moving of large
quantities of materials, a core operation in many industries, including cargo
ship unloading, waste sorting, construction, and demolition. These repetitive,
labor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using
large hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this
work, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of
large-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules
for environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and
motion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement
learning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping
locations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the
number of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses
the precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in
movement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material
through dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world
experiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing
on two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck
loading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the
system's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a calibrated digital twin of a wheel
loader. A calibrated digital twin integrates a construction vehicle with a
high-fidelity digital model allowing for automated diagnostics and optimization
of operations as well as pre-planning simulations enhancing automation
capabilities. The high-fidelity digital model is a virtual twin of the physical
wheel loader. It uses a physics-based multibody dynamic model of the wheel
loader in the software AGX Dynamics. Interactions of the wheel loader's bucket
while in use in construction can be simulated in the virtual model. Calibration
makes this simulation of high-fidelity which can enhance realistic planning for
automation of construction operations. In this work, a wheel loader was
instrumented with several sensors used to calibrate the digital model. The
calibrated digital twin was able to estimate the magnitude of the forces on the
bucket base with high accuracy, providing a high-fidelity simulation.

Abstract: Plants need regular and the appropriate amount of watering to thrive and
survive. While agricultural robots exist that can spray water on plants and
crops such as the , they are expensive and have limited mobility and/or
functionality. We introduce a novel autonomous mobile plant watering robot that
uses a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) manipulator, connected to a 4 wheel drive
alloy chassis, to be able to hold a garden hose, recognize and detect plants,
and to water them with the appropriate amount of water by being able to insert
a soil humidity/moisture sensor into the soil. The robot uses Jetson Nano and
Arduino microcontroller and real sense camera to perform computer vision to
detect plants using real-time YOLOv5 with the Pl@ntNet-300K dataset. The robot
uses LIDAR for object and collision avoideance and does not need to move on a
pre-defined path and can keep track of which plants it has watered. We provide
the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Table, forward kinematics, differential driving
kinematics, and inverse kinematics along with simulation and experiment results

Result: 实验表明，GSMR和GSCLO在多种场景下显著优于现有基准，首次实现超低通信成本的RoboMR。

Conclusion: GSMR和GSCLO为动态场景中的机器人混合现实提供了高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Realizing low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems
presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images
through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR
(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a
photo-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS
model, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS
model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this
end, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which
jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or
not) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across
different frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO
problem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm
that reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional
branch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are
presented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method
achieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and
legged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios. For the first
time, it is found that RoboMR can be achieved with ultra-low communication
costs, and mixture of data is useful for enhancing GS performance in dynamic
scenarios.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicles (UAAVs) can operate both in the air and
underwater, giving them broad application prospects. Inspired by the
dual-function wings of puffins, we propose a UAAV with amphibious wings to
address the challenge posed by medium differences on the vehicle's propulsion
system. The amphibious wing, redesigned based on a fixed-wing structure,
features a single degree of freedom in pitch and requires no additional
components. It can generate lift in the air and function as a flapping wing for
propulsion underwater, reducing disturbance to marine life and making it
environmentally friendly. Additionally, an artificial central pattern generator
(CPG) is introduced to enhance the smoothness of the flapping motion. This
paper presents the prototype, design details, and practical implementation of
this concept.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models build upon vision-language
foundations, and have achieved promising results and exhibit the possibility of
task generalization in robot manipulation. However, due to the heterogeneity of
tactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA
models significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in
contact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a
novel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions
are threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder
framework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse
vision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision
transformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we
introduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing
textual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories.
With 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile
datasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned
tactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better
initialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial
improvements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates
with grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with
dexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks. Besides,
OmniVTLA significantly reduces task completion time and generates smoother
trajectories through tactile sensing compared to existing VLA.

Motivation: 现有深度生成模型在模仿学习中生成的运动策略未充分考虑安全性，尤其是在复杂障碍环境中。

Method: 提出PF2MP，通过成功演示同时学习任务策略和障碍势场，并在推理时用势场调制流匹配向量场。

Result: 实验表明，PF2MP在仿真和真实环境中均能显著减少碰撞，同时保持任务成功率。

Conclusion: PF2MP为复杂障碍环境中的安全运动生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching models, have
recently shown remarkable potential in learning complex policies through
imitation learning. However, the safety of generated motions remains
overlooked, particularly in complex environments with inherent obstacles. In
this work, we address this critical gap by proposing Potential Field-Guided
Flow Matching Policy (PF2MP), a novel approach that simultaneously learns task
policies and extracts obstacle-related information, represented as a potential
field, from the same set of successful demonstrations. During inference, PF2MP
modulates the flow matching vector field via the learned potential field,
enabling safe motion generation. By leveraging these complementary fields, our
approach achieves improved safety without compromising task success across
diverse environments, such as navigation tasks and robotic manipulation
scenarios. We evaluate PF2MP in both simulation and real-world settings,
demonstrating its effectiveness in task space and joint space control.
Experimental results demonstrate that PF2MP enhances safety, achieving a
significant reduction of collisions compared to baseline policies. This work
paves the way for safer motion generation in unstructured and obstaclerich
environments.

Motivation: 在层级化讨论中，上级可能主导发言，机器人干预可能平衡参与度。

Result: 机器人行为可能影响发言时间，但未显著差异，且未降低上级满意度。

Conclusion: 机器人可通过调整反馈行为抑制上级支配性，平衡讨论参与度。

Abstract: This study investigated whether robotic agents that deal with social
hierarchical relationships can reduce the dominance of superiors and equalize
participation among participants in discussions with hierarchical structures.
Thirty doctors and students having hierarchical relationship were gathered as
participants, and an intervention experiment was conducted using a robot that
can encourage participants to speak depending on social hierarchy. These were
compared with strategies that intervened equally for all participants without
considering hierarchy and with a no-action. The robots performed follow
actions, showing backchanneling to speech, and encourage actions, prompting
speech from members with less speaking time, on the basis of the hierarchical
relationships among group members to equalize participation. The experimental
results revealed that the robot's actions could potentially influence the
speaking time among members, but it could not be conclusively stated that there
were significant differences between the robot's action conditions. However,
the results suggested that it might be possible to influence speaking time
without decreasing the satisfaction of superiors. This indicates that in
discussion scenarios where experienced superiors are likely to dominate,
controlling the robot's backchanneling behavior could potentially suppress
dominance and equalize participation among group members.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于演示的学习（LfD）依赖大量带标签的专家轨迹，限制了训练数据规模。直接从无标签视频学习是一种有前景的替代方案，但现有方法提取的潜在动作与真实动作互信息低，导致性能不佳。

Method: 引入了一种新框架，利用变分信息瓶颈提取与动作相关的表示，同时丢弃任务无关信息，理论分析表明该方法能最大化潜在动作与真实动作的互信息。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人环境中的实验表明，该方法显著提升了互信息，并持续改进了策略性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为直接从无标签视频学习提供了一种有效方法，显著提升了控制性能。

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations (LfD) typically relies on large amounts of
action-labeled expert trajectories, which fundamentally constrains the scale of
available training data. A promising alternative is to learn directly from
unlabeled video demonstrations. However, we find that existing methods tend to
encode latent actions that share little mutual information with the true robot
actions, leading to suboptimal control performance. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel framework that explicitly maximizes the mutual information
between latent actions and true actions, even in the absence of action labels.
Our method leverage the variational information-bottleneck to extract
action-relevant representations while discarding task-irrelevant information.
We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our objective indeed maximizes
the mutual information between latent and true actions. Finally, we validate
our approach through extensive experiments: first in simulated robotic
environments and then on real-world robotic platforms, the experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances mutual information and
consistently improves policy performance.

Abstract: Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such
as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory
planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and
visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and
adaptability in retail environments.

Abstract: Expressive behaviors in robots are critical for effectively conveying their
emotional states during interactions with humans. In this work, we present a
framework that autonomously generates realistic and diverse robotic emotional
expressions based on expert human demonstrations captured in Mixed Reality
(MR). Our system enables experts to teleoperate a virtual robot from a
first-person perspective, capturing their facial expressions, head movements,
and upper-body gestures, and mapping these behaviors onto corresponding robotic
components including eyes, ears, neck, and arms. Leveraging a
flow-matching-based generative process, our model learns to produce coherent
and varied behaviors in real-time in response to moving objects, conditioned
explicitly on given emotional states. A preliminary test validated the
effectiveness of our approach for generating autonomous expressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注低级抓取稳定性，忽略了功能感知定位和类人姿态，这对下游操作至关重要。

Method: AffordDex采用两阶段训练：第一阶段通过模仿人类手部运动预训练轨迹模仿器；第二阶段通过残差模块和负功能感知分割（NAA）模块调整运动以适应具体物体。

Result: AffordDex在已知物体、未知实例和新类别上均显著优于现有方法，且姿态类人、接触位置功能合理。

Conclusion: AffordDex通过结合运动先验和功能感知，实现了通用且类人的灵巧抓取。

Abstract: A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for
the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus
narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware
positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation.
To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with
two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent
understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage,
a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to
instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual
module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object
instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative
Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally
inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation
process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal
dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and
functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects,
unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.

Result: SDAX使机器人学会爬行、攀爬、跳跃等复杂行为，并成功迁移到真实硬件。

Conclusion: SDAX显著减少人工干预，提升了机器人行为的多样性和适应性。

Abstract: Exploration is crucial for enabling legged robots to learn agile locomotion
behaviors that can overcome diverse obstacles. However, such exploration is
inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,
expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit
generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration
(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering
effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a
diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate
the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization
process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate
that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors
including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as
jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real
hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能从单个不完美演示中泛化到不同场景，而机器人需要大量数据且泛化能力有限。作者认为这是因机器人无法恢复智能行为的潜在解释。

Method: RIR通过分层生成模型推断潜在程序，结合视觉语言模型和规划器评分，生成可执行程序。

Result: RIR在连续操作任务中，仅需一次演示即可推断任务结构并泛化到新场景，优于现有视觉语言模型基线。

Conclusion: RIR为机器人从少量演示中学习提供了有效框架，显著提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately
generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often
require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the
training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to
recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that
these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of
high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this
work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring
these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR
frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language
model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a
planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the
observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over
concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous
manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across
variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one
demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel
settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.

Result: 在LIBERO和ManiSkill2仿真基准测试中表现优异，并在真实任务中展现出高度适应性和稳健性。

Conclusion: GeoVLA通过整合3D信息显著提升了机器人操作的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising approach for
enabling robots to follow language instructions and predict corresponding
actions.However, current VLA models mainly rely on 2D visual inputs, neglecting
the rich geometric information in the 3D physical world, which limits their
spatial awareness and adaptability. In this paper, we present GeoVLA, a novel
VLA framework that effectively integrates 3D information to advance robotic
manipulation. It uses a vision-language model (VLM) to process images and
language instructions,extracting fused vision-language embeddings. In parallel,
it converts depth maps into point clouds and employs a customized point
encoder, called Point Embedding Network, to generate 3D geometric embeddings
independently. These produced embeddings are then concatenated and processed by
our proposed spatial-aware action expert, called 3D-enhanced Action Expert,
which combines information from different sensor modalities to produce precise
action sequences. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments, GeoVLA demonstrates superior performance and
robustness. It achieves state-of-the-art results in the LIBERO and ManiSkill2
simulation benchmarks and shows remarkable robustness in real-world tasks
requiring height adaptability, scale awareness and viewpoint invariance.
