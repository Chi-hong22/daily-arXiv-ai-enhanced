### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了面部关键点检测中广泛使用的Soft-argmax方法，提出了一种基于结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进性能，训练收敛速度快2.2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热图回归方法在面部关键点检测中广泛使用，但argmax操作不可微分，传统使用Soft-argmax作为近似。作者质疑这是否是唯一有效的方法，希望探索替代方案。

Method: 提出了基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，避免了使用Soft-argmax，实现了端到端的可微分训练。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点基准测试中达到最先进性能，训练收敛速度快2.2倍，同时保持更好/有竞争力的准确率。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax并非实现高性能的唯一途径，结构化预测框架提供了有效的替代方案，在保持精度的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [2] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种将图卷积网络(GCN)与Voronoi图相结合的新方法，通过将图像表示为图结构并利用Delaunay三角剖分进行优化，显著提升了图像分类的预处理效率和分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限性，需要一种能够更好建模关系数据的方法来提升图像分类性能，特别是在处理复杂场景和细粒度类别时。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域作为顶点），使用Voronoi图和对应的Delaunay三角剖分对图进行优化，然后应用图卷积网络进行分类。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了显著的预处理效率提升和分类精度改进，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中超越了现有最先进方法，实验结果通过交叉验证得到验证。

Conclusion: GCN与Voronoi图的结合为图像分类提供了新颖的视角，拓展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计统一到2D检测中，仅使用RGB图像就实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要更简单的RGB-only替代方案，直接在类别级别学习，统一目标检测和9自由度姿态估计。

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，端到端训练仅使用RGB图像和类别级姿态标签。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越所有RGB-only方法，接近RGB-D系统性能。

Conclusion: YOPO证明了单阶段RGB-only方法能够高效统一目标检测和9自由度姿态估计，填补了与RGB-D系统的性能差距。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Image-Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splat Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15372)
*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨场景共享码本，将3D高斯溅射压缩到千字节级别，并支持基于图像的场景更新


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法只能压缩到兆字节级别，不适合大规模场景或场景集合的长期归档，且缺乏对归档后场景变化的适应机制

Method: 图像条件化高斯溅射量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用固定共享码本，编码、量化和解码过程联合训练，支持基于解码时图像的场景重建

Result: 将3DGS存储需求降低到千字节范围，同时保持视觉保真度，在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提升了3D高斯溅射的压缩效率，实现了千字节级别的压缩，并提供了对归档后场景变化的适应能力，为大规模3D场景的长期存储提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

### [5] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 统一的人脸防伪装框架，通过对比学习实现同时检测物理和数字攻击，在ACER指标上达到2.10%，让系统更简单高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸识别系统需要分别处理物理和数字攻击，系统复杂度高、延迟大，且容易受到结合攻击的威胁。

Method: 提出Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework，利用自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍图对，学习模态无关的生命力线索。

Result: 在第6届人脸防伪装挑战赛统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上，平均分类错误率(ACER)为2.10%，超过之前方案，计算量轻量(4.46 GFLOPs)，训练时间不到一小时。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一处理不同攻击模态，在保持高性能的同时降低了系统复杂度，具有实际部署的实用性。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at
https://github.com/xPONYx/iccv2025_deepfake_challenge.

### [6] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，通过仅需3-20个采样步骤从无条件扩散模型中高效生成高质量对抗样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型的对抗攻击往往产生低质量图像且计算资源需求大，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但通常需要数百个采样步骤

Method: 在混合步骤区间注入扰动，采用选择性RGB通道策略：对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，对VGGNet源模型，TAIGen对ResNet成功率为70.6%，对MNASNet为80.8%，对ShuffleNet为97.8%；生成速度比现有扩散攻击快10倍，PSNR保持在30dB以上

Conclusion: TAIGen是最高效和最具影响力的对抗攻击方法，防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [7] [Scaling Group Inference for Diverse and High-Quality Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15773)
*Gaurav Parmar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,Kuan-Chieh Wang,Kfir Aberman,Srinivasa Narasimhan,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，通过将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题，在提升样本质量的同时最大化组内多样性，解决了独立采样导致的冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实应用中，用户通常需要获得一组多样化的输出样本（如4-8个图像），但传统的独立采样方法往往产生冗余结果，限制了用户选择和创意探索。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集；采用渐进式剪枝策略提高计算效率。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法相比独立采样基线和近期推理算法，显著提升了组的多样性和质量。

Conclusion: 该框架可广泛应用于文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等任务，使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

### [8] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式细化解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在掩码和RGB双域应用可逆建模，并使用针对性扩散模型优化不确定区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽视觉感知方法主要局限于掩码域，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且存在不确定性处理不足的问题

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题并展开为多阶段深度网络，包含CORE（掩码域可逆建模）、CARE（RGB域可逆建模）和FINE（针对性伯努利扩散模型细化）三个模块

Result: 提出的方法能够有效减少误报和漏报，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性，计算效率高于全图像处理

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆展开网络与生成式细化的独特协同，为构建鲁棒的CVP系统提供了新范式，并扩展为双层优化框架

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GasTwinFormer是一种混合视觉变换器，用于实时监测牲畜甲烷排放，通过创新的Mix Twin编码器和轻量级解码器，在光学气体成像中同时实现甲烷分割和饮食分类，在保持高效的同时达到优异性能。


<details>

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention

while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each
architectural component, establishing GasTwinFormer as a practical solution for
real-time livestock emission monitoring. Please see our project page at

### [10] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow是一个新颖的流匹配框架，通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，显著提升了文本到图像生成的语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的整流流模型基于数据和噪声分布之间的线性轨迹，这种线性性强制零曲率，可能迫使图像生成过程穿过数据流形的低概率区域。研究探索轨迹曲率如何与生成图像和对应标题之间的语义对齐（即指令遵循性）相关。

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，通过直接在流路径中融入曲率引导来学习平滑的非线性轨迹。采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术，惩罚轨迹内在动态的突变。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的广泛实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成方面达到最先进性能，显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线（如Rectified Diffusion）。在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上改进尤为明显。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高图像质量。代码已公开提供。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.

### [11] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和质量对齐实现质量感知嵌入，无需参考图像或主观标签，在合成和真实失真场景下均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要开发不依赖原始参考图像或辅助模态的自监督方法。

Method: 提出HiRQA框架，结合排序学习和对比学习：1）高阶排序损失监督质量预测的关系排序；2）嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致；3）基于结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练的HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化场景（如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊、低光条件）。轻量版HiRQA-S推理时间仅3.5ms/图像，在合成和真实基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiRQA通过自监督的层次化排序和质量对齐方法，解决了NR-IQA的泛化问题，在保持实时性能的同时实现了优异的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于投资组合理论的边缘资源管理策略，用于在时空相关中断情况下保证多视角3D重建的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应急响应、战术场景等关键应用需要近实时3D重建，但边缘环境的动态性和操作逆境会导致相机操作中断，影响重建质量

Method: 采用投资组合理论启发的方法，使用遗传算法解决优化问题，选择相机组合以应对时空相关中断

Result: 在公开和定制3D数据集上验证，相比传统基线策略能更好地保证3D重建的可靠性

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对边缘环境中的时空相关中断，确保多视角3D重建的质量满足要求

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MeSS方法，利用基于网格模型的几何前提和图像滿散模型，生成高质量、风格一致的室外场景，解决了现有模型在视角一致性和几何对齐方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 市政网格模型缺乏现实纹理，限制了在虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶中的应用。图像滿散模型能产生几何对齐的结果，但无法保证视角一致性；视频滿散模型能维持视角一致性，但难以准确跟随预定摄像机路径。

Method: 方法包含三个关键步骤：1）使用级联Outpainting ControlNets生成几何一致的稀疏视图；2）通过AGInpaint组件传播更密集的中间视图；3）使用GCAlign模块全局消除视觉不一致性。同时在网格表面初始化高斯球来重建3D高斯拖尾(3DGS)场景。

Result: 该方法在几何对齐和生成质量方面都超过了现有方法。生成的场景可以通过重新打光和风格转换技术渲染成不同风格。

Conclusion: MeSS方法通过结合网格模型的几何前提和图像滿散模型的优势，成功地生成了高质量、视角一致的室外场景，为虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Motivation: 手术部位感染(SSI)是常见且昂贵的医疗相关感染，现有深度学习研究受限于数据隐私和专家标注成本，缺乏公开数据集和开源筛查工具。

Method: 1) 构建SurgWound数据集；2) 建立包含VQA和报告生成的基准测试；3) 提出三阶段框架WoundQwen：第一阶段用5个MLLM预测伤口特征，第二阶段用2个MLLM进行诊断，第三阶段整合结果生成综合报告。

Result: 创建了首个包含697张手术伤口图像的开源数据集，标注了8个细粒度临床属性，建立了首个手术伤口诊断基准，开发了三阶段诊断框架。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后提供了新途径，填补了手术伤口筛查工具的空缺。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Motivation: 现有的高级驾驶辅助系统(ADAS)通常依赖多种传感器，但仅使用行车记录仪视频输入提供了更经济、更易部署的解决方案。然而，从单一视频输入预测事故更具挑战性，需要更好的时空特征处理。

Method: 提出STAGNet模型，通过改进时空特征提取，并利用循环网络对这些特征进行聚合，相比现有的图神经网络方法有更好的表现。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，STAGNet模型在平均精度和平均碰撞时间指标上都优于先前的方法，无论是在同一数据集上的交叉验证，还是在不同数据集间的训练测试中都表现优异。

Conclusion: STAGNet模型通过改进的时空特征处理和循环网络聚合机制，为基于单一行车记录仪视频的事故预测提供了更有效的解决方案，具有更好的泛化能力和预测性能。

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: TriMM是首个前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过多模态协作编码和triplane潜在扩散模型，有效整合RGB、RGBD和点云等多种模态数据，在少量训练数据下实现高质量的3D资产生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单一模态或3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的范围和模型性能。

Method: 1) 引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2) 添加2D和3D辅助监督提升鲁棒性；3) 基于triplane潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，在使用少量训练数据的情况下实现了与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能

Conclusion: TriMM证明了多模态数据在3D生成中的有效性，为整合其他多模态数据集到3D生成中提供了可行性

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Result: 在五个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有有效性

Conclusion: 提出的中心导向原型对比聚类框架能够有效解决类间冲突问题，减少原型漂移，提高聚类性能

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Conclusion: 双高度无人机协作VLN任务能够有效利用不同高度的视角优势，AeroDuo框架通过分工协作实现了高效的环境理解和精确导航，为复杂外部环境下的自主导航提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

Conclusion: 跳过式采样是预训练传播模型的内在特性，可以通过马尔可夫方式实现高效加速，不需依赖非马尔可夫过程。该方法为传播模型的并行化生成提供了新的视角和解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Conclusion: RATopo通过冗余分配策略实现了数量丰富和几何多样的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by

*Darya Taratynova,Alya Almsouti,Beknur Kalmakhanbet,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPA是一种用于胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的新方法，结合时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，在CHD检测和心功能评估任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超声视频CHD检测方法存在三个主要问题：忽略时序信息、仅限于二分类、缺乏预测校准。这些限制了临床应用的可靠性。

Method: TPA方法使用基础图像-文本模型提取视频帧特征，通过可训练时序提取器聚合心脏运动信息，利用边际铰链对比损失对齐视频表示与类别特定文本提示。引入CVAESM模块学习潜在风格向量来调制嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Result: 在CHD检测任务上达到85.40%的宏F1分数，预期校准误差降低5.38%，自适应ECE降低6.8%。在EchoNet-Dynamic三分类任务上宏F1提升4.73%（从53.89%到58.62%）。

Conclusion: TPA框架成功整合了时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，为胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类提供了更可靠和准确的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: BasketLiDAR是首个结合LiDAR点云和多视角摄像头的篮球运动多模态数据集，提出了新的实时3D多目标跟踪框架，在遮挡条件下仍能保持优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于多摄像头的系统受限于2D数据特性和复杂的3D重建处理，难以实现实时分析。篮球运动中球员快速移动和频繁遮挡使得多目标跟踪特别困难。

Method: 构建包含4,445帧和3,105个球员ID的多模态数据集，开发了基于LiDAR的实时跟踪流水线和融合LiDAR与摄像头数据的多模态跟踪流水线。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法实现了传统纯摄像头方法难以达到的实时操作，在遮挡条件下仍能获得优异的跟踪性能。

Conclusion: BasketLiDAR数据集和提出的多模态跟踪框架为体育MOT领域提供了新的解决方案，成功解决了实时3D轨迹跟踪的挑战。

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG-SEG是一种无需训练的新范式，通过检索增强生成粗掩码作为提示，再使用SAM进行精细分割，在伪装目标检测任务上达到或超越现有方法，且可在个人笔记本上运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪装目标检测方法需要大量训练和计算资源，而基础模型如SAM需要高质量提示且未经微调时表现不佳，手动生成提示成本高效率低。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：第一阶段使用无监督聚类构建检索数据库进行特征检索生成粗掩码作为提示；第二阶段使用SAM2进行精细分割。整个过程无需训练。

Result: 在基准COD数据集上的大量实验表明，RAG-SEG的性能达到或超越了最先进方法，所有实验均在个人笔记本上完成，证明了计算效率和实用性。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种高效、实用的伪装目标检测解决方案，无需传统训练过程，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到视频扩散模型的快速发展引发了隐私、版权和安全担忧，这些模型可能被滥用来生成有害或误导性内容，需要一种有效的方法来防止不良内容的生成。

Method: 采用两阶段处理：选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG），作为一个即插即用模块无缝集成到现有T2V扩散模型中。

Result: 在物体擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除四个任务中，VideoEraser在效能、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面均优于现有方法，平均减少46%的不良内容生成。

Conclusion: VideoEraser提供了一个有效的训练免费解决方案，能够显著抑制文本到视频生成中的不良内容，为解决扩散模型的安全和伦理问题提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部工作机制理解有限，本文旨在通过系统实证研究填补这一空白。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计三种敲除变体（时间、空间、语言到视频），在不同层窗口上应用，设置全局和细粒度两种分析设置。

Result: 发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，形成两阶段处理过程；某些中间层对视频问答有超常影响；时空建模更多依赖语言引导检索而非视频token自注意力。

Conclusion: 这些发现可用于减少Video-LLMs的注意力计算，是首个系统揭示Video-LLMs内部视频处理机制的工作，为未来研究提供可解释性和效率视角。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

Motivation: 深度学习模型计算需求大，传统微调方法更新所有参数可能导致过拟合和计算成本高，需要更高效的迁移学习方法。

Method: 使用进化算法识别需要微调的层子集，选择性微调相关层来优化目标任务的模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过集中微调相关层子集，BioTune减少了可训练参数数量，降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景中快速移动车辆、行人和大规模静态背景带来的3D重建挑战，实现了高质量的场景重建和新视角合成。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Conclusion: 需要开发新的方法来克服互信息最大化的局限性，以更好地捕捉因果关系并提升模型的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Conclusion: SpiVG网络通过结合脉冲神经网络和变分推理，有效提升了视频摘要的信息密度和计算效率，同时减少了噪声影响。

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

Conclusion: 研究为实践中如何选择MAE超参数提供了理论见解，揭示了MAE学习空间相关性的机制。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: 双向时间信息传播方法能有效利用局部和全局时间信息，显著提升红外小目标检测性能

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了三种深度学习人脸检测模型在不同分辨率下的性能表现，发现YOLOv11在高分辨率下准确率最优，YOLOv12召回率略好，MTCNN在实时推理速度方面落后。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的低分辨率图像给人脸检测带来挑战，需要研究输入分辨率对不同检测模型性能的影响，为实际应用提供选择依据。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，在160x160、320x320和640x640三种分辨率下，系统评估YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN三种模型的性能，采用精确率、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95和推理时间等指标。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据不同操作约束条件选择分辨率敏感的人脸检测模型提供了实用指导，YOLOv11适合高精度需求场景，YOLOv12在召回率要求高的场景有优势。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种高效的汽车微观表面缺陷自动检测系统，YOLOv8m-t42模型在准确性和性能方面表现优异，适用于自动保险评估和汽车检测等实时应用场景。

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR是一个基于Transformer的视频到视频时刻检索模型，通过双阶段序列对齐和自监督预训练，在ActivityNet-VRL和SportsMoments数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索任务需要语义帧级对齐和建模查询视频与目标视频之间的复杂依赖关系，现有方法在这方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出MATR模型，使用Transformer架构进行双阶段序列对齐，编码查询和目标视频之间的相关性，并通过自监督预训练技术进行任务特定初始化。

Result: 在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%；在SportsMoments数据集上R@1提升14.7%，mIoU提升14.4%。

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和自监督预训练，显著提升了视频到视频时刻检索的性能，证明了其在复杂视频语义匹配任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需SfM的3D高斯泼溅方法，能够在极稀疏视角输入下联合估计相机位姿和重建3D场景，显著提升渲染质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS依赖密集多视角输入和精确相机位姿，在极稀疏视角下SfM初始化失败导致渲染质量下降，需要解决真实场景中稀疏输入的问题

Method: 使用稠密立体模块逐步估计相机位姿并重建全局稠密点云初始化；提出一致性视角插值模块生成额外监督信号；引入多尺度拉普拉斯一致性正则化和自适应空间感知多尺度几何正则化

Result: 在极稀疏视角条件下（仅2个训练视角）PSNR提升2.75dB，合成图像失真最小且保留丰富高频细节，视觉质量优于现有技术

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3DGS在极稀疏视角输入下的性能问题，无需SfM初始化，在渲染质量和几何结构重建方面均取得显著提升

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGMSNet是一个轻量级医学图像分割框架，通过异质内核和稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支，在保持低计算开销的同时实现了最先进的性能，并在零样本泛化测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轻量级模型在医学图像分割中性能与效率的权衡问题，特别是缺乏全局上下文感知能力和通道冗余问题，以满足资源受限临床环境的需求。

Method: 提出LGMSNet框架，采用局部和全局双多尺度设计：使用异质层内内核提取局部高频信息并减少通道冗余；集成稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息。

Result: 在六个公共数据集上的实验表明，LGMSNet优于现有最先进方法，特别是在四个未见数据集的零样本泛化测试中保持卓越性能。

Conclusion: LGMSNet展示了在资源有限医疗场景中实际部署的潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视角方法ECON在3D人体重建方面存在局限，需要扩展到多视角来提升几何和姿态估计的准确性，同时保持细节重建能力。

Method: 提出联合多视角身体优化(JMBO)算法，跨所有输入视图拟合单个SMPL-X身体模型，确保多视角一致性；使用优化后的身体模型作为低频先验，通过前后视角法线图集成添加几何细节。

Result: 实验结果表明，MExECON相比单视角基线方法在保真度上持续改进，与现代少样本3D重建方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MExECON成功将单视角方法扩展到多视角场景，通过多视角联合优化和法线图融合，实现了高质量的三维着装人体重建，且无需网络重新训练。

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse是一个新颖的多模态图像融合框架，通过自适应跨域协同融合学习解决模态不对齐、高频细节破坏等问题，在多个融合任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种通用的融合框架来提升图像质量和下游应用效果。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行高效多模态融合，实现跨域协同学习。

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务上的实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过创新的频率解耦和跨域融合机制，有效提升了多模态图像融合的质量和通用性，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

Motivation: 从记录的驾驶日志中合成外推视图对于自动驾驶模拟至关重要，但现有方法使用生成先验作为伪真值往往导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，包含基于混合高斯-SDF设计的Road Surface Gaussian表示、使用可学习缩放因子的Far Field Gaussians处理远距离物体，以及基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架来选择性集成生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推视图合成中的关键挑战，为高质量的驾驶场景模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有草图动画方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在困难，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）运动初始化阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；2）运动细化阶段使用基于组的位移网络（GDN）预测组特定位移场，并利用文本到视频模型的先验，包含上下文条件特征增强（CCFE）等专门模块提高时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成复杂多对象草图的高质量、时间一致动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，为处理复杂多对象交互提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet是一个针对高分辨率遥感影像中狭窄道路提取的深度学习网络，通过差分注意力机制和双流解码融合，在复杂场景下实现了精细道路结构分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决狭窄道路因宽度有限、拓扑结构碎片化和频繁遮挡而难以从高分辨率遥感影像中准确提取的问题。传统模型容易过度拟合通用道路宽度，无法有效处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：1）差分注意力扩张提取模块增强细微道路特征并抑制背景噪声；2）双流解码融合机制整合原始特征和注意力调制特征；3）多尺度扩张策略（速率1,3,5,9）减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优异的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中精细狭窄道路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类条件特征分布的显式建模，影响决策边界可靠性和预测校准。

Method: 将TTA重新构建为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类条件似然。引入CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来纠正可能的似然偏差。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)存在频谱偏置问题，倾向于学习低频成分而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用邻域感知软掩码自适应加权，重点关注局部变化强烈的像素；第二阶段进行全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能持续提升重建质量，并与现有INR方法互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，为缓解频谱偏置问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准的计算效率，能够处理95%异常值的情况，并提供了全局最优性的形式化证明

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to

is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof

Motivation: 理解野生动物和人类活动的空间分布对于评估人兽相互作用和制定有效保护规划至关重要，需要多视角监测方法来识别活动区域重叠和冲突程度。

Method: 在尼泊尔奇旺国家公园及周边地区，使用可见光和近红外相机陷阱以及热红外无人机收集图像，构建深度学习模型（YOLOv11s和增强版Faster RCNN）进行自动识别，并进行空间模式分析。

Result: YOLOv11s模型表现最佳，精确度96.2%，召回率92.3%，mAP50达96.7%。无人机热成像提供了补充的空中视角。空间分析识别出明显的野生动物和人类活动热点区域及其重叠模式。

Conclusion: 多视角监测与自动目标检测相结合能增强野生动物监视和景观管理能力，揭示了保护景观内的人兽冲突情况。

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT是一个视频大语言模型，通过扩散时序潜在编码器、对象接地表示和混合令牌方案，显著提升了视频时间感知和实体定位能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在时间感知方面存在局限：时间戳编码隐式、帧级特征连续性差、语言视觉对齐漂移，需要更精细的时间推理和实体定位能力。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）扩散时序潜在编码器增强边界敏感性和时序一致性；2）对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据；3）混合令牌方案提供显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，验证了强大的接地能力。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过创新的时序编码和实体定位机制，成功解决了视频理解中的时间感知精细化问题，为视频LLM的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督方法，通过人工质量评估标签训练评分模型，然后利用评分模型反馈来优化树实例分割模型，在正确识别树实例方面提升了34%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机载激光扫描数据中的树实例分割对森林监测至关重要，但面临数据变化大和精确标注数据获取成本高的问题。

Method: 使用非微调模型或闭式算法获得初始分割结果，由人工操作员进行质量评级，然后训练评分模型对分割输出进行分类，最后利用评分模型的反馈来微调分割模型。

Result: 原始分割模型在正确识别树实例方面提升了34%，同时显著减少了非树实例的预测数量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了弱监督学习问题，但在稀疏林区小树（低于2米）或复杂环境（灌木、岩石等）中性能仍有待提升。

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

TL;DR: 提出CFG方法，通过关键特征引导提升3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，在黑盒攻击场景下无需目标模型信息即可生成有效对抗样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出信息，需要开发不依赖目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于关键特征一致性的观察，提出关键特征引导(CFG)方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏不同架构可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差程度保证不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于现有最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移攻击能力，在黑盒场景下具有显著优势

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，学生模型性能提升+6.68 mIoU和+10.94 mAP，同时加速推理速度

Conclusion: MapKD框架有效解决了跨模态知识迁移问题，实现了高效、低成本的视觉中心在线地图构建

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Motivation: 现有LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏详细的立面元素，而LoD3模型虽能解决此问题但传统方法需要手动建模，难以大规模应用

Method: 使用语义冲突映射生成器(SCMG)生成合成冲突映射进行语义分割，并将纹理模型的分割结果与冲突映射通过置信度分数融合

Conclusion: 该研究推动了自动化LoD3模型重建的进展，为可扩展和高效的3D城市建模铺平了道路

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 提出了MDPR框架，通过多维动态提示路由解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下的微调偏差问题，在多个长尾基准测试中达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差累积。

Method: 构建包含五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库，采用动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合获得稳定预测。

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，动态路由计算开销极小。

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，语义库对尾部类别特别有效。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token和通用查询token之间的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言推理方面取得显著进展，但处理长视频时效率有限。现有视觉压缩方法需要提前编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话场景中不实用。

Method: 提出StreamMem，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token和通用查询token之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，同时保持固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，与查询感知压缩方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频流式理解提供了一种高效的查询无关KV缓存压缩解决方案，在内存受限场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致在长时间序列中对象结构和运动出现累积错误，需要解决时间一致性和结构保持的挑战。

Method: 提出统一的长时域建模方案，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息；利用深度线索构建记忆库；采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在扩散模型和整流流模型上的大量实验表明，WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移并提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过联合建模RGB和感知条件、利用深度线索和分段噪声调度，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和质量。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving

Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样姿态和形状的细节变化方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制，且传统方法中外表面优化再回归内部骨骼的方式导致骨骼与软组织间存在问题依赖关系。

Method: 从60万高分辨率扫描数据学习，显式解耦形状和骨骼基础，在人体骨骼基础上构建网格表示，使用非线性姿态校正来更有效地捕捉复杂姿态。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过解耦形状和骨骼表示，实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制以及独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合，为高保真人体建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene

novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAREdit是一个基于视觉自回归模型的图像编辑框架，通过将图像编辑重构为多尺度预测问题，解决了扩散模型在指令引导编辑中的全局纠缠问题，实现了更精确的编辑效果和更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在指令引导图像编辑中存在全局去噪过程导致编辑区域与整个图像上下文纠缠的问题，会产生意外的伪修改并影响对编辑指令的遵循。自回归模型提供了因果和组合机制的自然解决方案。

Method: 提出VAREdit框架，将图像编辑重构为下一尺度预测问题。基于源图像特征和文本指令生成多尺度目标特征。引入尺度对齐参考(SAR)模块，在第一个自注意力层注入尺度匹配的条件信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，GPT-Balance分数比领先的基于扩散的方法高出30%+。完成512×512图像编辑仅需1.2秒，比同等规模的UltraEdit快2.2倍。

Conclusion: VAREdit通过自回归范式和多尺度预测机制，显著提升了图像编辑的精确性和效率，为指令引导的图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CineScale是一种新颖的推理范式，无需微调即可实现更高分辨率的视觉生成，支持8K图像生成和4K视频生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉扩散模型由于缺乏高分辨率数据和计算资源限制，通常只能在有限分辨率下训练，导致生成高分辨率内容时出现重复模式和低质量问题

Method: 提出CineScale推理范式，针对不同类型的视频生成架构设计专用变体，能够实现高分辨率T2I、T2V、I2V和V2V合成

Result: 实验验证了该范式在扩展图像和视频模型高分辨率生成能力方面的优越性，无需微调即可实现8K图像生成，仅需最小LoRA微调即可实现4K视频生成

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率视觉生成中的重复模式问题，显著提升了生成质量，为高分辨率视觉内容生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

TL;DR: 提出完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，使用图信号处理(GSP)作为核心计算框架，将整个推理流程置于图频谱域中处理，在多个基准数据集上展现出优于现有方法的逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经符号推理模型通常将频谱图方法作为外围组件，缺乏统一的数学框架。本文旨在构建完全基于频谱的推理架构，利用GSP提供数学基础和计算效率，实现符号逻辑与神经推理的深度融合。

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习的频谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理。包括图傅里叶变换、频带选择性注意力和频谱规则落地等完整数学框架。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank、bAbI、CLUTRR和ARC-Challenge等基准推理数据集上实验，相比最先进的神经符号模型，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 图信号处理为构建鲁棒且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础和计算效率优越的底层支撑，证明了完全频谱推理架构的有效性。

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于目标导向状态表示的计算框架，其中世界模型的描述性和规范性方面从智能体-环境交互序列中共同涌现，挑战了传统强化学习中状态表示和奖励函数分离的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算模型（如强化学习）将世界模型分为状态表示（描述性）和奖励函数（规范性）两个独立组件，但可能存在另一种可能性：这两个方面从智能体的目标中相互依赖地共同涌现。

Method: 引入目标导向（telic）状态的概念，定义为目标等效经验分布的类别。通过统计行为策略与期望经验特征之间的差异来提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经维度上的目的性行为，为不同基质中的智能行为提供理论基础。

Conclusion: 基于佛教认识论的目标导向状态表示框架为理解目的性行为提供了一个新颖的视角，挑战了传统世界模型的二分法，具有统一解释多种认知维度的潜力。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型控制群体动画中的代理人移动，通过对话系统和语言驱动导航实现更现实的社交交互和群体行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体动画方法对代理人之间的社交交互和环境影响考虑不足，主要限于导航和固定高层目标推断，而真实人类行为受语言对话的深度影响

Method: 方法包含两个核心组件：对话系统和语言驱动导航。周期性查询以代理人为中心的LLM，条件包含角色个性、角色、渴望和关系，控制代理人间对话生成。然后利用对话内容、个性、情感状态、视觉和物理状态来控制每个代理人的导航和移动

Result: 在两个复杂场景中验证方法，观察到代理人自动进行分组和解散。实验显示该方法作为群体内的信息传递机制，产生更现实的群体模拟，从任何环境设置中自然出现活的群体行为

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合大语言模型和社交交互维度，能够生成更现实的群体动画效果，代理人能够基于知觉输入和进行中的对话做出运动决策，实现了自然活的群体行为演化

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

TL;DR: Collab-REC是一个多智能体框架，通过三个LLM智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成旅游推荐，再通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商，有效提升推荐多样性和平衡性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多小众但优质的旅游地点得到关注。

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体分别从个性化、流行度和可持续性角度生成城市推荐建议，然后通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商和整合，惩罚重复或无关响应。

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，Collab-REC相比单智能体基线显著提升了推荐多样性和整体相关性，能够发掘出常被忽视的小众旅游地点。

Conclusion: 多利益相关者协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有很大潜力，能够提供更平衡、情境感知的推荐，有效解决过度旅游问题并更好地满足用户约束条件。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成逼真图像方面表现出色，但在处理流程图等需要精确空间对齐和符号结构的图表时存在困难，需要一种能够保持布局精度和全局约束的方法。

Method: 采用训练免费的代理系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大型语言模型(LLM)的迭代循环：批评VLM提出定性编辑建议，多个候选LLM生成不同的SVG更新策略，法官VLM选择最佳候选方案。

Result: 在10个源自已发表论文流程图的草图测试中，该方法比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro等前沿闭源图像生成LLM更准确地重建了布局和结构，能够精确组合图元而不插入多余文本。

Conclusion: 该方法通过程序化SVG输出实现了高质量草图到图表的转换，具有良好的可扩展性和人机协作能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

<details>

Motivation: 现有智能体在处理交互生成的大量历史数据时存在挑战，现有记忆模块如MemoryBank和A-MEM存储的记忆内容质量较差，影响召回性能和响应质量。

Method: 设计多重记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，构建一一对应的检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元。检索时匹配最相关的检索单元，获取对应的上下文单元作为响应上下文。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验证明该方法有效性，消融研究验证了记忆单元的合理性，分析了记忆片段数量和存储开销的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MMS系统能够更好地构建高质量长期记忆内容，有效利用历史数据，具有实用价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型作为问答工具时的置信度校准问题，研究推理能力和计算预算如何影响置信度评估准确性

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和行星健康领域，系统评估不同推理预算下的置信度校准表现，比较纯推理与搜索增强生成方法

Result: 推理LLM在专家置信度评估中达到48.7%准确率，但增加推理预算会导致系统性过度自信，搜索增强生成达到89.3%准确率

Conclusion: 信息访问而非推理深度或推理预算是改进知识密集型任务置信度校准的关键限制因素

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

Motivation: 现有MARL系统主要基于显式奖励信号评估团队整体性能，但缺乏在无价值反馈情况下推断个体智能体贡献的方法，需要理解智能体行为与合作动态

Method: 引入Intended Cooperation Values (ICV)方法，基于信息论Shapley值量化智能体对队友工具性赋能的因果影响，通过评估决策不确定性和偏好对齐来测量行动效果

Result: 在合作性和竞争性MARL环境中的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或多样化策略的程度，识别了哪些行为通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动灵活性来有益于团队成功

Conclusion: ICV方法为MARL系统提供了合作动态的新见解，增强了可解释性，能够在没有价值函数的情况下提取与底层价值函数一致的智能体行为洞察

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

Result: 在六个多样化数据集上的综合评估显示，LGT相比传统优化方法取得显著改进，在保持高可解释性的同时实现性能提升。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过语言引导的多智能体协作，有效解决了机器学习配置优化的关键挑战，提供了兼具性能和可解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调技术（如LoRA）在增强LLM能力的同时可能破坏安全对齐，导致不安全行为。现有安全适应方法需要访问基础模型和指令调优检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性，设计SSI指标检测高度集中的潜在不安全更新层，并进行后修剪来降低风险。

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的实验表明，S3LoRA能持续改善安全指标，保持或提升效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a

*Rachel Ma,Jingyi Qu,Andreea Bobu,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Open-Universe Assistance Games框架和GOOD方法，通过LLM模拟用户意图进行概率推理，在开放目标空间中实现高效的目标推断和不确定性估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身AI代理需要推断和响应未预定义的人类多样化目标和偏好的挑战，特别是在开放且不断演变的目标空间中

Method: GOOD方法：使用LLM模拟具有不同复杂意图的用户，通过对话提取自然语言目标，进行概率推理生成目标分布，无需大型离线数据集

Result: 在基于文本的杂货购物领域和AI2Thor模拟家庭机器人环境中测试，使用合成用户配置文件，GOOD方法在LLM和人工评估中均优于无显式目标跟踪的基线

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够有效处理开放宇宙中的目标推断问题，提供丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，为具身AI代理的开放目标交互提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Motivation: 当前AI生成的大量高质量研究内容缺乏合适的发表渠道，传统期刊依赖人工评审难以扩展且不愿接受AI生成内容，现有预印本服务器缺乏严格质量控制机制。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，提供API和MCP接口，实现人类和AI科学家的无缝集成，支持研究提案和论文的提交、评审和迭代改进。

Conclusion: aiXiv为AI科学家建立了下一代开放获取生态系统的基础，加速了高质量AI生成研究内容的发表和传播。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决GUI代理在桌面和移动环境中需要处理多种任务（定位、问答、规划、决策等）的挑战，开发一个端到端的高性能模型。

Method: 采用三个关键创新：1)大规模云端虚拟环境基础设施和自演进GUI轨迹生成框架；2)集成UI定位、规划、动作语义和推理模式的多样化基础能力；3)可扩展的异步强化学习框架和轨迹感知相对策略优化(TRPO)。

Result: GUI-Owl-7B在AndroidWorld达到66.4，OSWorld达到29.4；Mobile-Agent-v3进一步提升至73.3(AndroidWorld)和37.7(OSWorld)，TRPO在线RL达到34.9(OSWorld)。

Conclusion: GUI-Owl和Mobile-Agent-v3为开源GUI代理框架设立了新的性能标杆，通过创新的基础设施、多样化能力和强化学习框架实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzleClone是一个基于SMT的形式化框架，用于大规模合成可验证的数学逻辑谜题数据集，通过编码种子谜题、系统化变体生成和有效性验证机制，构建了83K+多样化验证谜题，显著提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数学逻辑数据集存在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性有限的问题，需要高质量可验证的数据集来增强大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出PuzzleClone框架：1）将种子谜题编码为结构化逻辑规范；2）通过系统变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体；3）通过复制机制确保有效性。构建包含83K+程序验证谜题的基准测试集。

Result: 在PuzzleClone数据集上进行后训练（SFT和RL）后，PuzzleClone测试集平均准确率从14.4提升至56.2，在7个逻辑数学基准上获得一致提升，最高提升12.5个百分点（AMC2023从52.5到65.0）。

Conclusion: PuzzleClone能够大规模合成高质量可验证的数学逻辑数据，有效提升LLM的推理能力，在多个基准测试上展现出显著性能改进。

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过技术哲学视角分析欧盟AI法案，揭示了AI系统中数据的递归价值链动态，提出了基于Simondon哲学的形式化AI生命周期模型，并针对监管盲点提出了具体政策建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分理解AI系统中数据从摄入到部署的递归价值链动态，特别是技术操作和经济逻辑背后的"生成动态"，这导致了监管盲点。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合Simondon技术哲学中的个体化概念，构建AI生命周期的形式化模型（前个体环境、个体化、个体化AI），并引入"未来性"概念来描述AI的自强化生命周期。

Result: 揭示了AI系统中数据的递归生成性和非竞争性本质，识别了技术寡头通过捕获、训练和部署基础设施集中价值和决策权造成的权力不对称问题。

Conclusion: 有效监管需要解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议实施生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度和反对递归重用的权利等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用受到罕见疾病数据稀缺和不可靠的限制，多汗症作为影响2-3%人群的罕见疾病，目前缺乏专门的LLM支持。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）使用前沿LLM生成医学上合理的合成数据；2）在开源基础模型上进行微调；3）临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和共情能力。

Result: 实验表明LLM4Sweat优于基线模型，提供了首个针对多汗症的开源LLM框架，并为其他类似罕见疾病提供了可推广的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了专门针对罕见疾病多汗症的LLM框架，解决了数据稀缺和可信度挑战，为其他罕见疾病的AI辅助诊疗提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估大语言模型在资源约束项目调度问题中推理能力的框架，通过逐步增加约束复杂度来测试模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在高约束条件下的推理可靠性缺乏充分评估，特别是在资源受限的项目调度等复杂规划场景中。

Method: 开发R-ConstraintBench框架，通过在有向无环图中逐步增加非冗余优先约束，并引入停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束来评估模型性能。

Result: 强模型在仅有优先约束的DAG上表现接近上限，但当停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束相互作用时，可行性性能崩溃，约束交互是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在约束交互场景中的泛化能力有限，干净的合成数据性能不能保证在领域接地场景中的迁移效果。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Method: 开发多种优化算法，包括整合差分进化与多目标遗传算法的定制变体，采用约束松弛策略和Kruskal-Wallis统计检验

Result: CR+DES算法在1290个地块的实际案例中实现土地利用兼容性3.16%的提升，MSBX+MO在价格优化上实现3.3%的提升

Conclusion: 包含差分向量的算法显著优于传统方法，约束松弛技术能够在保持实际约束的同时探索更广的解空间，为城市规划者提供基于证据的计算工具

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要使用单粒度记忆，受限于收集经验的质量，导致知识多样性和规划灵活性不足。需要一种更灵活的记忆机制来适应多样化场景。

Method: 提出粗粒度到细粒度的记忆框架：1）在训练任务中将环境信息转化为粗粒度焦点来指导经验收集；2）从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示；3）推理时检索任务相关经验和提示；4）遇到环境异常时进行细粒度关键信息提取和自我问答反思。

Result: 该方法能够更充分地利用记忆，提高LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的适应性和灵活性，特别是在面对环境异常时能够进行有效的计划修正。

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制显著提升了LLM智能体的规划能力，为复杂任务中的记忆利用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

TL;DR: 提出SPW方案统一专家演示和人类偏好两种反馈源，通过相似性搜索实现更精确的信度分配，在机器人操作任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖精心设计的奖励函数，但设计成本高昂。人类反馈是替代方案，但专家演示和偏好各有局限：演示成本高且行为模式有限，偏好易收集但信度分配困难

Method: 引入搜索式偏好加权(SPW)方案：对于偏好标注轨迹中的每个转移，从专家演示中搜索最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似度得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，用于指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW能够实现从偏好和演示的有效联合学习，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于同时利用两种反馈类型的现有方法

Conclusion: SPW方案成功解决了人类反馈中偏好数据的信度分配问题，通过统一两种反馈源实现了更准确的离线强化学习

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架，解决了现有旅行规划系统无法处理隐式查询、忽略环境因素和用户偏好、缺乏详细POI信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的旅行规划系统存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略多样化的环境因素和用户偏好，限制计划的可行性；3）只能生成基本的POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一站式计划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集，支持显式和隐式查询的决策制定，包含修订需求，具备环境感知能力以确保现实场景下的可行性，并整合详细的POI信息。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA。

Result: 实验显示，现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，表明现实世界旅行规划极具挑战性。相比之下，TGMA框架实现了2.72%的显著性能提升。

Conclusion: TGMA框架为现实世界旅行规划提供了有前景的方向，通过多智能体方法和综合数据集解决了现有系统的局限性。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化和开放式推理方面存在局限，需要一种能够统一处理心电图信号和自然语言的解决方案。

Method: 使用独立于导联的编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表，通过自回归ECG预测预训练和指令微调来桥接模态差距。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多个任务上实现了强劲性能，并在分布外设置中保持了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示集成到LLM中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了更强大的自动化工具。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Motivation: 在许多规划应用中，我们需要找到既能实现目标又尽可能少地改变初始状态的计划，这种平衡行动成本和状态修改的需求促使了计划干扰概念的研究。

Method: 定义了多种基于规划的编译方法，将原始规划任务重新表述为能够同时优化行动成本总和和计划干扰的联合优化问题。

Conclusion: 计划干扰是一个有价值的规划概念，通过适当的任务重新表述，可以有效地生成在行动成本和状态修改之间取得平衡的优化计划。

Abstract: In many planning applications, we might be interested in finding plans that
minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define
various planning-based compilations that aim to jointly optimize both the sum
of action costs and plan disruption. Experimental results in different
benchmarks show that the reformulated task can be effectively solved in
practice to generate plans that balance both objectives.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating
and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the
overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in business
applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic
planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate
operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market
environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across
organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent

environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended
Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a
generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a
multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.
Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,
supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.
Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate
BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,
client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with
high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both
solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies
with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in
AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate

*Yekun Zhu,Guang Chen,Chengjun Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该文章提出Think in Blocks框架，通过将思维过程分解为可调数量的块来实现动态调整推理深度，避免过度思考导致的计算浪费和响应慢问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然带有链式思维的大语言模型在复杂逻辑推理任务上表现优异，但过长的思维链可能导致过度思考，造成计算资源浪费和响应速度下降。

Method: 构建块状结构的推理范式，模型首先预测推理预算（块数），然后按块分配思维过程。通过三阶段训练流程：监督微调、奖励导向的直接偏好优化和强化学习来训练适应性模型。

Result: 模型能够根据任务复杂性动态调整推理深度，在推理时利用显式块数来灵活控制链式思维长度。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架提供了一种有效的方法来解决LLM过度思考问题，通过动态推理深度调整提高了计算效率和响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Motivation: 随着自主AI代理的发展，研究其合作行为倾向变得越来越重要。受超加性合作理论启发，该理论认为重复互动和群体间竞争是人类合作倾向的原因。

Method: 设计虚拟锦标赛，将语言模型代理分组进行囚徒困境游戏，模拟团队内部动态和外部竞争环境。

Result: 发现内部团队动态和外部竞争的结合显著提高了整体和初始一次性合作水平。

Conclusion: 为语言模型在复杂社会场景中制定策略提供了新框架，证明群体间竞争可以反直觉地导致更多合作行为，对设计未来多代理AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Method: 1) 在SQA3D基准上采用组合迭代进化方法生成更复杂问题；2) 对大语言模型进行微调使其更熟练使用3D工具；3) 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)直接优化模型生成的工具链策略。

Result: 该方法增强了LLMs在复杂3D场景推理中的工具使用能力，提高了在复杂任务中的准确性。

Conclusion: DeepThink3D通过生成更复杂问题和优化工具链策略，有效提升了大语言模型在3D场景复杂推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要开发能够正式验证学习策略鲁棒性和安全性的框架。

Method: 将RL智能体与环境组合作为离散时间自治动力系统进行分析，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并引入MBR、ASAS、TASAS等量化指标来测量策略的安全边界。

Result: 实验表明该框架能够提供全面可解释的策略行为评估，成功识别出仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架为强化学习策略提供了形式化的安全验证方法，能够识别不安全区域的安全屏障和系统的收敛特性，为安全关键应用中的RL部署提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Motivation: 为了解决传统AI开发中需要手动设计提示词的问题，提供一个声明式语言让开发者专注于数据建模而非提示工程。

Method: 将智能体从逻辑流中抽象出来，在数据类型内部使用智能体实现逻辑转换，通过LLM执行类型连接时的逻辑转换。

Conclusion: Agentics框架为AI开发提供了新的数据建模视角，通过声明式方法和逻辑转换机制有效提升了开发效率和系统性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

TL;DR: HDM是ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势，已成功适配到Lisp ACT-R，使现有模型无需重大修改即可运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发向量符号替代方案来改进ACT-R的声明性记忆系统，获得更好的可扩展性和相似性处理能力，同时保持与现有模型的兼容性。

Method: 将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R，开发基于向量的常见ACT-R函数，建立文本处理管道，创建基于向量表示的令牌检索机制。

Result: 初步结果表明HDM保持了向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块即可召回），同时使先前ACT-R模型只需很少修改即可工作。

Conclusion: HDM成功实现了向量符号优势与现有ACT-R模型的兼容性，未来将改进时间上下文表示并开发基于实例学习的决策模型来进一步测试。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on
instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It
features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables,
created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data
semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table
image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based
solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as
JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output
format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including
comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation,
and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers
follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based
evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained
benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning
tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and
multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare
their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML
algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to
develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3
case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,
Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study
(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of
cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human
participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our
second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a
novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the
Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we
show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans
on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of
hierarchical tasks. The library is available at

Motivation: 随着AI应用加速普及，需要理解和减轻AI服务的环境影响，但此前缺乏在生产环境中测量AI服务环境指标的研究。

Method: 提出并执行全面的测量方法，在谷歌大规模AI生产环境中测量AI推理工作负载的能耗、碳排放和水消耗，涵盖完整的AI服务基础设施栈。

Result: Gemini Apps文本提示中位数能耗0.24Wh，比看电视9秒还低；水消耗0.26mL（约5滴水）。谷歌的软件效率提升和清洁能源采购使能耗降低33倍，碳足迹减少44倍。

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务环境影响相对较低，但仍需持续关注。全面测量AI服务环境指标对于准确比较模型性能和激励全栈效率提升至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

Motivation: 防止人类与AI代理形成有害的假社交关系，这种关系可能对人类健康造成严重甚至悲剧性影响，但防止此类问题很养扰因为假社交算子通常在私密对话中渐进形成

Method: 重新利用最先进的语言模型构建简单的响应评估框架，实时评估进行中对话的假社交算子，使用30个合成对话的小数据集进行测试

Conclusion: 评估代理提供了一种可行的解决方案来预防假社交关系的形成，这些发现为该方法的可行性提供了初步证据

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Conclusion: LitForager成功填补了沉浸式环境中信息觅食研究的空白，为完整的文献感知构建工作流程提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Exploring and comprehending relevant academic literature is a vital yet
challenging task for researchers, especially given the rapid expansion in
research publications. This task fundamentally involves sensemaking -
interpreting complex, scattered information sources to build understanding.
While emerging immersive analytics tools have shown cognitive benefits like
enhanced spatial memory and reduced mental load, they predominantly focus on
information synthesis (e.g., organizing known documents). In contrast, the
equally important information foraging phase - discovering and gathering
relevant literature - remains underexplored within immersive environments,
hindering a complete sensemaking workflow. To bridge this gap, we introduce
LitForager, an interactive literature exploration tool designed to facilitate
information foraging of research literature within an immersive sensemaking
workflow using network-based visualizations and multimodal interactions.
Developed with WebXR and informed by a formative study with researchers,
LitForager supports exploration guidance, spatial organization, and seamless
transition through a 3D literature network. An observational user study with 15
researchers demonstrated LitForager's effectiveness in supporting fluid
foraging strategies and spatial sensemaking through its multimodal interface.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limited attention given to blind users as content
creators in Content Management Systems (CMS), a gap that remains under-explored
in web accessibility research. For blind authors, effective interaction with
CMS platforms requires more than technical compliance; it demands interfaces
designed with semantic clarity, predictable navigation, and meaningful feedback
for screen reader users. This study investigates the accessibility barriers
blind users face when performing key tasks, such as page creation, menu
editing, and image publishing, using CMS platforms. A two-fold evaluation was
conducted using automated tools and manual usability testing with three blind
and one sighted participant, complemented by expert analysis based on the
Barrier Walkthrough method. Results showed that block-based interfaces were
particularly challenging, often marked as accessible by automated tools but
resulting in critical usability issues during manual evaluation. The use of a
text-based editor, the integration of AI-generated image descriptions, and
training aligned with screen reader workflows, significantly improved usability
and autonomy. These findings underscore the limitations of automated
assessments and highlight the importance of user-centered design practices.
Enhancing CMS accessibility requires consistent navigation structures, reduced
reliance on visual interaction patterns, and the integration of AI tools that
support blind content authors throughout the content creation process.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的对话式数据库查询工具存在用户意图误解、生成幻觉内容、缺乏有效反馈机制等问题，影响了系统的可靠性和实用性。

Method: 提出QueryGenie交互系统，采用增量推理、实时验证和响应式交互机制，允许用户迭代优化查询逻辑并确保与意图对齐。

Result: 系统能够提供更透明和可控的查询体验，用户可以通过交互方式指导查询生成过程。

Conclusion: QueryGenie通过创新的交互设计解决了LLM驱动查询系统中的关键问题，提升了查询生成的可控性和可靠性。

Abstract: Conversational user interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) have
significantly lowered the technical barriers to database querying. However,
existing tools still encounter several challenges, such as misinterpretation of
user intent, generation of hallucinated content, and the absence of effective
mechanisms for human feedback-all of which undermine their reliability and
practical utility. To address these issues and promote a more transparent and
controllable querying experience, we proposed QueryGenie, an interactive system
that enables users to monitor, understand, and guide the LLM-driven query
generation process. Through incremental reasoning, real-time validation, and
responsive interaction mechanisms, users can iteratively refine query logic and
ensure alignment with their intent.

TL;DR: 开发了ReviseMate交互式系统来帮助研究者更有效地消化和整合审稿人反馈，通过用户研究和实地部署验证了其优于基线方法的有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统审稿反馈消化过程存在耗时、阅读疲劳和需要全面分析技能等挑战，现有工具缺乏针对性的支持和上下文帮助

Method: 通过访谈和故事板开发了ReviseMate交互式系统，进行了控制用户研究(N=31)和实地部署(N=6)来验证效果

Result: 用户研究表明ReviseMate优于基线方法，获得积极的用户交互反馈，实地部署进一步验证了其在真实场景中的有效性

Conclusion: 交互式工具在稿件审阅过程中显著增强审稿反馈的消化和整合方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Effectively assimilating and integrating reviewer feedback is crucial for
researchers seeking to refine their papers and handle potential rebuttal phases
in academic venues. However, traditional review digestion processes present
challenges such as time consumption, reading fatigue, and the requisite for
comprehensive analytical skills. Prior research on review analysis often
provides theoretical guidance with limited targeted support. Additionally,
general text comprehension tools overlook the intricate nature of
comprehensively understanding reviews and lack contextual assistance. To bridge
this gap, we formulated research questions to explore the authors' concerns and
methods for enhancing comprehension during the review digestion phase. Through
interviews and the creation of storyboards, we developed ReviseMate, an
interactive system designed to address the identified challenges. A controlled
user study (N=31) demonstrated the superiority of ReviseMate over baseline
methods, with positive feedback regarding user interaction. Subsequent field
deployment (N=6) further validated the effectiveness of ReviseMate in
real-world review digestion scenarios. These findings underscore the potential
of interactive tools to significantly enhance the assimilation and integration
of reviewer feedback during the manuscript review process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过在企业BI会议这种实际场景中评估Tableau visionOS沉浸式分析应用，获得多样化反馈，了解HMD在企业数据分析中的潜在价值和实用性挑战。

Method: 在大型企业BI会议上进行形式化评估，线下调研22名参与者，收集Tableau visionOS的可用性反馈以及对HMD在BI工作流中应用潜力的广泛视角。

Result: 发现评估时需要平衡新鲜体验与实际工作流应用性的关系，建议整合定性和定量测量方法，考虑HMD下3D表现和界面的独特交互模式。

Conclusion: 为沉浸式分析领域提供了来自企业实践的评估方法视角，强调需要发展适应HMD技术特点的新评估框架来有效评估其在企业环境中的实际价值。

Abstract: We reflect on an evaluation of an immersive analytics application (Tableau
for visionOS) conducted at a large enterprise business intelligence (BI)
conference. Conducting a study in such a context offered an opportunistic
setting to gather diverse feedback. However, this setting also highlighted the
challenge of evaluating usability while also assessing potential utility, as
feedback straddled between the novelty of the experience and the practicality
of the application in participants' analytical workflows. This formative
evaluation with 22 participants allowed us to gather insights with respect to
the usability of Tableau for visionOS, along with broader perspectives on the
potential for head-mounted displays (HMDs) to promote new ways to engage with
BI data. Our experience suggests a need for new evaluation considerations that
integrate qualitative and quantitative measures and account for unique
interaction patterns with 3D representations and interfaces accessible via an
HMD. Overall, we contribute an enterprise perspective on evaluation
methodologies for immersive analytics.

TL;DR: GenTune是一个帮助设计师理解AI生成提示与图像内容映射关系的系统，通过可视化关联和精确编辑来解决现有工作流中的提示理解和全局一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 娱乐行业环境设计师在使用生成式AI时面临两个主要挑战：LLM生成长提示难以理解和修改特定视觉元素的关键词；局部修复(inpainting)难以保持全局一致性。

Method: 开发GenTune系统，让设计师能够选择生成图像中的任何元素，追溯对应的提示标签，并通过修改这些标签来指导精确且全局一致的图像优化。

Result: 在20名设计师的总结性研究中，GenTune相比现有方法显著提高了提示-图像理解、优化质量和效率，以及整体满意度（所有p<0.01）。实地研究进一步验证了其在实际工作环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: GenTune通过澄清AI生成提示与图像内容的映射关系，有效增强了人机协作，解决了设计师在使用生成式AI时遇到的关键挑战，为创意工作流程提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Environment designers in the entertainment industry create imaginative 2D and
3D scenes for games, films, and television, requiring both fine-grained control
of specific details and consistent global coherence. Designers have
increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on
large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image
generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting.
However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1)
the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate
the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while
inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency
and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that
enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to
image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a
generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise
those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a
summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image
comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction
(all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two
studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能腕带由于佩戴者手臂姿势变化导致不同区域可见性不同，这给数据可视化设计带来独特挑战，需要研究如何在不同使用场景下优化可视化布局

Method: 采用纸质原型进行创意工作坊，聚焦办公室工作、休闲散步、骑行和驾驶四种使用场景，分析不同手臂姿势下的空间布局和可视化设计需求

Result: 研究发现可视化设计需要根据数据类型和手臂姿势进行调整，参与者强烈偏好能够适应手臂运动的响应式可视化设计

Conclusion: 智能腕带的数据可视化设计必须考虑佩戴者的动态手臂姿势，响应式设计是未来发展的关键方向

Abstract: We present the results of an in-situ ideation workshop for designing data
visualizations on smart wristbands that can show data around the entire wrist
of a wearer. Wristbands pose interesting challenges because the visibility of
different areas of the band depends on the wearer's arm posture. We focused on
four usage scenarios that lead to different postures: office work, leisurely
walks, cycling, and driving. As the technology for smart wristbands is not yet
commercially available, we conducted a paper-based ideation exercise that
showed how spatial layout and visualization design on smart wristbands may need
to vary depending on the types of data items of interest and arm postures.
Participants expressed a strong preference for responsive visualization designs
that could adapt to the movement of wearers' arms. Supplemental material from
the study is available here: https://osf.io/4hrca/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间媒体技术主要关注静态内容的捕获和回放，缺乏对体验语义结构和交互性的标准化描述方法，无法实现与用户环境的动态适配

Method: 基于三个核心原语：事件原语（语义场景图表示）、关键帧原语（高效数据访问）、播放原语（用户驱动的自适应交互回放），构建三阶段处理流程

Result: 能够将记录的体验转换为独特的自适应混合现实体验，其时空结构能够动态适应新环境，叙事可通过用户实时输入改变

Conclusion: 该框架使数字记忆和记录事件超越被动2D/3D视频，发展为沉浸式、空间集成的群体体验，为培训、文化遗产和交互式叙事开辟新范式

Abstract: We propose the Spatio-Temporal Mixed and Augmented Reality Experience
Description (MAR-ED), a novel framework to standardize the representation of
past events for interactive and adaptive playback in a user's present physical
space. While current spatial media technologies have primarily focused on
capturing or replaying content as static assets, often disconnected from the
viewer's environment or offering limited interactivity, the means to describe
an experience's underlying semantic and interactive structure remains
underexplored. We propose a descriptive framework called MAR-ED based on three
core primitives: 1) Event Primitives for semantic scene graph representation,
2) Keyframe Primitives for efficient and meaningful data access, and 3)
Playback Primitives for user-driven adaptive interactive playback of recorded
MAR experience. The proposed flowchart of the three-stage process of the
proposed MAR-ED framework transforms a recorded experience into a unique
adaptive MAR experience during playback, where its spatio-temporal structure
dynamically conforms to a new environment and its narrative can be altered by
live user input. Drawing on this framework, personal digital memories and
recorded events can evolve beyond passive 2D/3D videos into immersive,
spatially-integrated group experiences, opening new paradigms for training,
cultural heritage, and interactive storytelling without requiring complex,
per-user adaptive rendering.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience
and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the
traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational
capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of
these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by
diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic
categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive
modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis,
systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the
native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal
frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical
foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges
such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world
applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work
not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but
accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable,
interpretable, and online actionable solutions.

Motivation: HCI研究人员和实践者在基于强化学习的生物力学模拟中经常因奖励函数设计不当而浪费计算时间进行试错调整，需要系统化的指导来简化这一过程。

Method: 通过系统分析努力最小化、任务完成奖励和目标接近激励这三个奖励组件对典型HCI任务（指向、跟踪和选择反应）的影响，进行广泛的参数敏感性分析。

Result: 研究发现接近激励对于引导运动至关重要，完成奖励确保任务成功，努力项在适当缩放时有助于改善运动规律性。研究还确定了这些奖励组件权重对任务成功率和完成时间的敏感性。

Conclusion: 研究提出了实用的奖励函数设计指南，使HCI研究人员无需强化学习专业知识即可创建合理的生物力学模拟，并在远程控制和键盘输入任务上验证了其有效性，推动了基于模拟的交互设计和评估在HCI领域的应用。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is critical for reinforcement
learning-based biomechanical simulations, yet HCI researchers and practitioners
often waste (computation) time with unintuitive trial-and-error tuning. This
paper demystifies reward function design by systematically analyzing the impact
of effort minimization, task completion bonuses, and target proximity
incentives on typical HCI tasks such as pointing, tracking, and choice
reaction. We show that proximity incentives are essential for guiding movement,
while completion bonuses ensure task success. Effort terms, though optional,
help refine motion regularity when appropriately scaled. We perform an
extensive analysis of how sensitive task success and completion time depend on
the weights of these three reward components. From these results we derive
practical guidelines to create plausible biomechanical simulations without the
need for reinforcement learning expertise, which we then validate on remote
control and keyboard typing tasks. This paper advances simulation-based
interaction design and evaluation in HCI by improving the efficiency and
applicability of biomechanical user modeling for real-world interface
development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层安全强化学习框架，将伦理考量整合到自动驾驶决策中，通过伦理风险成本和优先经验回放机制，在真实交通场景中实现更好的伦理决策和驾驶性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要嵌入强大的伦理推理能力，以在常规和紧急操作中做出道德决策，这是实现广泛采用的关键。

Method: 分层安全强化学习框架：决策层使用包含碰撞概率和伤害严重性的复合伦理风险成本训练Safe RL智能体；执行层采用多项式路径规划和PID+Stanley控制器实现平滑轨迹；动态优先经验回放机制强化高风险事件学习。

Result: 在包含多种车辆、骑行者和行人的真实交通数据集上验证，相比基线方法在降低伦理风险和保持驾驶性能方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 这是首个通过安全强化学习在真实场景中研究自动驾驶伦理决策的工作，结合形式控制理论和数据驱动学习，有望推动复杂人车混行环境中的伦理问责自治系统发展。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

TL;DR: 个性化肺癌风险预测系统，通过FAISS相似性搜索找到最相似的病人群体，然后用LLM根据该群体的模型表现选择最优预测模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同病人群体和临床环境存在显著差异，没有单一模型能在所有群体中都表现最佳，需要个性化的风险预测方案

Method: 两阶段流程：1）使用FAISS相似性搜索在9个多样化真实世界群体中找到最相似的病人群体；2）用LLM分析找到的群体和其模型表现指标，从8个代表性模型中推荐最优预测算法

Result: 设计了一个动态、根据群体特征个性化选择模型的风险预测系统

Conclusion: 该两阶段流程能够在多样化临床病人群体中实现灵活的、根据群体特征驱动的模型选择，为实际肺癌筛查中的个体化风险评估提供了可行路径

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test

Motivation: 解决帕金森病进展预测中症状演化复杂性和时序依赖建模不足的问题，需要同时考虑症状间的结构关系和疾病发展的动态时序特征。

Method: 使用图神经网络建模多模态临床症状的结构关系，Transformer建模时序特征，设计结构感知门控机制动态融合结构和时序信息，包含图构建、时序编码和预测输出三个模块。

Conclusion: 该框架具有良好的泛化能力和结构可扩展性，为帕金森病等慢性进展性疾病的智能建模提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS模型在文本分类中缺乏分层混合结构，搜索空间无限制导致过大且冗余，现有RL模型无法有效导航搜索空间，平面架构搜索导致搜索空间混乱难以遍历。

Method: 引入架构模板组织搜索空间，基于领域特定线索设计搜索空间，采用Q-learning动态调整变异策略，基于先前迭代的性能反馈实现更有效的搜索空间遍历。

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM方法通过分层组织和自适应变异策略，能够有效探索多样化架构配置，显著提升文本分类任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO算法虽然简单且训练稳定，但容易出现过拟合和崩溃问题，需要一种更稳健的偏好对齐方案。

Method: 1）梯度解耦：用绝对差损失替代log-sigmoid函数；2）偏移约束和正则化：保持被选响应质量；3）可控拒绝压制：通过梯度分离和可调系数线性控制拒绝概率。

Result: 在多种任务上都表现更优，包括普通文本任务、数学任务和文本转语音任务，证明了LPO的稳健性和可调性。

Conclusion: LPO作为一种稳健且可调的偏好对齐范式，有效解决了DPO的限制，并开源了源代码、模型和训练数据。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads是一个面向广告推荐的全表征多粒度迁移框架，通过同时迁移用户表征、物品表征和交叉表征，并采用多粒度迁移机制，显著提升了推荐效果和商业价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅迁移用户表征，忽略了物品表征和用户-物品交叉表征的价值，且迁移方式单一，无法有效弥合上游预训练与下游应用之间的差距。

Method: 提出LFM4Ads框架：1）全面迁移用户、物品和交叉三种表征；2）识别最佳提取层并聚合交叉表征；3）采用多粒度迁移机制：特征级非线性适配器、模块级同构交互模块和模型级独立检索。

Result: 在腾讯工业级广告平台成功部署，处理每日数百亿样本，保持TB级模型参数。自2024年Q4上线以来，在微信朋友圈和视频号等主要场景完成10+次成功上线，整体平台GMV提升2.45%。

Conclusion: LFM4Ads通过全表征迁移和多粒度机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在工业规模广告推荐中取得了显著的业务提升和经济效益。

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

TL;DR: 提出了一种去中心化的对抗攻击检测器，用于连续动作空间的协作多智能体强化学习系统，通过深度神经网络建模智能体正常行为的多元高斯分布，使用CUSUM算法实时检测异常行为。


<details>

Motivation: 解决协作多智能体强化学习系统在连续动作空间中面临的对抗攻击检测问题，需要一种仅依赖局部观测的去中心化检测方案。

Method: 使用深度神经网络近似智能体正常行为的参数化多元高斯分布，基于预测密度函数定义正态性评分，采用双侧CUSUM程序实时检测评分偏离均值的异常行为。

Result: 在多个多智能体PettingZoo基准测试中，针对不同最先进攻击方法进行评估，检测效果显著，对最具影响力攻击的AUC-ROC分数超过0.95。

Conclusion: 该方法在连续动作空间的多智能体环境中有效检测对抗攻击，性能优于离散对应方法，在所有评估环境中均表现出色。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

TL;DR: CuMoLoS-MAE是一种课程引导的蒙特卡洛随机集成掩码自编码器，用于修复大气遥感数据中的精细特征，同时提供像素级不确定性估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大气遥感数据修复方法会模糊精细尺度结构，而深度学习模型缺乏置信度估计，需要一种既能恢复精细特征又能量化不确定性的方法

Method: 采用课程引导的掩码比例训练策略，让ViT解码器从逐渐稀疏的上下文中重建；推理时通过蒙特卡洛随机掩码实现来近似后验预测

Result: 能够恢复上升/下沉气流核心、切变线和小涡旋等精细尺度特征，提供高保真重建和像素级不确定性地图

Conclusion: 该方法支持增强的对流诊断、实时数据同化和改进的长期气候再分析

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Motivation: 神经算子的理论分析表明需要大量参数来解决算子学习问题，这与实验证据相矛盾。本文旨在弥合这一差距，特别是在解决希尔伯特空间中的凸优化问题时。

Method: 使用有限维深度平衡层构建生成平衡算子(GEOs)，处理可分离希尔伯特空间上的凸优化问题族，其中输入是光滑凸损失函数，输出是相应优化问题的近似解。

Result: 证明当输入损失位于合适的无限维紧凑集中时，GEOs能以对数增长的秩、深度和宽度实现对解的均匀逼近，达到任意精度要求。

Conclusion: GEOs成功弥合了神经算子理论与实践的差距，在三个实际应用中验证了其有效性和可训练性，为无限维问题的高效求解提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的静态分析和搜索算法结合，有效解决了大型模型分布式分区的复杂性问题，实现了高效、自动化的最优分区方案发现。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

Motivation: 图神经网络在分子属性预测方面表现出色，但其黑盒性质降低了可解释性，限制了在药物发现等关键应用中的可信度。现有解释技术往往无法可靠量化原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: SEAL将输入图分解为化学相关片段，通过减少片段间消息传递来估计片段对模型输出的因果影响，实现片段贡献与预测的强对齐。

Conclusion: SEAL通过弥合预测性能和可解释性之间的差距，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

Motivation: 标准梯度下降方法只能提供点估计而无法给出置信度度量，这在过参数化和低数据场景下尤为严重。传统bootstrap方法在深度学习中不实用，需要训练多个副本且无法指导学习过程。

Method: 训练两个相同模型在独立bootstrap样本上并行训练，通过周期性均值重置保持两个轨迹在同一basin内，利用其发散度反映局部不确定性，并在训练过程中使用该估计进行自适应权重采样。

Result: 在深度神经网络和复杂高维逆问题中，该方法提高了校准性和泛化能力，并产生了可解释的不确定性图谱。

Conclusion: Twin-Boot成功将不确定性估计集成到优化过程中，为深度学习提供了有效的正则化机制和不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

Result: 研究发现最优估计器可能会丢弃超过特定污染阈值的样本，该阈值由给定的污染率经验分布决定。

Conclusion: 该工作为异质污染环境下的鲁棒估计提供了理论框架和最优性能界限，对分布式学习和传感器网络等应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

*Rustem Islamov,Niccolo Ajroldi,Antonio Orvieto,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出NGN-M优化算法，结合动量与NGN步长方法，在保持最优性能的同时显著提升对步长超参数的稳定性，无需严格假设条件即可达到标准收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代优化算法对超参数（特别是步长）选择高度敏感，调参困难且耗时。需要开发对超参数选择更稳定的优化器。

Method: 提出NGN-M算法，将NGN步长方法与动量机制相结合，在较宽松的假设条件下实现优化。

Result: 算法达到O(1/√K)的标准收敛率，无需插值条件或有界梯度假设，实验显示对步长超参数具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NGN-M算法在保持state-of-the-art性能的同时，显著提高了对步长超参数选择的稳定性，为深度学习优化提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

*Yen-Lung Lai,Zhe Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究分析了深度神经网络在过参数化状态下的泛化行为，发现输出特征空间会崩溃，虽然改善泛化但最终导致退化状态，通过新提出的"虫洞"解决方案可以绕过退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中"欺骗性样本"的现象，即神经网络对看似随机的输入产生高置信度分类，旨在理解DNN的泛化行为和学习动态。

Method: 引入基于最大似然估计的分析框架，避免传统的基于梯度的优化和显式标签方法，分析过参数化DNN的输出特征空间崩溃现象。

Result: 发现DNN在过参数化状态下会出现输出特征空间崩溃，虽然改善泛化但最终导致退化状态（不同输入映射到相同输出），提出的虫洞解决方案能够绕过这种退化。

Conclusion: 研究为DNN泛化提供了新见解，虫洞解决方案能够协调随机标签与有意义标签，为理解捷径学习提供了新视角，指明了无监督学习动态研究的未来方向。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估稀疏自编码器(SAEs)在减少神经元多义性方面的效果，提出基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念分离度评分，并开发了新的干预方法APP，在精确概念控制方面优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在神经元多义性问题，即单个神经元对多个不相关概念都有响应。虽然稀疏自编码器被提出用于缓解此问题，但缺乏与基础模型的定量比较。

Method: 使用Gemma-2-2B模型和多种SAE变体，在五个基准测试上评估。提出基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念分离度评分方法，并开发了两种干预策略：全神经元掩码和部分抑制，以及新的APP干预方法。

Result: SAEs确实减少了多义性并获得了更高的概念分离度，但更大的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的分离度，且常常损害下游性能。SAEs在使用部分抑制时能实现更精确的概念级控制，APP方法在目标概念移除方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏自编码器在提高神经元单义性方面有效，但需要在稀疏性和性能之间权衡。新提出的APP干预方法为精确的概念控制提供了有效工具，为模型可解释性研究提供了重要进展。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

TL;DR: Hydra是一个混合长上下文语言模型架构，结合了条件计算、长上下文记忆机制和稀疏专家混合，在约16亿参数规模下实现高效长序列处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统Transformer在处理长上下文时计算复杂度高的问题，需要设计一个结合状态空间模型效率、稀疏注意力选择性和专家混合容量的模块化架构。

Method: 集成Mamba风格的结构化状态空间模型(SSM)主干，结合间歇性稀疏全局注意力、分块级MoE前馈路由和双内存系统(工作内存+事实PKM内存)，采用分阶段课程学习策略。

Result: 通过小规模原型验证了实现可行性，展示了长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控专家路由等定性扩展行为，但完整规模的竞争性能仍需验证。

Conclusion: Hydra为模块化、输入自适应的长上下文语言模型提供了一个蓝图，结合了SSM效率、稀疏注意力、MoE容量和可学习内存，但端到端任务性能验证是未来工作。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对文本到图像生成模型涉及隐私、版权和安全问题的关注，需要研究概念消除技术的实际效果和强猛性。

Method: 提出了Side Effect Evaluation (副作用评估)标准化测试套件，包含层次化和组合提示，通过自动化评估流程量化概念消除技术的三个方面副作用。

Result: 实验结果显示CETs可以通过超类-子类层次结构和语义相似提示绕过，存在属性泄漏问题，以及注意力聚焦或分散的反直觉现象。

Conclusion: 概念消除技术目前存在显著的安全漏洞，需要更加健壮的测试和改进方法来确保其实际效果。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Method: 基于最近研究，提出了一种能够估计未知剩余训练数据Hessian矩阵的方法，这是高效遗忘的关键组件。利用这种估计技术，实现高效的零样本遗忘。

Result: 通过广泛的数据集实验验证了方法的有效性，能够在保持剩余数据性能的同时提供强大的理论保证。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了无源设置下的模型遗忘挑战，为实际应用场景中的隐私保护和版权合规提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Conclusion: 范畴论和余代数理论为强化学习提供了强大的数学基础，使得能够处理更广泛的异步分布式计算场景，并为通用强化学习算法设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Conclusion: 提出了解决DPML特有复现挑战的见解和最佳实践，以获得科学有效和可靠的结果，包括处理DP噪声带来的额外随机性

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

TL;DR: SafeLLM是一个基于反学习的防御框架，通过三阶段流程检测有害输出、定位有害知识并进行约束优化，有效降低越狱攻击成功率，同时保持模型通用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击通过制作对抗性提示绕过大语言模型的对齐机制，导致模型产生有害内容，严重威胁LLM的安全性。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 混合方法动态检测有害输出；2) 通过前馈网络激活进行词级有害内容追踪；3) 约束优化抑制不安全行为而不降低模型质量。

Result: 在多个越狱基准测试中，SafeLLM显著降低了攻击成功率（Vicuna、LLaMA、GPT-J模型），同时保持高通用性能，相比标准防御方法提供更强的安全保证和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 反学习是构建可扩展且有效的LLM安全性的有前景方向，SafeLLM实现了有针对性和不可逆的遗忘，同时保持语言流畅性和通用能力。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Conclusion: FairPrep填补了公平性基准测试领域的关键空白，为推进数据层面公平性研究提供了实用基础。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

TL;DR: 提出基于局部最优性保证的框架，用于合成黑盒机器学习模型的解释，平衡准确性和可解释性，通过多目标搜索和SAT验证实现可扩展的Pareto最优解释生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒机器学习模型解释需要在准确性和可解释性之间取得平衡，现有方法要么缺乏形式化保证，要么面临可扩展性问题。

Method: 使用多目标蒙特卡洛树搜索生成候选解释集，然后通过SAT求解器验证每个候选解的局部最优性。

Result: 在基准测试中，该方法生成的解释与具有全局保证的方法结果相近，但具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 基于局部最优性保证的框架能够有效合成Pareto最优解释，在保持结果质量的同时显著提升可扩展性。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出多窗口对比学习框架，通过从每个ECG实例提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，学习时间不变性特征，在PTB-XL数据集上实现更好的分类性能并显著减少预训练时间和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督对比学习方法通常只生成成对的增强视图，未能充分利用ECG记录的丰富时间结构信息，限制了模型性能。

Method: 多窗口对比学习框架，从每个ECG实例提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，通过统计量最大化它们的一致性，并借鉴慢特征分析原理学习时间不变性特征。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上，多窗口对比学习在多项指标上优于传统双视图方法：AUROC（0.891 vs 0.888）、F1分数（0.680 vs 0.679），同时预训练epoch减少4倍（32 vs 128），总预训练时间减少14.8%。

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为ECG分析提供了一种高效可扩展的自监督学习范式，也为生物医学时间序列数据的表示学习提供了有前景的通用框架。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Result: 在AIME 2025等挑战性基准测试中达到99.9%准确率，相比全并行思维减少84.7%的生成token

Conclusion: DeepConf是一种简单而强大的测试时推理优化方法，可无缝集成到现有服务框架中，显著提升效率和性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think
with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both
reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full
parallel thinking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文批判性评估了CSG复杂度指标在知识图谱链接预测中的有效性，发现其参数敏感且与性能指标相关性弱，提出了更可靠的结构和语义复杂度指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数据集复杂度对于评估知识图谱链接预测模型至关重要，但现有的CSG指标尚未在KG环境中得到验证，需要检验其声称的稳定性和泛化预测能力。

Method: 在多元关系链接预测背景下评估CSG指标，结合transformer嵌入的语义表示，引入并基准测试一组结构和语义KG复杂度指标，包括关系熵、最大关系多样性等。

Result: CSG对参数高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量扩展，与MRR和Hit@1的相关性弱或不一致。关系熵、最大关系多样性等指标与性能指标呈现强负相关，而图连通性指标与Hit@10正相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测设置中的稳定性和泛化预测能力未能得到验证，需要开发更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的数据集复杂度度量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Conclusion: ExBigBang通过整合多模态数据和可解释AI技术，为人物角色分类提供了更准确和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Motivation: 机器学习模型往往保留训练数据中的偏见，导致对少数群体的不公平待遇。现有企业端的偏见缓解技术通常需要付出效用成本和组织支持，而许多模型依赖用户贡献数据，因此用户可以通过算法集体行动来诱导公平性

Method: 提出三种实用的、模型无关的方法来近似理想的重新标记：1）协调的少数群体战略性地重新标记自己的数据；2）基于算法集体行动框架；3）不改变企业的训练过程

Conclusion: 用户驱动的数据重新标记是提升模型公平性的有效方法，通过算法集体行动框架，少数群体可以在不依赖企业干预的情况下实现公平性改善

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图嵌入方法面临两个关键问题：结构访问偏差（随机游走采样过度强调高节点度导致冗余噪声）和突变演化盲点（刚性时间建模策略无法有效检测突然结构变化），需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出EvoFormer框架，包含结构感知Transformer模块（基于节点结构角色的位置编码）和进化敏感时间模块（三步策略：随机游走时间戳分类、图级别时间分割、段感知时间自注意力与边进化预测）。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛评估证实，EvoFormer在图相似性排名、时间异常检测和时间分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EvoFormer通过纠正结构和时间偏差，有效解决了动态图嵌入中的关键挑战，验证了其在捕捉结构演化趋势方面的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized

Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI

decentralized data processing.

Result: 该方法能够高效处理DeepONet训练中的大规模线性优化问题，包括物理信息驱动的无监督学习场景

Conclusion: 提出的混合优化方法有效解决了DeepONet训练中的计算瓶颈，为大规模算子学习提供了可行的优化方案

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Method: 设计了一种专门检测重叠而非差异的相异度度量方法，计算速度比现有方法快数倍

Result: 该方法比对比方法快数倍，能够有效检测重叠聚类，同时避免正交聚类的错误合并

Conclusion: 提出的新度量方法为在线数据流学习中的聚类重叠检测提供了高效解决方案，特别适合处理多元高斯聚类

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够实现有效的持续遗忘，成功防御重新学习攻击，在遗忘效果和保持自然性能方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MRP方法通过不可逆投影变换从根本上解决了机器遗忘中的信息残留问题，为模型安全提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaVerLy是一种新的局部鲁棒性验证方法，通过动态构建和验证小批量ε球来加速神经网络对抗攻击的鲁棒性验证，平均提升2.3倍验证速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的局部鲁棒性验证器要么分析时间过长，要么精度损失太大，难以有效处理大量输入。需要一种能够利用ε球间网络计算相似性来减少总体分析时间的方法。

Method: 提出群组局部鲁棒性验证方法BaVerLy，通过自适应识别成功的小批量大小，构建具有相似网络计算的ε球小批量，并进行联合验证。如果小批量验证通过，则所有ε球都被证明是鲁棒的；否则指导细化过程。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10的全连接和卷积网络上评估显示，BaVerLy将传统一对一验证速度平均提升2.3倍，最高可达4.1倍，将总分析时间从24小时减少到6小时。

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过群组验证方法有效提升了局部鲁棒性验证的效率，为大规模输入集的鲁棒性分析提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

Motivation: 现有的基于欧几里得空间的检索方法无法有效捕捉分子相互作用的层次结构和细粒度亲和力变化，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性场景中。

Method: 提出HypSeek框架，利用双曲空间的指数几何和负曲率特性，采用蛋白质引导的三塔架构，在洛伦兹模型双曲空间中进行表示学习。

Result: 在DUD-E数据集上虚拟筛选的早期富集从42.63提升到51.44（+20.7%），在JACS数据集上亲和力排序相关性从0.5774提升到0.7239（+25.4%）。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为蛋白质-配体建模提供了强大的归纳偏置，能够统一处理虚拟筛选和亲和力排序任务，在挑战性场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Conclusion: FairGuide通过新链接引导和元梯度优化，成功提升了图神经网络的公平性，具有良好的泛化能力

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOF是一种用于多用户本地差分隐私的稳定扰动损失函数训练机制，通过扰动泰勒展开多项式近似来保护隐私，相比DP-SGD在计算效率和稳定性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度隐私保护方法如DP-SGD需要在梯度中注入噪声，导致计算效率低且稳定性差，需要一种更高效稳定的多用户隐私保护训练机制。

Method: SPOF通过扰动模型训练损失函数的稳定泰勒展开多项式近似来保护隐私，每个用户的数据通过向多项式系数添加校准噪声来实现私有化。

Result: 在无线体域网场景中，SPOF相比DP-SGD平均重建准确率提高3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%，在多用户环境中展现出更好的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: SPOF提供了一种计算效率更高、更稳定的多用户本地差分隐私训练方案，对训练过程中的环境噪声具有鲁棒性，在异构用户数据和随机信道噪声场景中表现优异。

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 解决RoPE方法在演绎性推理时需要批量测试样本的限制，影响扩展性和通用性。

Method: 使用小批量最优运输和条件正规化流，将检验和分布对齐集成到一个端到端可训练模型中，对共享同隐变参数的实际和模拟观测进行对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法在具有模型错设的具有挑战性环境中提供了更好的扩展性和适用性，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Motivation: 现有的动态主题模型需要一次性处理整个训练语料，而在线主题模型虽然能持续更新但缺乏长期记忆。需要一种能够持续学习新主题而不遗忘先前主题的方法。

Method: 使用全局先验分布持续更新的方式，构建Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM)，实现在后续时间步中持续学习主题模型而不遗忘先前所学内容。

Result: CoNTM在主题质量和预测困惑度方面持续优于动态主题模型，能够在线捕捉主题变化，学习更多样化的主题并更好地捕捉时间变化。

Conclusion: CoNTM填补了现有方法的空白，成功实现了持续学习主题模型而不遗忘的目标，在多个指标上表现出色。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Conclusion: GRASPED通过频域编码解码架构有效解决了图异常检测中标注数据稀缺和多尺度信息捕获的挑战，为无监督图异常检测提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: 分类错误问题及其贝叶斯解决方案适用于任何涉及事件检测和分类且错误率非零的分类器。研究强调了在自动分析中考虑分类错误对统计推断影响的重要性。

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种能够在整个训练过程中形式保证个体公平性的新框架，充分结合了公平性保证和训练效率。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

*Eric Ye,Ren Tao,Natasha Jaques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个开放式多代理环境，用于研究社会智能对AI代理在存在专家和隐式合作的环境中学习适应性技能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏开放式多代理环境来研究社会智能对AI代理训练的加速作用，而真实世界环境本身就是多代理且包含人类专家的。

Method: 设计了一个多个自利代理可以追求复杂独立目标的环境，反映真实世界挑战，支持隐式合作、工具共享和长期限目标实现。

Result: 调查了社会学习在专家存在情况下对代理性能的影响，以及突现的协作工具使用等隐式合作行为。

Conclusion: 该环境能够促进开放式多代理设置中社会智能AI代理的研究，并且代理可以通过合作或竞争在这种环境中获得好处。

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了PECANN框架的多项改进，包括多惩罚参数ALM、期望约束执行、傅里叶特征映射、时间窗口策略和条件自适应惩罚更新策略，显著提升了PDE求解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理约束神经网络框架在处理异质约束、多尺度特征和长时间演化问题时存在局限性，需要更高效、鲁棒的约束执行方法。

Method: 1) 推广ALM支持多惩罚参数；2) 将点约束重构为期望形式；3) 引入傅里叶特征映射；4) 时间窗口策略确保连续性；5) 提出条件自适应惩罚更新策略。

Result: 在跨音速稀疏问题、涡旋被动平流、高波数Helmholtz和Poisson方程、热源反演等问题上表现出色，与现有方法相比具有竞争优势。

Conclusion: PECANN-CAPU框架通过多项创新显著提升了约束执行的鲁棒性和效率，为科学计算中的复杂问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探索了D-Wave量子逆灰器与经典MCMC在RBM采样性能上的突出差异，尝试混合采样方法但在RBM训练中未获得改善，但发现量子采样在减缓灾除忘等机器学习应用中具有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释之前使用D-Wave采样在RBM训练中未能产生显著改善的原因，并探索如何利用量子与经典采样方法的差异来提升机器学习性能。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合采样方法，结合了经典MCMC和D-Wave量子逆灰器的采样贡献，并在RBM训练和灾除忘等缓解应用中进行了实验。

Result: 混合采样方法在RBM训练中未能实现改善，但量子采样在灾除忘等缓解中表现几乎相当于经典方法，且具有更快生成大量不同模式的潜力。

Conclusion: 量子逆灰器与经典采样在分布低概率区域的差异不足以改善RBM训练，但在生成式重现等机器学习应用中具有应用前景。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

*Amir Sarfi,Benjamin Thérien,Joel Lidin,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo是一种通信高效的分布式训练算法，通过Top-k稀疏化和2位量化实现高达1-3%的稀疏度和极端压缩比，在通信受限的LLM训练中优于全精度DiLoCo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练算法在带宽受限环境下仍存在通信瓶颈，即使减少通信频率也需要传输完整梯度副本，且性能略逊于标准AdamW DDP基线。量化方法在LLM预训练中难以同时利用稀疏化，压缩效果有限。

Method: 提出SparseLoCo算法，结合Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，利用外部动量的局部近似和误差反馈机制，实现极端压缩。关键发现是稀疏聚合可以提升模型性能。

Result: 在多种通信受限的LLM训练场景中，SparseLoCo在性能和通信成本方面均表现出显著优势，能够达到1-3%稀疏度和2位量化的极端压缩比。

Conclusion: SparseLoCo通过有效结合稀疏化和量化技术，成功解决了分布式LLM训练中的通信瓶颈问题，在保持甚至提升性能的同时大幅降低了通信开销。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从不确定、噪声数据中提取意义是时间序列分析、模式识别和语言建模中的基本问题。论文希望通过统一的数学框架来连接不同领域的方法，探讨它们如何共享核心的概率论原则。

Method: 通过分析最大似然估计、贝叶斯推断、注意机制等技术如何处理不确定性，以及通过系统识别、图像分类和语言生成等示例场景来展示复杂模型如何建立在这些基础上。

Result: 论文证明了最大似然估计、MAP估计、贝叶斯分类和深度学习都代表了同一个共享目标的不同方面：从噪声和/或偏差观测中推断隐藏原因。

Conclusion: 该研究既是理论综合，也是实践指南，为学生和研究人员在机器学习领域的发展提供了统一的概率论视角来理解和应对过拟合、数据稀疏性和可解释性等实际挑战。

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在生成模型中，数据似然作为最优OOD检测器的理论有效性，并通过在预训练ResNet-18表示空间上训练变分扩散模型来验证其实际性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI快速发展，安全性仍是部署机器学习系统的主要瓶颈。OOD检测是关键安全组件，而理论上数据似然是最优OOD检测器，但实践中常失败，需要探究是表示空间问题还是像素空间问题。

Method: 在预训练ResNet-18的表示空间上训练变分扩散模型，使用似然作为OOD分数，并与OpenOOD套件中的最先进方法进行比较评估。

Result: 通过实验验证了在表示空间中使用似然进行OOD检测的性能表现，与现有方法进行对比分析。

Conclusion: 研究旨在确定表示空间是否也存在密度估计问题，或者仅仅是生成模型中通常使用的像素空间的问题，为改进OOD检测提供新思路。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and

evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their

inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in
evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a
review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised
evaluation scenario, we present evidence for these claims and motivate several
research directions.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的局部嫉妒自由公平性概念，通过限制学生之间的熟人关系图结构，在保持帕累托效率的同时实现局部公平性匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统双边匹配中效率与公平性不可兼得，特别是在稳定婚姻问题中帕累托效率与无嫉妒公平性存在根本冲突。现有研究主要通过容忍嫉妒来放松公平性约束，本文采取不同方法，专注于解决学生更可能在意或优先考虑的嫉妒问题。

Method: 假设学生之间的嫉妒影响程度取决于他们是否相识，用无向图表示熟人关系，定义局部嫉妒（仅针对图中邻居的合理嫉妒）。提出局部嫉妒自由性作为新的放松公平性概念，并分析在特定图结构（接近树状）和学校单峰偏好下，帕累托效率匹配能否实现局部嫉妒自由性。

Result: 引入了Cho等人最近提出的放松公平性的局部版本，通过非负整数参数化局部嫉妒自由性的水平。明确了对于接近树状的图和图上单峰偏好，帕累托效率机制可以达到的局部嫉妒自由性水平。

Conclusion: 通过限制图结构和学校偏好，可以在保持帕累托效率的同时实现有意义的局部公平性，为解决效率与公平性的传统冲突提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Two-sided matching, such as matching between students and schools, has been
applied to various aspects of real life and has been the subject of much
research, however, it has been plagued by the fact that efficiency and fairness
are incompatible. In particular, Pareto efficiency and justified-envy-freeness
are known to be incompatible even in the simplest one-to-one matching, i.e.,
the stable marriage problem. In previous research, the primary approach to
improving efficiency in matchings has been to tolerate students' envy, thereby
relaxing fairness constraints. In this study, we take a different approach to
relaxing fairness. Specifically, it focuses on addressing only the envy that
students may experience or prioritize more highly and seeks matchings without
such envy. More specifically, this study assumes that envy towards students who
are not acquaintances has less impact compared to envy towards students who are
acquaintances. Accordingly, we assume that the students know each other or not,
represented by an undirected graph, and define a local envy as a justified envy
toward an acquaintance or a neighbor in the graph. We then propose the property
that there is no local envy as a new relaxed concept of fairness, called local
envy-freeness. We analyze whether Pareto-efficient matching can be achieved
while maintaining local envy-freeness by meaningfully restricting the graph
structure and the school's preferences. To analyze in detail the fairness that
can achieve Pareto-efficient matching, we introduce a local version of the
relaxed fairness recently proposed by Cho et al. (AAMAS 2024), which
parameterizes the level of local envy-freeness by nonnegative integers. We then
clarify the level of local envy-freeness that can be achieved by
Pareto-efficient mechanisms for graphs that are ``close'' to trees and
single-peaked preferences on the graphs.

Result: 提出了一个在FNP^NP时间内运行的算法，能够计算满足约束条件的ε-纳什均衡。证明了决策版本的NP-hard性，并给出了策略概率双指数小的下界。

Conclusion: 该工作为多人随机游戏中纳什均衡的近似计算提供了有效的算法框架，证明了ε-纳什均衡计算的可处理性，同时揭示了策略概率表示的下界限制。

Abstract: A strategy profile in a multi-player game is a Nash equilibrium if no player
can unilaterally deviate to achieve a strictly better payoff. A profile is an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium if no player can gain more than $\epsilon$ by
unilaterally deviating from their strategy. In this work, we use
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibria to approximate the computation of Nash equilibria.
Specifically, we focus on turn-based, multiplayer stochastic games played on
graphs, where players are restricted to stationary strategies -- strategies
that use randomness but not memory.
  The problem of deciding the constrained existence of stationary Nash
equilibria -- where each player's payoff must lie within a given interval -- is
known to be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete in such a setting (Hansen and
S{\o}lvsten, 2020). We extend this line of work to stationary $\epsilon$-Nash
equilibria and present an algorithm that solves the following promise problem:
given a game with a Nash equilibrium satisfying the constraints, compute an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium that $\epsilon$-satisfies those same constraints --
satisfies the constraints up to an $\epsilon$ additive error. Our algorithm
runs in FNP^NP time.
  To achieve this, we first show that if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists,
then one exists where the non-zero probabilities are at least an inverse of a
double-exponential in the input. We further prove that such a strategy can be
encoded using floating-point representations, as in the work of Frederiksen and
Miltersen (2013), which finally gives us our FNP^NP algorithm.
  We further show that the decision version of the promise problem is NP-hard.
Finally, we show a partial tightness result by proving a lower bound for such
techniques: if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists, then there must be one
that where the probabilities in the strategies are double-exponentially small.

Conclusion: 本文扩展了EFX分配的存在性结果，表明估值类型的多样性（而非代理数量）是影响EFX可达成性的关键因素，为多类型估值环境下的公平分配提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of a set of indivisible goods among
$n$ agents with $k$ distinct additive valuations, with the goal of achieving
approximate envy-freeness up to any good ($\alpha-\mathrm{EFX}$).
  It is known that EFX allocations exist for $n$ agents when there are at most
three distinct valuations due to HV et al. Furthermore, Amanatidis et al.
showed that a $\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation is guaranteed to exist when
number of agents is at most seven. In this paper, we show that a
$\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation exists for any number of agents when
there are at most four distinct valuations.
  Secondly, we consider a relaxation called $\mathrm{EFX}$ with charity, where
some goods remain unallocated such that no agent envies the set of unallocated
goods. Akrami et al. showed that for $n$ agents and any $\varepsilon \in
\left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right]$, there exists a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$
allocation with at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((n/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}})$
goods to charity. In this paper, we show that a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$
allocation with a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(k/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ charity
exists for any number of agents when there are at most $k$ distinct valuations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有混合现实重打光技术在实时性能、计算复杂度和准确性方面的挑战，特别是在边缘设备上的应用限制

Method: 结合图像分割技术、通过各向异性扩散进行光照传播，基于基础场景理解并维护了筛波技术的计算简单性

Conclusion: 该方法为混合现实场景重打光提供了一种高效、实时且准确的解决方案，在实际应用如房地产可视化中展示了具体价值

Abstract: Mixed Reality scene relighting, where virtual changes to lighting conditions
realistically interact with physical objects, producing authentic illumination
and shadows, can be used in a variety of applications. One such application in
real estate could be visualizing a room at different times of day and placing
virtual light fixtures. Existing deep learning-based relighting techniques
typically exceed the real-time performance capabilities of current MR devices.
On the other hand, scene understanding methods, such as on-device scene
reconstruction, often yield inaccurate results due to scanning limitations, in
turn affecting relighting quality. Finally, simpler 2D image filter-based
approaches cannot represent complex geometry and shadows. We introduce a novel
method to integrate image segmentation, with lighting propagation via
anisotropic diffusion on top of basic scene understanding, and the
computational simplicity of filter-based techniques. Our approach corrects
on-device scanning inaccuracies, delivering visually appealing and accurate
relighting effects in real-time on edge devices, achieving speeds as high as
100 fps. We show a direct comparison between our method and the industry
standard, and present a practical demonstration of our method in the
aforementioned real estate example.

TL;DR: DeCoDi是一种用于文本到图像扩散模型的去偏方法，通过改变推理过程避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，无需复杂干预或显著计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习去偏方法通常需要复杂或计算密集的干预，而DeCoDi旨在仅改变推理过程，使其对更广泛的实践者更加可访问

Method: 改变扩散过程以避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，该方法仅修改推理过程而不需要重新训练模型

Result: 在护士、消防员和CEO等概念上成功去除了性别、种族和年龄偏见，人工评估1200张图像显示方法有效，GPT4o自动评估与人工评估结果统计无显著差异

Conclusion: DeCoDi方法能显著提高扩散式文本到图像生成模型生成图像的多样性，具有可靠的一致性和更好的受保护属性覆盖

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

Motivation: 军事车辆移动环境中的噪声会降低枪声检测系统的性能，需要开发计算资源需求低的降噪算法

Method: 采用两层隐藏层的轻量级感知器神经网络结合信号处理技术，替代重型卷积神经网络

Result: 在噪声RMS值与枪口冲击波峰值幅度相当时，检测率提高了一倍以上

Conclusion: 轻量级神经网络架构能有效提升移动军事环境中枪声检测系统的性能，且适合嵌入式硬件平台

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array
and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield. The
performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment
in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military
vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the
software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network
has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a
lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational
resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as
possible. Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and
appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive
muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the
position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise
of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more
than doubled with this denoising processing.

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion

associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The
study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose
a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion
recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further
model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel
approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution.
The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a
dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding
window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human
feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified
annotation procedure.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more
interpretable results.

Conclusion: 新的音频特征提取方法和无参数特征增强策略能够有效提高机器异常声音检测的性能，并促进预训练知识向ASD任务的有效转移。

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from
machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and
industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant
information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD
system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks
with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency
ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine
sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a
parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in
machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the
effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD
task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset
demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed
methods.

Abstract: AudioSet is a widely used benchmark in the audio research community and has
significantly advanced various audio-related tasks. However, persistent issues
with label accuracy and completeness remain critical bottlenecks that limit
performance in downstream applications.To address the aforementioned
challenges, we propose a three-stage reannotation framework that harnesses
general-purpose audio-language foundation models to systematically improve the
label quality of AudioSet. The framework employs a cross-modal prompting
strategy, inspired by the concept of prompt chaining, wherein prompts are
sequentially composed to execute subtasks (audio comprehension, label
synthesis, and semantic alignment). Leveraging this framework, we construct a
high-quality, structured relabeled version of AudioSet-R. Extensive experiments
conducted on representative audio classification models--including AST, PANNs,
SSAST, and AudioMAE--consistently demonstrate substantial performance
improvements, thereby validating the generalizability and effectiveness of the
proposed approach in enhancing label reliability.The code is publicly available

TL;DR: DualMark是首个双溯源水印框架，能够在音频生成模型中同时嵌入模型身份和数据集来源两种水印，解决了现有方法只能进行模型级溯源而无法追踪训练数据集的根本局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频生成模型水印方法只能识别生成模型，无法追踪底层训练数据集，这在版权和问责场景中存在重大限制。需要同时实现模型和数据集的溯源能力。

Method: 提出Dual Watermark Embedding (DWE)模块在梅尔频谱图中嵌入双重水印，配合Watermark Consistency Loss (WCL)确保从生成音频中可靠提取两种水印，并建立了Dual Attribution Benchmark (DAB)评估基准。

Result: DualMark实现了出色的溯源准确率（模型溯源97.01% F1分数，数据集溯源91.51% AUC），在激进剪枝、有损压缩、加性噪声和采样攻击等条件下保持优异鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作为实现完全可问责的音频生成模型提供了基础性步骤，显著增强了版权保护和责任追踪能力。

Abstract: Existing watermarking methods for audio generative models only enable
model-level attribution, allowing the identification of the originating
generation model, but are unable to trace the underlying training dataset. This
significant limitation raises critical provenance questions, particularly in
scenarios involving copyright and accountability concerns. To bridge this
fundamental gap, we introduce DualMark, the first dual-provenance watermarking
framework capable of simultaneously encoding two distinct attribution
signatures, i.e., model identity and dataset origin, into audio generative
models during training. Specifically, we propose a novel Dual Watermark
Embedding (DWE) module to seamlessly embed dual watermarks into Mel-spectrogram
representations, accompanied by a carefully designed Watermark Consistency Loss
(WCL), which ensures reliable extraction of both watermarks from generated
audio signals. Moreover, we establish the Dual Attribution Benchmark (DAB), the
first robustness evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for joint
model-data attribution. Extensive experiments validate that DualMark achieves
outstanding attribution accuracy (97.01% F1-score for model attribution, and
91.51% AUC for dataset attribution), while maintaining exceptional robustness
against aggressive pruning, lossy compression, additive noise, and sampling
attacks, conditions that severely compromise prior methods. Our work thus
provides a foundational step toward fully accountable audio generative models,
significantly enhancing copyright protection and responsibility tracing
capabilities.

Abstract: Speaker attribute perturbation offers a feasible approach to asynchronous
voice anonymization by employing adversarially perturbed speech as anonymized
output. In order to enhance the identity unlinkability among anonymized
utterances from the same original speaker, the targeted attack training
strategy is usually applied to anonymize the utterances to a common designated
speaker. However, this strategy may violate the privacy of the designated
speaker who is an actual speaker. To mitigate this risk, this paper proposes an
any-to-any training strategy. It is accomplished by defining a batch mean loss
to anonymize the utterances from various speakers within a training mini-batch
to a common pseudo-speaker, which is approximated as the average speaker in the
mini-batch. Based on this, a speaker-adversarial speech generation model is
proposed, incorporating the supervision from both the untargeted attack and the
any-to-any strategies. The speaker attribute perturbations are generated and
incorporated into the original speech to produce its anonymized version. The
effectiveness of the proposed model was justified in asynchronous voice
anonymization through experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb datasets.
Additional experiments were carried out to explore the potential limitations of
speaker-adversarial speech in voice privacy protection. With them, we aim to
provide insights for future research on its protective efficacy against
black-box speaker extractors \textcolor{black}{and adaptive attacks, as well
as} generalization to out-of-domain datasets \textcolor{black}{and stability}.

Abstract: Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) is a fundamental problem in computational
audition, which seeks to classify environments based on the distinctive
acoustic features. In the ASC task of the APSIPA ASC 2025 Grand Challenge, the
organizers introduce a multimodal ASC task. Unlike traditional ASC systems that
rely solely on audio inputs, this challenge provides additional textual
information as inputs, including the location where the audio is recorded and
the time of recording. In this paper, we present our proposed system for the
ASC task in the APSIPA ASC 2025 Grand Challenge. Specifically, we propose a
multimodal network, \textbf{ASCMamba}, which integrates audio and textual
information for fine-grained acoustic scene understanding and effective
multimodal ASC. The proposed ASCMamba employs a DenseEncoder to extract
hierarchical spectral features from spectrograms, followed by a dual-path Mamba
blocks that capture long-range temporal and frequency dependencies using
Mamba-based state space models. In addition, we present a two-step
pseudo-labeling mechanism to generate more reliable pseudo-labels. Results show
that the proposed system outperforms all the participating teams and achieves a

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

Abstract: Wildlife field operations demand efficient parallel deployment methods to
identify and interact with specific individuals, enabling simultaneous
collective behavioral analysis, and health and safety interventions. Previous
robotics solutions approach the problem from the herd perspective, or are
manually operated and limited in scale. We propose a decentralized vision-based
multi-quadrotor system for wildlife monitoring that is scalable, low-bandwidth,
and sensor-minimal (single onboard RGB camera). Our approach enables robust
identification and tracking of large species in their natural habitat. We
develop novel vision-based coordination and tracking algorithms designed for
dynamic, unstructured environments without reliance on centralized
communication or control. We validate our system through real-world
experiments, demonstrating reliable deployment in diverse field conditions.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了使用预训练大语言模型进行上下文学习来实现动态操作任务，通过预测基于先前交互的参数策略调整，在低数据环境下优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在语言任务中表现出色推理能力和少样本学习能力，但动态操作任务面临高维度、复杂动态和部分可观测性等挑战，需要探索如何将这种能力扩展到物理操作领域。

Method: 采用迭代方法，将上下文学习问题表述为基于先前交互预测参数策略的调整，在仿真和物理机器人上测试多个任务。

Result: 研究表明，在低数据环境下，利用上下文学习的方法优于其他替代方法，在仿真和物理机器人实验中均取得良好效果。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型的上下文学习能力可以成功应用于动态操作任务，为解决复杂物理操作问题提供了一种有效的少样本学习方法。

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

TL;DR: NeRD是一种神经网络驱动的机器人动力学模拟器，能够替代传统分析模拟器中的底层动力学和接触求解器，实现稳定准确的长期模拟，并具有良好的泛化能力和从真实数据微调的能力。

Result: 实验表明NeRD模拟器在数千个模拟步骤中保持稳定准确；能够跨任务和环境配置泛化；支持在神经引擎中进行策略学习；并且可以从真实世界数据微调以缩小模拟与现实的差距。

Conclusion: NeRD为关节刚体机器人提供了通用化的神经模拟解决方案，克服了现有神经模拟器的局限性，在准确性、稳定性和泛化能力方面表现出色，并能通过真实数据微调来弥合模拟与现实之间的差距。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

Motivation: 传统基于相机或LiDAR的地图匹配方法在烟雾、灰尘等恶劣环境中表现不佳，而磁力计能够检测其他传感器无法感知的磁场特征，并在这些环境中保持鲁棒性

Method: 提出基于磁场高阶导数的特征描述子，利用物理信息高斯过程进行概率推理，提取磁场及其导数特征，实现旋转不变的地图匹配

Conclusion: Mag-Match提供了一种在恶劣环境下鲁棒的地图匹配解决方案，通过磁场特征实现了无需重力对齐的精确注册和定位

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments
against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map,
and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational
alignment.

Conclusion: Lang2Lift框架展示了在操作物流和建筑环境中部署的可行性，为解决户外自动化托盘搬运提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification
model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained
strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience.
Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within
an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the
general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the
stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones. Code is

Conclusion: Kitchen-R填补了具身AI研究中的关键空白，实现了对语言引导机器人代理更全面和现实的基准测试。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

Motivation: 以往研究多数关注如何最小化基座与操纵手臂之间的动态耦合，而忽视了耦合可能带来的优势。本文想要探索如何利用动态耦合来改善轨迹规划效果。

Method: 采用动态耦合矩阵的奇异值分解(SVD)来识别主导的耦合组件，形成定量指标来度量耦合强度和方向性，并将其整合到轨迹优化框架中。设计滑模控制跟踪控制器来验证优化轨迹的可行性。

Result: 模拟结果表明，在轨迹规划中明确考虑动态耦合可以实现更智能和更高效的系统操作。

Conclusion: 本研究为自由浮动空间操纵手系统的控制提供了新的方向，证明了利用动态耦合特性而非避免它可以提高系统性能。

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型灵巧操作策略经常出现空闲现象（停止移动），这反映了训练数据的局限性，特别是在需要高精度动作的区域。传统方法如数据过滤或控制频率调整可能会负面影响策略性能。

Method: 提出PIP方法：检测策略空闲状态，在这些状态下施加扰动，帮助策略逃离问题区域。该方法无需额外监督或训练，通过扰动促进探索和策略改进。

Result: 在模拟双臂任务中显著改善测试性能，在真实世界插入任务中实现15-35%的绝对成功率提升，特别是在需要复杂多指操作的任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PIP是一种简单有效的策略改进方法，能够通过检测和扰动空闲状态来提升灵巧操作的鲁棒性和成功率，且不需要额外监督或训练成本。

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

Abstract: Coordinating workflows across heterogeneous control systems remains a central
challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities,
industrial plants, and energy infrastructures. Language-model-driven agents
offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack
scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Alpha Berkeley
Framework, a production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that
integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration. The framework
features dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools per
task, a plan-first orchestration model that generates execution plans with
explicit dependencies and optional human approval, context-aware task
extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain
resources, and production-ready execution environments with checkpointing,
artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility
through two case studies: a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example and a
deployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator. These results
establish Alpha Berkeley as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic
systems in high-stakes domains.

Conclusion: HEAS为跨学科多层次研究提供了实用基础，能够产生可靠、可重现的结果，通过两个紧凑示例（生态系统和企业决策）展示了其应用价值。

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.

Abstract: Agent-based simulation platforms play a key role in enabling fast-to-run
evolution experiments that can be precisely controlled and observed in detail.
Availability of high-resolution snapshots of lineage ancestries from digital
experiments, in particular, is key to investigations of evolvability and
open-ended evolution, as well as in providing a validation testbed for
bioinformatics method development. Ongoing advances in AI/ML hardware
accelerator devices, such as the 850,000-processor Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine
(WSE), are poised to broaden the scope of evolutionary questions that can be
investigated in silico. However, constraints in memory capacity and locality
characteristic of these systems introduce difficulties in exhaustively tracking
phylogenies at runtime. To overcome these challenges, recent work on hereditary
stratigraphy algorithms has developed space-efficient genetic markers to
facilitate fully decentralized estimation of relatedness among digital
organisms. However, in existing work, compute time to reconstruct phylogenies
from these genetic markers has proven a limiting factor in achieving
large-scale phyloanalyses. Here, we detail an improved trie-building algorithm
designed to produce reconstructions equivalent to existing approaches. For
modestly-sized 10,000-tip trees, the proposed approach achieves a 300-fold
speedup versus existing state-of-the-art. Finally, using 1 billion genome
datasets drawn from WSE simulations encompassing 954 trillion replication
events, we report a pair of large-scale phylogeny reconstruction trials,
achieving end-to-end reconstruction times of 2.6 and 2.9 hours. In
substantially improving reconstruction scaling and throughput, presented work
establishes a key foundation to enable powerful high-throughput phyloanalysis
techniques in large-scale digital evolution experiments.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了人类大脑进行符号思维的关键机制，提出动态绑定加上多位置谓词和结构映射是符号思维的最小必要条件，并通过17个模拟实验验证了这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解人类大脑为何能够进行符号推理而大多数动物不能，探索符号思维的关键神经机制，特别是动态绑定是否足够以及还需要哪些额外能力。

Method: 通过17个通用模拟实验，比较具有和不具有多位置谓词和结构映射能力的认知架构在各种任务中的表现，确保任务不能通过诊断特征完成，而是依赖所研究的认知能力。

Result: 实验结果支持假设：除了动态绑定外，多位置谓词和结构映射是基本符号思维的最小必要条件。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于理解人类大脑如何产生符号思维，揭示了生物智能与机器学习方法的差异，并对生物启发的人工智能具有重要启示意义。

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.

Conclusion: LyLA-Therm架构通过热力学启发的随机控制方法，有效平衡了探索与利用，在控制性能方面显著优于确定性基线方法

Abstract: Thermodynamic principles can be employed to design parameter update laws that
address challenges such as the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma. In this
paper, inspired by the Langevin equation, an update law is developed for a
Lyapunov-based DNN control method, taking the form of a stochastic differential
equation. The drift term is designed to minimize the system's generalized
internal energy, while the diffusion term is governed by a user-selected
generalized temperature law, allowing for more controlled fluctuations. The
minimization of generalized internal energy in this design fulfills the
exploitation objective, while the temperature-based stochastic noise ensures
sufficient exploration. Using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed
Lyapunov-based Langevin Adaptive Thermodynamic (LyLA-Therm) neural network
controller achieves probabilistic convergence of the tracking and parameter
estimation errors to an ultimate bound. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, with the LyLA-Therm architecture
achieving up to 20.66% improvement in tracking errors, up to 20.89% improvement
in function approximation errors, and up to 11.31% improvement in
off-trajectory function approximation errors compared to the baseline
deterministic approach.

Conclusion: 改进的Opti-KRON框架显著提高了网络缩减的效率和准确性，在大规模系统中实现了高比例缩减和低电压误差，同时保持了网络的径向特性，为电力系统优化控制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Network reduction simplifies complex electrical networks to address
computational challenges of large-scale transmission and distribution grids.
Traditional network reduction methods are often based on a predefined set of
nodes or lines to remain in the reduced network. This paper builds upon
previous work on Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Networks (Opti-KRON), which
was formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), to enhance the
framework in two aspects. First, the scalability is improved via a cutting
plane restriction, tightened Big~M bounds, and a zero-injection node reduction
stage. Next, we introduce a radiality-preservation step to identify and recover
nodes whose restoration ensures radiality of the reduced network. The model is
validated through its application to the 533-bus distribution test system and a
3499-bus realistic test feeder for a set of representative loading scenarios.
In the 533-bus system, an 85% reduction was achieved with a maximum voltage
error below 0.0025 p.u., while in the 3499-bus feeder, over 94% reduction was
obtained with maximum voltage errors below 0.002 p.u. Additionally, we show
that the radialization step accelerates the runtime of optimal voltage control
problems when applied to Kron-reduced networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 魔鬼棒螺旋桨运动的控制问题是一个未被文献研究过的欠驱动机器人杂耍示例，需要解决在垂直平面内通过脉冲力实现稳定旋转的挑战。

Method: 引入离散虚拟完整约束(DVHC)概念，在脉冲输入时刻指定质心位置与方向角的关系，建立离散零动力学(DZD)，并设计了基于脉冲控制庞加莱映射的轨道稳定控制器。

Result: 通过仿真验证了该方法在轨迹设计和稳定化方面的有效性，在连续脉冲间隔趋近无穷小的极限情况下，问题可退化为连续强迫下的螺旋桨运动。

Conclusion: DVHC方法为欠驱动脉冲控制系统提供了一种有效的轨道稳定控制框架，成功解决了魔鬼棒螺旋桨运动的控制问题。

Abstract: The control problem of realizing propeller motion of a devil-stick in the
vertical plane using impulsive forces applied normal to the stick is
considered. This problem is an example of underactuated robotic juggling and
has not been considered in the literature before. Inspired by virtual holonomic
constraints, the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) is
introduced for the first time to solve this orbital stabilization problem. At
the discrete instants when impulsive inputs are applied, the location of the
center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation
angle. This yields the discrete zero dynamics (DZD), which provides conditions
for stable propeller motion. In the limiting case, when the rotation angle
between successive applications of impulsive inputs is chosen to be arbitrarily
small, the problem reduces to that of propeller motion under continuous
forcing. A controller that enforces the DVHC, and an orbit stabilizing
controller based on the impulse controlled Poincar\'e map approach are
presented. The efficacy of the approach to trajectory design and stabilization
is validated through simulations.

Result: 结果显示分时电价和负载均衡策略都能有效管理额外电动车负载，减少现有基础设施的升级需求和成本。在高注册水平下，负载均衡策略表现更优于分时电价策略。

Conclusion: 智能充电策略在促进电动车集成的同时能够保持配电网络的可靠性并降低投资成本，具有实际应用的可行性。

Abstract: The anticipated widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a
critical evaluation of existing power distribution infrastructures, as EV
integration imposes additional stress on distribution networks that can lead to
component overloading and power quality degradation. Implementing smart
charging mechanisms can mitigate these adverse effects and defer or even avoid
upgrades. This study assesses the performance of two smart charging strategies
- Time of Use (TOU) pricing and Load Balancing (LB) on seven representative
real-world feeders identified using k-means clustering. A time series-based
steady-state load flow analysis was conducted on these feeders to simulate the
impact of EV charging under both strategies across four different EV enrollment
scenarios and three representative days to capture seasonal load
characteristics. A grid upgrade strategy has been proposed to strengthen the
power grid to support EV integration with minimal cost. Results demonstrate
that both TOU and LB strategies effectively manage the additional EV load with
reduced upgrade requirement and cost to existing infrastructure compared to the
case without smart charging strategies and LB outperforms TOU when the customer
enrollment levels are high. These findings support the viability of smart
charging in facilitating EV integration while maintaining distribution network
reliability and reducing investment cost.

*Xinhao Yan,Bo Chen,Hailong Huang*

Main category: eess.SY

Conclusion: 局部差分隐私更适合多传感器融合估计的隐私保护需求，通过系统固有随机性和高斯噪声机制可以有效实现隐私保护，同时保持估计性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving multi-sensor fusion estimation
(MSFE) problem with differential privacy considerations. Most existing research
efforts are directed towards the exploration of traditional differential
privacy, also referred to as centralized differential privacy (CDP). It is
important to note that CDP is tailored to protect the privacy of statistical
data at fusion center such as averages and sums rather than individual data at
sensors, which renders it inappropriate for MSFE. Additionally, the definitions
and assumptions of CDP are primarily applicable for large-scale systems that
require statistical results mentioned above. Therefore, to address these
limitations, this paper introduces a more recent advancement known as
\emph{local differential privacy (LDP)} to enhance the privacy of MSFE. We
provide some rigorous definitions about LDP based on the intrinsic properties
of MSFE rather than directly presenting the assumptions under CDP.
Subsequently, the LDP is proved to be realized with system intrinsic
randomness, which is useful and has never been considered before. Furthermore,
the Gaussian mechanism is designed when the intrinsic randomness is
insufficient. The lower bound of the covariance for extra injected Gaussian
noises is determined by integrating system information with privacy budgets.
Moreover, the optimal fusion estimators under intrinsic and extra disturbances
are respectively designed in the linear minimum variance sense. Finally, the
effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified through numerical
simulations, encompassing both one-dimensional and high-dimensional scenarios.

Abstract: Range and performance are key customer-relevant properties of electric
vehicles. Both degrade over time due to battery aging, thus impacting business
decisions throughout a vehicle's lifecycle, such as efficient utilization and
asset valuation. For practical assessment, aging is often simplified into a
single figure of merit - the state of health - typically defined by the battery
pack's remaining capacity or energy. However, no standardized method for
measuring the state of health at the vehicle level has been established,
leaving both academia and industry without a clear consensus. Ultimately,
standardization is crucial to increase transparency and build confidence in the
long-term reliability of electric vehicles' battery packs. In this article, we
propose a standard measurement procedure for assessing the capacity- and
energy-based state of health, leveraging onboard charging to enable
reproducibility and scalability. Additionally, we demonstrate how differential
voltage analysis can provide deeper insights into battery aging at the vehicle
level.

Motivation: 针对具有未知动态的随机动力系统，需要自动化地合成正确构造的控制策略，传统方法需要完整的系统模型信息，而实际应用中系统动态往往是未知的。

Method: 从采样数据中学习抽象，构建有限状态区间MDP（IMDP）抽象，仅需要噪声状态-输入-状态观测和系统Lipschitz常数上界。

Conclusion: 该方法为未知动态随机系统提供了一种实用的控制策略合成框架，仅需有限信息即可构建可靠的系统抽象。

Abstract: We study the automated abstraction-based synthesis of correct-by-construction
control policies for stochastic dynamical systems with unknown dynamics. Our
approach is to learn an abstraction from sampled data, which is represented in
the form of a finite Markov decision process (MDP). In this paper, we present a
data-driven technique for constructing finite-state interval MDP (IMDP)
abstractions of stochastic systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics. As a
distinguishing and novel feature, our technique only requires (1) noisy
state-input-state observations and (2) an upper bound on the system's Lipschitz
constant. Combined with standard model-checking techniques, our IMDP
abstractions enable the synthesis of policies that satisfy probabilistic
temporal properties (such as "reach-while-avoid") with a predefined confidence.
Our experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决神经网络控制器在实时嵌入式系统中的稳定性验证问题，特别是当鲁棒MPC由于计算复杂而无法实时运行时，需要一种可验证的替代方案。

Method: 首先开发状态估计器和控制导向模型，然后合成基线LQR和鲁棒MPC，接着使用通用化程序生成模仿MPC的NNC，最后通过SOS方法验证闭环系统的局部渐近稳定性和吸引域估计。

Result: 实验结果表明，NNC不仅能够稳定系统，而且在调节和参考跟踪任务中相比基线LQR都有更好的控制性能。

Conclusion: SOS-based稳定性验证方法为神经网络控制器的实际应用提供了可行的验证框架，证明了NNC在模仿复杂控制器方面的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: This work newly establishes the feasibility and practical value of a sum of
squares (SOS)-based stability verification procedure for applied control
problems utilizing neural-network-based controllers (NNCs). It successfully
verifies closed-loop stability properties of a NNC synthesized using a
generalizable procedure to imitate a robust, tube-based model predictive
controller (MPC) for a two-wheeled inverted pendulum demonstrator system. This
is achieved by first developing a state estimator and control-oriented model
for the two-wheeled inverted pendulum. Next, this control-oriented model is
used to synthesize a baseline linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and a robust,
tube-based MPC, which is computationally too demanding for real-time execution
on the demonstrator system's embedded hardware. The generalizable synthesis
procedure generates an NNC imitating the robust, tube-based MPC. Via an
SOS-based stability verification procedure, a certificate of local asymptotic
stability and a relevant inner estimate of the region of attraction (RoA) are
obtained for the closed-loop system incorporating this NNC. Finally,
experimental results on the physical two-wheeled inverted pendulum demonstrate
that the NNC both stabilizes the system, and improves the control performance
compared to the baseline LQR in both regulation and reference-tracking tasks.

Abstract: We describe a framework of modeling a central chilled
  water plant (CCWP) that consists of an aggregate
  cooling coil, a number of heterogeneous chillers and
  cooling towers, and a chilled water-based thermal
  energy storage system. We improve upon existing component
  models from the open literature using a constrained
  optimization-based framework to ensure that the models
  respect capacities of all the heat exchangers (cooling
  coils, chillers, and cooling towers) irrespective of
  the inputs provided. As a result, the proposed model has a wider
  range of validity compared to existing models; the
  latter can produce highly erroneous outputs when inputs are not
  within normal operating range. This
  feature is essential for training learning-based
  controllers that can choose inputs beyond normal operating conditions and is
lacking in currently available
  models. The overall plant model is
  implemented in Matlab and is made publicly
  available. Simulation of a CCWP with closed loop
  control is provided as an illustration.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully-integrated CMOS voltage reference designed in a
90 nm process node using low voltage threshold (LVT) transistor models. The
voltage reference leverages subthreshold operation and near-weak inversion

with a line sensitivity of 1.65 %/V and a power supply rejection ratio (PSRR)
of -50 dB at 10 kHz. The circuit achieves all these parameters while
maintaining a good power efficiency, consuming only 0.67 $\mu$W.
