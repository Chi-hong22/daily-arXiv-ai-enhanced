While recent Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual\nunderstanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and\nunderstanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model\narchitecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in\nexisting datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and\nintroduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with\nOCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6\nstate-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded\narchitectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus\nreasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric\nreliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA\nScore as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these\nfindings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe\nthat fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual\nperformance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that\neffectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization\nability.", "AI": {"tldr": "本文系统评估了视觉语言翻译（VLT）任务，从数据质量、模型架构和评估指标三个角度展开研究，提出了新数据集AibTrans、对比了多种模型的性能，并提出了更鲁棒的评估方法DA Score。", "motivation": "现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在VLT任务上缺乏系统性评估和理解，需要研究其性能瓶颈和改进方法。", "method": "1. 提出AibTrans数据集；2. 对比11种商业和6种开源模型；3. 提出Density-Aware Evaluation和DA Score。", "result": "发现高资源语言对微调会损害跨语言性能，并提出平衡多语言微调策略。", "conclusion": "建立了新的VLT评估基准，并提出了改进模型性能的有效策略。"}}
