TL;DR: 通过CHAIR指标和DPO对齐技术，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLM模型生成与视觉输入不符的幻觉内容的长期问题

Method: 利用CHAIR指标区分非幻觉和幻觉样本，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)对MLLM进行微调

Result: 在多个幻觉测试集上显著减少了幻觉回答的数量

Conclusion: CHAIR-DPO方法通过简单有效的对齐训练，能够提升MLLM的生成质量

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [2] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间，实现了更高效准确的图像伪造定位方法，在多个数据集上较现有方法提升12%性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以跟上新兴多模态大模型引领的图像编辑技术发展，需要更高效准确的解决方案。

Method: 利用SD3的多模态处理能力，将图像伪造残差（通过高通滤波器提取的高频信号）作为显式模态融入潜空间进行训练，同时保留SD3提取的丰富语义信息。

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上较现有最佳方法提升了12%性能，并在未见过的真实文档伪造图像和自然场景伪造图像上也表现出强劲性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了依赖人工标注数据的限制，利用多模态大模型的生成和感知能力实现了更高效准确的图像伪造定位，具有良好的演绎性和应用前景。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

### [3] [VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By Value Sign Flip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10931)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种简单高效的负向提示引导方法，通过翻转注意力值符号来抑制不需要的内容，在少步扩散和流匹配模型中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CFG、NASA和NAG在负向提示引导方面存在不足，特别是在少步生成模型中需要更有效的抑制不需要内容的方法

Method: 动态翻转负向提示的注意力值符号，计算开销小，兼容MMDiT架构和基于交叉注意力的模型

Result: 在复杂提示对数据集上验证，VSF在少步模型中显著优于现有方法，甚至在非少步模型中优于CFG，同时保持图像质量

Conclusion: VSF提供了一种计算高效的负向提示引导解决方案，在静态图像和视频生成任务中都表现出色

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in
https://github.com/weathon/VSF/tree/main.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合的方法，通过微调使模型能够从图像预测皮肤病变属性值，从而提高AI皮肤疾病诊断的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但模型预测的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能在实际临床中使用。研究旨在结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性分析来提高诊断解释性。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型，通过微调使其能够从皮肤病变图像预测定量属性值（如病变面积等），并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行基于属性的图像检索案例研究。

Result: 研究表明多模态大语言模型的嵌入空间可以基于定量属性进行grounding，模型能够成功预测与病变外观相关的定量属性值。

Conclusion: 结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性分析的方法为提高AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，使诊断推理能够以自然语言交互形式呈现。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [5] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，结合监督、自监督和重建目标，在少量标注数据下实现高效自动调制识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，在微调中使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR水平下保持强性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [6] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器和手部特定奖励机制，生成高分辨率、长时长的视频，解决了身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动人体动画方法存在错误累积导致身份漂移、颜色偏移和场景不稳定，同时手部运动建模不佳导致失真和音频不同步的问题。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率长视频；利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移；引入基于高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能，在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面表现优异。消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，有效解决了音频驱动人体动画中的身份漂移和手部失真问题，能够生成高质量的长时长视频。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [7] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了两个新颖的360度视频显著性预测模型SalViT360和SalViT360-AV，并创建了包含81个ODV视频的YT360-EyeTracking数据集，通过整合空间音频线索显著提升了全景视频中的视觉显著性预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对360度环境中球形畸变和空间音频整合的复杂性，以及缺乏全面的360度视听显著性预测数据集的问题，本研究旨在探索如何利用视听线索有效预测360度视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 提出了两个模型：SalViT360（基于视觉变换器的框架，配备球形几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV（进一步整合了基于音频输入的变换器适配器），并创建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集包含81个在不同视听条件下观察的全向视频。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中观看者注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于全向视频中准确的显著性预测至关重要，音频信息的加入显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [8] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个结合视觉语言模型的管道，用于在样本和数据集层面解释视觉模型的行为，旨在解决现有xAI方法在解释视觉模型整体行为方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标如准确率、IoU和mAP，但由于xAI方法应用于训练模型的复杂性，对可解释性的关注较少。现有xAI方法多为逐样本解释，缺乏对视觉模型在大型数据集上运行后表现出的整体行为的解释方法。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型，提出一个管道来在样本和数据集层面解释视觉模型。该管道可以发现失败案例并以最小努力获得对视觉模型的洞察。

Result: 提出的管道能够整合视觉模型开发与xAI分析，推进图像分析的发展。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于防止有偏见的判断，识别模型的趋势和模式，为视觉模型提供更全面的可解释性分析。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Motivation: 针对农业资源受限环境开发轻量级CNN模型，解决传统知识蒸馏方法在农业计算机视觉应用中的性能限制问题。

Method: 结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强的知识蒸馏框架，使用MobileNetV3 Large作为教师模型，训练三种不同规模的残差CNN学生模型（1.3M、2.4M、3.8M参数）。

Result: 所有学生模型验证准确率超过96.7%，紧凑模型达到97.11%准确率，比第二名方法提升1.60个百分点，推理延迟仅72.19ms，知识保留率超过99%。

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在保持低延迟的同时显著提升了轻量级模型的性能，特别适合农业环境中的资源受限应用，证明了自适应温度调度和混合样本增强的有效性。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的视觉语言表征框架，将微观结构信息学与专家表征知识相结合，通过定制化的相似性表征实现零样本分类，有效区分增材制造金属基复合材料的合格与缺陷样品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中先进材料的快速可靠鉴定存在瓶颈，特别是对于非传统增材制造工艺生产的异质结构。需要开发能够连接微观结构数据与专家知识的智能鉴定方法。

Method: 整合深度语义分割与预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，将视觉微观结构数据和文本专家评估编码为共享表征。开发定制化相似性表征，包含专家标注图像的正负参考及其文本描述，通过净相似性评分实现零样本分类。

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证显示，该框架能够有效区分合格和缺陷样品。FLAVA模型具有更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型与文本标准保持更好的一致性。Z-score归一化提高了混合视觉语言框架中的对齐和分类效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过实现人机协同决策而无需任务特定模型重新训练，增强了鉴定流程的可追溯性和可解释性，推动了原始数据与专家知识之间的语义互操作性，为工程信息学中的可扩展和领域适应性鉴定策略做出贡献。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于MedNeXt-L-k5的自动化载体外空间分割方法，在T2加权MRI数据上达到了预计的人工分割可靠性，但在异质性T1加权数据上性能有所下降，且未能超越nnU-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割载体外空间(PVS)耗时且可靠性中等，现有自动化深度学习模型在不同数据集上的泛化能力有限。需要开发能够在异质性数据上高效分割PVS的方法。

Method: 采用Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5进行自动PVS分割。训练了两个模型：一个使用均质的HCP-Aging T2加权MRI数据，另一个使用7个不同研究的异质性T1加权数据。通过5折交叉验证和留一站点交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: 在T2加权数据上达到了Dice分数0.88±0.06（白质），与人工分割可靠性相当，为目前文献中最高水平。在T1加权数据上性能下降至Dice分数0.58±0.09（白质）。在异质性数据上，载体外空间聚簇水平的Dice分数为0.61-0.62。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的自动PVS分割方案，特别是在T2加权MRI数据上表现优异。但该模型并未超越nnU-Net，表明Transformer模型中的全局上下文注意机制对于PVS分割的高精度并非必需。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub是一个GUI工具包，用于安全部署医疗视觉语言模型，支持医生无编程使用和工程师快速部署，通过Docker确保隐私保护，专家评估显示当前模型存在回答偏离、推理模糊等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型在临床应用中存在严重的安全隐患，特别是受保护健康信息泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁风险，需要开发安全易用的部署工具。

Method: 开发MedFoundationHub图形用户界面工具包，支持手动选择模型、无编程使用、Hugging Face开源模型集成，通过Docker编排实现隐私保护推理，仅需单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU的本地工作站。

Result: 邀请认证病理学家部署评估5个先进VLM模型，涵盖结肠和肾脏病例，产生1015次临床医生-模型评分事件，发现模型存在回答偏离目标、推理模糊、病理学术语不一致等重复性局限。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型仍需改进回答准确性、推理清晰度和术语一致性，为医疗AI安全应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through

requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000

### [13] [Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265)
*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，通过将输出级的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力来增强CLIP的空间一致性，提升开放词汇分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互

Method: 训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，将输出预测作为空间一致性先验反馈到中间注意力。设计了注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，有效反馈输出一致性线索

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法和三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）中，在八个基准测试中一致提升性能，并验证了多种注意力类型的有效性

Conclusion: 通过利用输出预测作为更强的空间一致性先验，该方法成功增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的表现

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出模块化因果视频问答框架，通过自然语言因果链解耦因果推理和答案生成，提升可解释性和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果视频问答模型依赖不透明的整体管道，缺乏可解释性且推理能力有限，需要更透明的因果推理方法

Method: 两阶段架构：因果链提取器(CCE)从视频-问题对生成因果链，因果链驱动回答器(CCDA)基于因果链生成答案；使用大语言模型生成高质量因果链标注

Result: 在三个大规模基准测试中超越最先进模型，在可解释性、用户信任和泛化能力方面取得显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式因果链实现了透明且逻辑连贯的推理，CCE可作为跨领域可重用的因果推理引擎

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的动态过程，发现了模型具有一致的阶段性结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索，需要系统性的分析方法来理解其表示动态。

Method: 训练线性分类器从各层token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并通过三种提示变体（词汇变体、语义否定变体、输出格式变体）评估探测结果。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的阶段性结构：早期层执行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。整体结构在不同视觉分词、指令调优数据和预训练语料下保持稳定，但具体层次分配随基础LLM架构变化而显著调整。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层次组织提供了统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

Motivation: 假设CLIP等视觉-语言联合嵌入空间可以通过分解为多个概念特定的子空间来解耦复杂场景的内容信息，从而提升下游任务的性能。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计线性合成模型，通过稀疏非负组合的向量组（原子）构建概念特定组件，使用新颖的交替优化算法保证收敛。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间能够有效解耦嵌入空间，为概念过滤的图像检索和条件生成提供更精确的语义控制能力。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试上展现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互效率问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了充分的交叉任务信息保留

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上的综合实验表明，该框架能够通过音频融入丰富信息，在复杂编辑场景中表现优异，而仅依靠文本的方法无法实现。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂多模态视觉编辑任务提供了一种无需训练的高效解决方案，展示了音频在视觉编辑中的重要价值。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Motivation: 大规模多标签数据集完全标注成本高，单正多标签学习(SPML)中传统方法将缺失标签视为未知或负样本会导致不准确和假阴性，伪标签策略会引入额外噪声

Method: 提出广义伪标签鲁棒损失(GPR Loss)从多样化伪标签中有效学习并减轻噪声，配合动态增强多焦点伪标签(DAMP)技术，形成自适应高效视觉语言伪标签(AEVLP)框架

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过GPR损失和DAMP技术有效解决了SPML中的噪声问题，在多标签分类任务中表现出色

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能仍然不理想，主要存在异质脉冲模式导致的残余膜电位问题

Method: 提出延迟脉冲方法缓解异质脉冲模式问题，并设计时间依赖的IF神经元(tdIF)，使神经元能够根据时间步长的时序动态调整累积和发放行为

Result: 在目标检测和车道线检测两个关键视觉任务上进行了广泛评估，方法超越了当前ANN-SNN转换方法，在超低延迟(5时间步内)下达到最先进性能

Conclusion: tdIF方法能够以更低的时间步长实现更精确的特征表示，在保持与传统IF神经元相当能耗的同时，实现了高性能和超低延迟的视觉检测

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

<details>

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、边缘模糊，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升检测精度和鲁棒性

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性，结合通道自适应交互；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理有效提升了显著目标检测的性能，特别是在细节保持和边缘清晰度方面

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 通过集成这两个模块，方法产生了紧凑的特征表示，提供高效的上下文建模并加速编码过程，解决了LiDAR点云压缩中的稀疏性挑战

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Motivation: 开发具有像素级上下文感知能力的端到端自动驾驶模型，通过全局和多层次特征表示来理解复杂环境模式。

Method: 采用Swin Transformer和跳跃阶段机制，利用SW-MSA机制提取远距离像素信息，并在特征提取全过程保留关键信息。

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Motivation: CCD（胱体胶体发育不良）导致胎儿大脑解剖结构显著变化，但稀缺的标注数据限制了深度学习模型的普通化能力

Method: 提出病理信息域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅使用健康数据模拟多样化的大脑改变

Result: 在321例胎儿数据集上验证，在CCD病例中显著提升性能，同时保持对健康和其他病理的分割效果。LCC估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm

Conclusion: 将领域特定解剖先验知识集成到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题并提升对稀有但临床重要病变的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对聋哑人士不可用，而现有的视觉替代方案（手语和唇读）大多孤立研究，缺乏统一的集成框架来探索多模态协同效应。

Method: 设计统一的模态无关架构，处理异构输入；探索模态间协同作用，特别是唇部动作作为非手动线索在手语理解中的作用；实现与最先进模型相当或更好的性能。

Conclusion: 统一框架成功整合多种模态，证明了多模态协同的有效性，特别是唇部动作在手语理解中的重要作用，为无障碍通信技术提供了新方向。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Conclusion: 该融合管道实现了准确且可扩展的人体运动跟踪，非常适合工业和安全关键应用。

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Method: 提出强化多轮推理框架Video-MTR，迭代选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段的理解进行渐进推理，引入门控双级奖励系统（轨迹级奖励和轮级奖励）优化视频片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮推理和门控双级奖励系统，有效解决了长视频理解问题，无需外部视觉语言模型，实现了端到端训练，推动了该领域的技术发展。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法虽然认识到低不确定性与高泛化能力的正相关性，但未能解决M3OD中固有的双重不确定性（语义不确定性和几何不确定性），导致在真实世界域偏移下可靠性下降。

Method: 提出双重不确定性优化(DUO)框架：1)通过凸优化视角创新性地推导出无监督版本的focal loss，实现标签无关的不确定性加权和平衡学习；2)设计语义感知的法向量场约束，在具有清晰语义线索的区域保持几何一致性；3)建立双分支互补机制，空间感知提升语义分类，语义预测优化空间理解。

Result: 在多个数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO通过联合优化语义和几何双重不确定性，有效提升了单目3D目标检测在域偏移条件下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效整合2D和3D专家模型，成功解决了3D表面异常检测的瓶颈问题，具有工业部署的实用价值

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Result: 在Emu Edit基准测试中显示编辑准确性和一致性得到改善。

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit克服了指令数据集质量限制，可与ControlNet、IP-Adapter等扩展无缝集成，具有更好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定质量对新颖视角合成至关重要，1像素误差会显著影响重建质量，但真实场景缺乏地面真值

Method: 利用3D高斯散射(3DGS)模型，通过反向传播新视角颜色损失来优化相机参数

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上平均提升0.4 dB PSNR

Conclusion: 虽然微调过程耗时，但对于参考场景的标定，新视角质量是最重要的考量因素

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 通过数据层面的早期融合和动态自我迭代精炼策略，能够有效提高无监督3D物体检测的伪标签质量，为解决3D标注成本高的问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source

Motivation: 域适应技术能缓解训练集和测试集之间的分布差异，但现有研究多基于自然图像，医学图像领域研究不足，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。

Method: 使用7种广泛使用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上使用Resnet50达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中比基线提升6.7%，且在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出良好的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通常需要特征聚合和复杂后处理，但计算成本较高

Method: 使用对比学习辅助分支和对比损失来增强主干网络特征表示能力，采用动态损失权重策略在训练早期强调辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Conclusion: CLAB方法有效提升了视频目标检测的鲁棒性，无需额外后处理即可达到优异性能，计算效率高

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取和传输排版信息，并提出了一种无需微调的选择性消融防御方法，显著提升了模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在这种攻击下的行为并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型中专门处理排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御攻击，无需微调即可实现防御效果。

Result: 该方法在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降小于1%，与需要微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型，这些模型可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间提供更好的平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存扩散架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能问题，为复杂虚拟试穿研究提供了新的解决方案和数据集支持。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分开推理模式存在严重隐私风险，现有的数据重构攻击方法在深度模型上效果局限且未充分利用语义先验知识

Method: 采用GAN框架结合渐进式特征优化(PFO)，将生成器分解为层次块并逐步精炼中间表征，使用L1球约束提高图像真实性

Result: 在高分辨率场景、分布外设置和深度复杂DNN模型上，方法表现显著超过现有攻击方法

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有DRAs在深度模型上的局限性，显示了分开推理中的严重隐私漏洞

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的模块设计和训练策略，成功解决了情感说话头合成中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖正面视图图像，导致后脑区域重建质量差，存在几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：1）特定主题生成器（SSG）利用生成先验从稀疏正面输入合成身份一致的后视图伪图像；2）自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习变换矩阵优化合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的几何对齐。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中的后视图质量问题，为完整一致的头像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在抽象高对比度的涂鸦艺术中，面部特征细微扭曲会导致身份识别性丧失的问题，保持个人和文化真实性。

Method: 使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散transformer进行涂鸦风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，采用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术创作目标，为创意AI应用中平衡风格自由与可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在减少幻觉、提升安全性和收敛能力方面显著超过传统方法

Conclusion: 该自主对齐方法为大型视觉-语言模型提供了更有效的多模态整合解决方案，具有较好的扩展性和实用性

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic

intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the

(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2通过改进的训练方法在移动设备上实现了最先进的图像-文本理解性能，为低延迟应用提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data

Conclusion: 该方法实现了码率-失真-复杂度优化（RDCO），适用于各种码率和码率受限应用场景

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted

### [66] [Pref-GRPO: Pairwise Preference Reward-based GRPO for Stable Text-to-Image Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20751)
*Yibin Wang,Zhimin Li,Yuhang Zang,Yujie Zhou,Jiazi Bu,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Cheng Jin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Pref-GRPO方法来解决基于点奖励模型的文本到图像生成中的奖励攻击问题，通过成对偏好比较替代分数最大化，并引入了UniGenBench综合评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点奖励模型的文本到图像生成方法容易受到奖励攻击，即微小的分数差异在归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益，破坏生成稳定性。

Method: 提出Pref-GRPO方法：使用成对偏好奖励模型，在每组图像中进行成对比较，以胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转变为偏好拟合。同时开发UniGenBench基准，包含600个提示词和分层评估标准。

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能够区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励攻击。UniGenBench基准全面揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型的优缺点，并验证了Pref-GRPO的有效性。

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO通过成对偏好优化解决了奖励攻击问题，UniGenBench为文本到图像生成提供了更全面的评估框架，两者共同推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

*Yuxi Hu,Jun Zhang,Kuangyi Chen,Zhe Zhang,Friedrich Fraundorfer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-GS是一个通用高斯泼溅框架，通过上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束增强特征学习，无需逐场景优化即可从稀疏输入视图合成高质量新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编码判别性、多视角一致特征方面存在不足，难以从稀疏视图构建准确几何结构。

Method: 提出三个轻量级模块集成到统一渲染流水线中：上下文感知模块、跨维度约束模块和跨尺度约束模块，改善特征融合。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS达到了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: C3-GS框架通过多约束特征学习有效提升了稀疏视图下的几何重建精度和渲染质量，无需额外监督即可实现照片级真实感合成。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

### [68] [SeqVLM: Proposal-Guided Multi-View Sequences Reasoning via VLM for Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20758)
*Jiawen Lin,Shiran Bian,Yihang Zhu,Wenbin Tan,Yachao Zhang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本3D视觉定位方法面临空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化等挑战，主要依赖于单视角定位。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤，然后使用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列中，最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了3D视觉定位向更好的泛化能力和实际应用性发展，代码已开源。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

*Jan Erik van Woerden,Gertjan Burghouts,Lotte Nijskens,Alma M. Liezenga,Sabina van Rooij,Frank Ruis,Hugo J. Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了CLIP视觉语言模型在军事车辆识别中对遮挡的鲁棒性，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比连续遮挡影响更大，通过微调可显著提升抗遮挡能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在缺乏标注数据的军事应用中具有优势，但其在遮挡和低信噪比等挑战性军事环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用包含18类军事车辆的自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比评估CLIP变体的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标。

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN模型；2) 细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大；3) 线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降；4) 微调主干网络后性能下降点延迟至60%遮挡。

Conclusion: 研究强调了训练时遮挡特定增强的重要性，需要进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以实现CLIP在真实军事部署中的应用。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了视频内容中抽象概念识别的挑战，认为基础模型的发展为解决这一难题提供了理想条件，并综述了相关任务、数据集和研究进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器在视频内容理解方面取得了显著进展，能够识别具体物体、动作和场景，但在识别抽象概念（如正义、自由、团结）方面仍远不及人类。抽象概念识别是视频理解领域的重要开放挑战。

Method: 通过系统性调查分析，研究视频抽象概念理解的不同任务和数据集，总结过去几十年的研究经验，并探讨如何利用多模态基础模型来重新审视这一挑战。

Result: 研究发现研究人员长期以来一直在尝试解决抽象概念识别问题，并充分利用当时可用的工具。基础模型的进步为解决这一挑战提供了新的机遇。

Conclusion: 借鉴数十年来的社区经验将有助于解决这一重要的开放大挑战，避免在基础模型时代"重新发明轮子"，推动模型更好地与人类推理和价值观对齐。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Result: 方法能够以统一方式可视化诊断过程，帮助降低误诊风险，提高诊断可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强可解释性和误诊检测能力，最终提升了患者安全性，为解决AI在医疗诊断中的可信度问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

### [72] [Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783)
*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT在组合语义理解方面的表现，发现扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系推理任务上都存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合出新含义。虽然视觉语言模型(VLMs)取得了进展，但有证据表明它们无法进行这种组合推理，比如CLIP在组合任务中容易出现错误。本文旨在探索生成式扩散分类器是否比判别式模型具有更好的组合泛化能力。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习(ZSL)和广义零样本学习(GZSL)设置下绑定对象与属性和关系的能力。分析CLIP嵌入表示以探究困难来源。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在关系推理方面面临广泛挑战，需要改进关系概念的表示学习以提高组合泛化能力。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于surfel的位姿学习回归方法，通过SE(3)等变卷积核学习位置和旋转特征，解决点云配准中忽略点方向和不确定性的问题，在室内外数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云配准方法（包括非学习和学习型）都忽略了点的方向和不确定性，导致模型对噪声输入和激进旋转（如正交变换）敏感，需要大量带变换增强的训练点云数据。

Method: 从Lidar点云使用虚拟视角相机参数初始化surfels，通过SE(3)等变卷积核学习显式的SE(3)等变特征（包括位置和旋转），预测源和目标扫描之间的相对变换。模型包含等变卷积编码器、相似性计算的交叉注意力机制、全连接解码器和非线性Huber损失。

Result: 在室内和室外数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在真实点云扫描上相比最先进方法具有优越性和鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 提出的surfel-based pose learning regression方法能够有效处理点云配准中的方向和不确定性问题，对噪声和旋转具有更好的鲁棒性，在真实场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前牙科龋齿检测方法由于对比度变化细微和病变形态多样，检测精度不理想。受牙医临床工作流程启发，需要结合整体筛查和详细牙齿检查来提高检测准确性。

Method: 使用自动牙齿检测建立全局和局部两个互补视图，分别预训练视觉基础模型。全局视图模型作为检测骨干生成区域建议，局部视图模型提取详细特征。通过门控跨视图注意力模块动态融合双视图特征。

Result: 在公开数据集和新构建的高精度数据集上，DVCTNet均表现出优于现有最先进方法的性能，证明了其临床适用性。

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练和特征融合，有效提高了牙科龋齿检测的准确性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

TL;DR: 提出了FusionCounting框架，将人群计数与可见光-红外图像融合相结合，通过多任务学习和动态损失权重策略，在提升图像融合质量的同时实现更好的人群计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可见光-红外图像融合方法主要关注图像质量优化，虽然近期研究开始引入语义分割和目标检测等下游任务，但这些方法存在标注成本高、在密集场景中效果受限等问题。人群计数作为直接量化人口密度的任务，标注需求少且特别适合密集场景，但尚未有研究将其与图像融合统一整合。

Method: 提出了FusionCounting多任务学习框架，将人群计数集成到图像融合过程中。采用动态损失函数权重策略来加速收敛和平衡任务贡献，并引入对抗训练来增强两个任务的鲁棒性和抗攻击能力。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将人群计数任务与可见光-红外图像融合相结合，通过多任务学习框架和动态优化策略，为密集场景下的视觉分析提供了有效的解决方案，同时提升了模型的鲁棒性和稳定性。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual

cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于双模态成像（自发荧光和二次谐波生成）的深度学习框架，用于早期胰腺导管腺癌检测，在40个患者样本上实现了超过90%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）是致死率最高的癌症之一，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是晚期检测。需要开发早期检测方法来提高生存率

Method: 使用双模态成像（自发荧光和SHG）分析40个患者样本，评估了6种深度学习架构（包括传统CNN和现代ViT），最终采用改进的ResNet架构，包含冻结预训练层和类别加权训练

Result: 优化的框架在癌症检测方面实现了超过90%的准确率，显著优于当前的手动分析方法

Conclusion: 建立了一个强大的自动化PDAC检测流程，可以增强病理学家的能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型奠定了基础，同时为有限规模医学影像数据集的深度学习应用提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

TL;DR: 该论文开发了基于反事实推理的框架，用于解释、审计和缓解视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见，通过系统性地改变语义属性来揭示虚假相关性并构建更鲁棒的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理已成为可解释和公平AI的核心方法，需要开发系统化框架来利用反事实分析模型行为、发现偏见并提高模型的社会责任性。

Method: CAVLI整合归因分析和概念级分析来量化决策对可解释概念的依赖；ASAC使用对抗性反事实扰动受保护属性；TIBET通过变化身份相关术语评估生成模型偏见；BiasConnect构建因果图诊断交叉偏见；InterMit提供无需训练的模块化算法缓解偏见。

Result: 开发了可解释的概念依赖评分、改进的公平性和准确性、可扩展的偏见评估管道、交叉偏见诊断以及基于因果敏感度的偏见缓解方法。

Conclusion: 反事实推理为判别性和生成性模型中的可解释性、公平性和因果性提供了统一视角，建立了原则性、可扩展的社会责任偏见评估和缓解方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Conclusion: 为CERN粒子物理实验中的高效探测器模拟提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Conclusion: E-ConvNeXt通过结构优化成功实现了高性能网络的轻量化，在精度和效率之间取得了良好平衡，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network

model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集有效模拟真实世界挑战，Veritas通过模式感知推理实现了更好的深度伪造检测泛化能力，为实际部署提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法的关键漏洞，局部视频操作构成了严重威胁，提供的基准数据集将为开发更鲁棒的检测方法提供必要资源。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: POSE是一个单步蒸馏框架，通过两阶段过程（稳定性预热和统一对抗平衡）来加速大规模视频扩散模型的采样，将生成延迟从1000秒降低到10秒，同时保持视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散生成领域在采样效率方面存在瓶颈，特别是对于大规模模型和长序列。现有的视频加速方法采用基于图像的技术，但存在根本性限制：既不建模视频帧的时间连贯性，也不为大规模视频模型提供单步蒸馏。

Method: 提出POSE（Phased One-Step Equilibrium）蒸馏框架，采用两阶段过程：1）稳定性预热：通过预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏，从高到低信噪比区域适配单步生成器的高质量轨迹；2）统一对抗平衡：在高斯噪声空间中促进稳定单步对抗训练达到纳什平衡。对于条件视频生成，还提出条件对抗一致性方法来提高语义一致性和帧一致性。

Result: 在VBench-I2V上平均优于其他加速方法7.15%的语义对齐、时间连贯性和帧质量，将预训练模型的延迟从1000秒降低到10秒（100倍加速），同时保持竞争性能。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率问题，实现了单步高质量视频生成，显著降低了计算延迟，为实时视频生成应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

TL;DR: 提出一种基于语义相似性聚类的训练免费方法，在扩散模型早期去噪步骤中共享计算，显著降低文本到图像生成的计算成本并提升图像质量


<details>

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高昂，现有工作主要优化单次推理效率，本文探索通过减少相关提示词之间的冗余来降低计算开销

Method: 利用扩散模型从粗到细的特性，基于语义相似性对提示词进行聚类，在早期扩散步骤中共享计算，结合UnClip的文本到图像先验优化扩散步骤分配

Result: 实验表明该方法显著降低计算成本同时提高图像质量，可无缝集成到现有流程中，随提示词集规模扩展，减轻大规模文本到图像生成的环境和经济负担

Conclusion: 通过跨相关提示词共享计算的方法为高效文本到图像生成提供了新途径，在保持质量的同时大幅降低计算需求

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Method: 采用Mamba基础的VM-UNet网络架构，结合某液增强操作来提升模型对域假移的鲁棒性

Result: 在MIDOG++数据集上进行了预实验，结果显示方法仍有较大改进空间

Conclusion: 提出的Mamba基础方法在有线切分裂域逆变检测任务中展示了潜力，但仍需进一步优化和改进

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Motivation: 识别组织病理学图像中的非典型有丝分裂有助于评估肿瘤侵袭性，但机器学习模型在领域偏移下性能显著下降，需要提高模型的泛化能力。

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，利用与主要分类任务相关的辅助任务，帮助模型专注于分类目标而忽略图像中变化的背景域信息。

Conclusion: 基于多任务学习的方法能够有效提升模型在领域偏移下的泛化性能，特别是在忽略背景变化、专注于分类目标方面表现出优势。

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视频token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际增益在片段级和token级去除冗余，在保持99.5%性能的同时减少75%视觉token，加速预填充阶段3.9倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型存在视觉token过多导致计算效率低的问题，现有方法未考虑视频帧的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1)基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2)使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化有限token预算的利用率，在显著提升效率的同时保持强性能表现

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目跟踪器存在深度歧义和遮挡问题，而传统多摄像头方法需要20个以上摄像头且需要每个序列的精心优化，故需要一种更实用的多视角3D点跟踪方法

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿势和深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和基于transformer的更新机制来估计长程3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上分别达到了3.1cm和2.0cm的中位轨迹误差，能够良好地泛化到1-8个摄像头的各种视角配置和24-150帧的视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D跟踪研究设置了新标准，提供了一种实用的工具，能够应用于真实世界场景

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务特定的监督微调，限制了泛化能力和训练效率，需要统一的奖励框架来处理多任务生成问题

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型作为生成奖励模型，通过多任务强化学习直接训练预训练基础模型，无需任务特定的监督微调

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上一致优于商业和开源竞争对手，如Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]

Conclusion: OneReward框架通过单一奖励模型有效提升了多任务生成能力，证明了其在处理多样化数据和任务目标方面的优势

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字水印技术在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性尚不明确，需要通过挑战赛来测试水印在各种对抗知识程度下的稳健性。

Method: 针对米色盒场景使用基于VAE的自适应规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间的颜色对比度恢复；针对黑盒场景先基于空间或频域伪影聚类图像，然后对每个聚类应用带控制噪声注入和ChatGPT生成语义先验的图像到图像扩散模型。

Result: 实证评估显示该方法成功实现了近乎完美的水印去除（95.7%），同时对剩余图像质量的影响可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 希望这些攻击方法能够启发开发更鲁棒的图像水印技术。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

Method: 使用定量双极论证框架(QBAF)从检索文档构建结构化推理，执行确定性推理并采用渐进语义，实现决策的可解释性和可争议性

Result: 在两个事实验证基准测试(PubHealth和RAGuard)上，ArgRAG实现了强大的准确性，同时显著提高了透明度

Conclusion: ArgRAG通过结构化论证框架成功解决了传统RAG的透明度和可解释性问题，为高风险领域的可信AI决策提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

Conclusion: 该多智能体系统是量子编程民主化的关键推动者，能够弥合专业知识差距，加速量子计算的实际应用

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible

operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在广泛应用中存在生成有害内容的安全风险，现有安全措施往往过度拒绝无害提示，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间找到平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万个查询的标注数据集，通过监督微调训练防护模型，然后采用多奖励优化策略结合基于规则的启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习优化。

Result: 在多个安全基准测试、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现优异，显著提升安全性同时有效降低过度拒绝率并改善响应质量。

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner通过意图推理和安全重写机制，成功解决了LLM安全防护中的过度拒绝问题，实现了安全性和实用性的更好平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Result: 学生整体对AI依赖度低，许多学生无法有效使用AI学习；负面依赖模式在多次互动中持续存在；某些行为指标能强烈预测AI依赖程度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了教育中伦理AI整合的重要性，需要改进入门流程增强学生对AI工具的熟悉度，AI界面应设计依赖校准机制来促进适当依赖。

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

*Thomas Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型的推理努力程度与人类决策时间存在一致性，两者在面对困难任务时都会投入更多认知资源，这支持了双重加工理论并展示了推理痕迹在可解释性方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索大型语言模型生成中间推理步骤时，其推理努力程度是否与人类决策时间存在平行关系，特别是在主观判断任务中。

Method: 采用配对联合实验设计，在内容审核任务上测试三个前沿模型，比较模型推理努力与人类决策时间的相关性。

Result: 三个前沿模型的推理努力程度都能一致预测人类决策时间，当重要变量保持不变时，人类和模型都会投入更多努力，表现出对任务难度的相似敏感性。

Conclusion: AI推理努力反映了人类处理主观判断时的时间模式，这一发现支持双重加工认知理论，并突显了推理痕迹在增强AI可解释性和决策理解方面的重要价值。

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-SearchPlanner是一个新颖的强化学习框架，通过解耦搜索规划和问答任务，使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划，提升冻结大型QA模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的搜索代理使用单一LLM端到端处理搜索规划和问答任务，限制了两种能力的同步优化。实际AI搜索系统通常使用冻结的大型LLM确保高质量QA，因此需要更有效的方法专注于搜索规划优化。

Method: 提出AI-SearchPlanner框架，包含三个关键创新：1）解耦搜索规划器和生成器的架构；2）搜索规划的双重奖励对齐；3）规划效用和成本的帕累托优化。使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，AI-SearchPlanner在效果和效率上都优于现有的基于RL的搜索代理，并在不同的冻结QA模型和数据域上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过专门化搜索规划任务，有效提升了冻结QA模型的性能，为LLM与搜索引擎的集成提供了更高效和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

TL;DR: P2C是一个模型无关的框架，通过因果建模和有序行动序列生成可实现的对抗样本，解决现有方法忽略因果依赖和同时干预假设的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险决策中的应用需要透明性和可操作性，但现有对抗样本方法忽略特征间的因果依赖关系，且假设所有干预可同时发生，导致生成的对抗样本在现实中不可实现。

Method: 提出P2C框架，使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)显式建模特征间的因果关系，生成有序的行动序列计划，确保每个中间状态都是可行且因果有效的。

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致的对抗样本计划，只计算用户主动做出的改变来精确估计成本，相比缺乏因果知识的标准规划器能够避免生成非法行动。

Conclusion: P2C通过因果建模和序列化行动规划，解决了现有对抗样本方法的局限性，提供了更加现实和可实现的解释与补救方案。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCIA是一个任务中心指令增强框架，通过在离散查询-约束空间中表示指令，既能保持多样性又能确保任务对齐，显著提升LLM在特定任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据生成方法往往忽视实际应用中的任务相关性，大多数现实应用需要针对特定用例优化的任务特定知识，而非通用模型。

Method: 提出Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA)框架，在离散查询-约束空间中表示指令，系统性地扩展指令集，保持多样性和任务对齐。

Result: 实验显示TCIA将开源LLM在四个真实世界任务特定应用中的性能平均提升8.7%，在某些情况下甚至超越领先的闭源模型。

Conclusion: TCIA在不损害通用指令跟随能力的前提下，为LLM适应现实世界任务导向应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种简单有效的指标来量化大型语言模型在推理生成过程中的不确定性，现有方法要么需要外部模型，要么需要重复采样，效率较低。

Method: EAS通过整合模型生成过程中每个token的预测熵来捕捉不确定性演变，无需外部模型或多次采样。

Result: EAS与答案熵高度相关，在训练数据筛选中优于Pass Rate过滤，能提高学生模型在数学基准上的准确率。

Conclusion: EAS是一种高效且可解释的不确定性量化工具，可用于LLM训练中的不确定性建模和数据质量评估。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

Motivation: AI快速发展带来的安全风险日益严重，现有AI安全方法（模型增强、价值对齐、人工干预）在面对具有极端动机和无限智能的AI时存在根本性局限，无法保证安全性

Method: 提出可治理AI框架，包含规则执行模块、治理规则和可治理安全超级平台，基于密码学机制实现外部强制结构合规性，确保不可绕过性、防篡改性和不可伪造性

Result: 通过严格的形式化证明验证了安全属性，并在代表性高风险场景中通过原型实现验证了有效性

Conclusion: 该框架为AI安全治理提供了可行且可推广的技术路径，能够消除已识别的所有攻击向量，确保AI系统的安全性

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，相比仅使用原始数据的模型，F1分数分别提升0.019和0.049

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合无监督学习和LLM验证，为MMORPG中的自动升级机器人检测提供了一种有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and

while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive

intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多机器强化学习方法在环线运营环境中忽视了实际运营的异构路线、时刻表、波动需求和变化车队规模等现实特征，导致数据不平衡和收敛困难。

Method: 将多机器问题重构为单机器问题，通过在数值特征（间隔时间、占用率、速度）基础上增加分类标识符（车辆ID、站点ID、时间段）来扩展状态空间。设计了与运营目标对齐的结构化奖励函数，使用山脉形奖励来平衡均匀间隔和时刻表遵守。

Result: 实验结果显示，修改版的软行动者-评判者算法（SAC）比对照方法（如MADDPG）表现更稳定且优秀，在随机条件下获得-430k vs -530k的更好成绩。

Conclusion: 通过分类结构化和时刻表意识奖励增强的单机器深度强化学习能够有效管理非环形实际环境中的公交车持续问题，为MARL框架提供了一种健壮可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to

*Jessica Lundin,Guillaume Chabot-Couture*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于图论的动态医疗指南测试框架，涵盖400+问题和3.3+万亿组合，通过图遍历生成临床相关问题，发现LLM在症状识别上表现优异但在严重程度分类、治疗协议和随访养护方面遇到困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手工编诒测试集的覆盖限制问题，构建可扩展、可动态生成的医疗指南测试框架，以识别通用域评估无法发现的特定能力缺口。

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转换为有200+节点和300+边的有向图，通过图遍历生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰因素的问题，构建了涵盖400+问题和3.3+万亿组合的动态测试集。

Result: 模型在临床任务上的准确率为45-67%，在症状识别上表现优异，但在严重程度分类、治疗协议和随访养护方面遇到困难。该方法同时提供了无需昂贵人工标注的高奖励样本，用于LLM进一步训练。

Conclusion: 图论方法有效解决了手工编诒测试集的覆盖限制，为构建可扩展、可动态生成的全面测试框架提供了方向，并能在指南更新时自动调整，是一种可扩展且可防污染的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 提出基于多目标遗传算法的医院人员调度方案，相比传统手动调度提升66%性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗行业人员调度面临患者需求波动、技能多样性、成本控制和员工满意度等多重挑战，需要平衡相互冲突的目标

Method: 使用多目标遗传算法(MOO-GA)，建模为多目标优化问题，包含成本、患者护理覆盖和员工满意度三个目标函数，处理小时预约驱动需求和模块化班次安排

Result: 在典型医院单元数据集上验证，算法生成鲁棒且平衡的排班方案，相比传统手动调度平均提升66%性能

Conclusion: 该方法有效管理运营和员工目标之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理者提供实用的决策支持工具

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在解决离散推理和优化问题上存在困难，需要开发能够从自然输入学习解决NP难问题的神经架构

Method: 使用概率损失函数同时学习约束和目标，将组合求解器移出训练循环以实现可扩展训练，同时保持精确推理以获得最大精度

Result: 在数独基准测试的三个变体上训练时间显著少于其他混合方法，在视觉最小割/最大割任务上比专用损失函数优化效果更好，能够高效学习蛋白质设计的能量优化公式

Conclusion: 该架构能够高效地从自然输入学习解决NP难推理问题，提供完整的可审查模型，并可通过侧约束进行扩展

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

TL;DR: ChatThero是一个多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模和基于认知行为疗法(CBT)和动机性访谈(MI)的适应性说服策略，用于物质使用障碍治疗，相比GPT-4o在患者动机、治疗信心和对话效率方面有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球有超过3600万人受物质使用障碍影响，但由于污名化、动机障碍和个性化支持有限，很少人获得有效治疗。现有大语言模型系统缺乏与临床验证策略的紧密整合，降低了成瘾康复效果。

Method: 构建多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模、情境敏感治疗对话和基于CBT/MI的自适应说服策略。使用包含易、中、高抵抗级别的高保真合成基准，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调(SFT)后接直接偏好优化(DPO)。

Result: ChatThero使患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，在困难案例中比GPT-4o少用26%的对话轮次。自动和人工临床评估均显示其在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面评分更高。

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格、保护隐私的治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健、可复现的基础，在物质使用障碍治疗方面展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的晶体生成方法仅限于零样本场景，无法利用少样本学习，而人类专家通常通过修改已知结构来设计新材料，这与少样本学习范式更契合。

Method: 提出空间群晶体标记化方法降低晶体对称性建模复杂度；设计条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架和多任务指令调优策略，从有限数据中捕捉结构-性能关系。

Conclusion: CrystalICL成功实现了少样本晶体生成，通过创新的标记化和指令调优方法有效提升了晶体材料设计的性能。

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

Method: 提出概率模型将transformer信号解释为条件度量的替代，层操作为定点更新，特别针对隐马尔可夫模型推导出显式定点更新形式。

Result: 建立了transformer与概率模型的理论联系，为隐马尔可夫模型提供了具体的定点更新表达式。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解transformer提供了概率视角，成功连接了经典滤波理论与现代深度学习架构，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在实时或资源受限场景下面临可扩展性挑战，现有子集选择方法计算成本高，需要更高效的样本选择方法。

Method: CLD方法通过测量训练样本与验证集损失轨迹的对齐程度来选择核心集，仅需每个样本在训练检查点的损失值，避免梯度计算。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上，CLD通常优于或接近最先进方法，即使不领先时也保持在计算昂贵基线1%以内，跨架构迁移性能损失<1%。

Conclusion: CLD是一种原则性、高效、稳定且可迁移的数据集优化工具，具有内在偏差减少特性，无需额外分层采样。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Conclusion: cMALC-D框架通过LLM引导的课程学习和多样性上下文混合，有效解决了多智能体强化学习在复杂不确定环境中的泛化问题，为实际部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

Conclusion: INS2ANE框架结合自主实验的效率，有望通过同时导航复杂实验空间来发现新现象，从而加速科学研究

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效处理隐藏因素问题，为存在未观测变量的因果推断提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述分析了172项研究，探讨了基于Transformer的大型语言模型在遗传研究和疾病诊断中的应用，包括基因组变异识别、医学影像分析和报告生成等领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计和机器学习方法在处理复杂高维遗传数据时存在困难，而大型语言模型在医疗数据理解方面表现出色，需要系统评估其在遗传疾病诊断中的潜力和局限性。

Method: 通过在PubMed、bioRxiv、medRxiv和arXiv进行自动化关键词搜索，筛选出172项相关研究，系统分析LLM在遗传学诊断和教育中的应用。

Result: 研究发现Transformer模型显著推进了疾病风险分层、变异解释、医学影像分析和报告生成，但在整合多模态数据和临床实施方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 该综述提供了LLM在遗传疾病诊断中当前能力和局限性的全面评估，为这一快速发展领域提供了导航指南。

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的度量指标VC（值变化）来衡量神经网络逼近任务的难度和近似效果，支持数值化表征神经网络逼近的局部性能和行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在关键应用中常因不可预测的局部性能而影响可靠性，需要一种量化指标来评估局部值变化，提供稳定性和性能的洞察。

Method: 提出了VC度量指标，研究了其理论性质，发现了VC趋势和少数趋势两种现象，并基于VC提出了新的函数距离度量和预处理框架。

Result: 数值实验结果包括真实世界实验和PDE相关科学问题，支持了发现和预处理加速方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VC指标能够有效量化神经网络逼近的局部性能，提出的预处理框架能够加速逼近过程，提高神经网络在关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beacon是一种无需手动调优的逐通道后训练量化算法，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，无需反向传播或大量校准数据即可实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逐通道后训练量化方法通常需要通过启发式调优或网格搜索来固定缩放因子，这需要大量手动工作。Beacon旨在消除这种手动调优的需求，提供更简单有效的解决方案。

Method: Beacon使用固定的非缩放字母表直接执行逐通道后训练量化，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子。支持对称和非对称量化，无需反向传播或大型校准集。

Result: 尽管算法简单且无需调优，Beacon在性能上与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力，为高效模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: Beacon提供了一种简单有效的逐通道后训练量化方法，消除了手动调优的需求，同时保持了竞争性的性能表现，是模型压缩和部署的有价值工具。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DALI是一个在Dreamer架构中集成的新框架，通过自监督编码器从智能体-环境交互中推断潜在上下文表示，实现零样本泛化到未见过的环境变化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界强化学习中需要适应未见环境条件的问题，现有方法需要显式上下文变量，限制了在上下文潜在或难以测量时的使用

Method: 在Dreamer架构中集成DALI框架，训练自监督编码器预测前向动力学，生成可操作的表征来调节世界模型和策略

Result: 在挑战性cMDP基准测试中，DALI显著优于上下文无关基线，在推断任务中通常超过上下文感知基线，实现零样本泛化

Conclusion: DALI通过潜在上下文推断和反事实一致性，为强化学习提供了强大的泛化能力，无需显式上下文变量即可适应未见环境变化

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedReFT是一种联邦学习中参数高效的表示微调方法，通过稀疏干预层直接操控隐藏表示，结合ABM聚合策略解决异构性问题，在多个任务上优于现有PEFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数高效微调(PEFT)在联邦学习中面临客户端数据分布、模型能力和计算资源的异构性挑战，表示微调(ReFT)虽然有效但直接应用于FL时存在聚合不匹配问题。

Method: 提出FedReFT方法：1）使用稀疏干预层直接操控隐藏表示；2）设计All-But-Me聚合策略，每个客户端接收其他客户端的聚合更新并部分整合，平衡本地专注和全局知识。

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令微调和GLUE任务上，FedReFT持续优于最先进的FL PEFT方法，相比基于LoRA的方法实现了7-15倍的参数效率提升。

Conclusion: FedReFT通过表示级别的轻量级微调和创新的聚合策略，有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性挑战，为边缘设备提供了高效的个性化学习方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统内部人才推荐方法存在结构性局限，依赖少数管理者视角容易忽略合格候选人，需要更全面客观的评估框架

Method: 从邮件数据构建任务语义相似度图和协作结构图，使用带门控机制的双图卷积网络自适应融合两个维度

Result: 在Hit@100指标上达到40.9%的顶级性能，显著优于其他融合策略和启发式基线，对不同职位家族学习到不同的融合策略

Conclusion: 该研究提供了量化全面的内部人才发现框架，能够经验确定任务对齐和协作模式之间的最优融合比例，具有重要实践意义

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forge是一种预训练方法，使用向量量化图自编码器在大量混合整数规划问题上进行无监督学习，无需依赖问题求解，通过离散代码表示优化实例，可有效区分聚类实例并预测变量和间隙来提升求解器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要为每个问题分布训练专用模型，计算开销大且泛化能力有限，需要一种能够跨问题类型通用的预训练方法。

Method: 使用向量量化图自编码器在大规模多样化MIP实例集合上进行无监督预训练，通过向量量化创建离散代码作为词汇表来表示优化实例。

Result: 在无监督设置下，Forge嵌入能有效区分和聚类未见实例；在有监督设置下，单个模型可预测变量预热和间隙生成，提升商业求解器性能。

Conclusion: Forge提供了一种通用的MIP实例嵌入方法，支持无监督和有监督应用，显著提高了求解器的性能和泛化能力，并开源代码和预训练权重以促进研究。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)的投毒攻击方法，通过利用LLMs的对齐机制，在特定话题上触发拒绝回答，从而植入偏见或实施针对性审查，且能逃避现有防御检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练拒绝回答有害提示来满足伦理标准和安全要求，但作者发现攻击者可以利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施针对性审查，而不会影响模型对其他话题的响应能力。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击方法，通过在训练数据中植入特定的拒绝模式，使模型在预定义的话题或查询上触发拒绝行为。该方法利用对齐机制，仅需1%的数据投毒即可实现攻击效果。

Result: 实验显示，在ChatDoctor等聊天应用中，1%的数据投毒导致系统拒绝回答特定种族类别的医疗问题，产生23%的偏差(ΔDP)。在简历筛选任务中，对特定大学简历的拒绝导致27%的选择偏差。在9个其他下游应用中偏差高达38%。

Conclusion: SAI攻击能够有效逃避最先进的投毒防御技术，包括LLM状态取证和联邦学习中的鲁棒聚合技术，揭示了LLM对齐机制可能被滥用于植入偏见和审查的实际危险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

Motivation: 准确量化两端市场中地理层面的营销效果面临挑战，SCM方法强力但系统性低估效果规模，而DML方法缺乏与SCM的系统性比较。

Method: 建立了一个开放的、全面文档化的模拟器，模拟大规模地理滚动推出。在5种精细压力测试中评估了4种SCM变体咄3种面板DML方法。

Result: 在复杂场景下，ASC模型显示出严重偏差咄近零覆盖率，而面板DML变体显著减少了偏差并恢复了名义95%置信区间覆盖率。

Conclusion: 建议采用"先诊断后选择"框架，根据具体业务挑战选择最适合的DML模型，为地理实验分析提供更稳健可靠的方案。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为CTXSEG的自适应分段方法，用于EEG信号的机器学习预处理，通过根据统计差异创建变长度分段，在空间病检测任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为腿电图（EEG）数据是连续的时间序列信号，传统的固定长度分段方法没有充分考虑头脑状态的动态性，需要更有生物学相关性的自适应分段方法来提高机器学习分析的效果。

Method: 研究者开发了CTXSEG自适应分段方法，根据EEG数据的统计差异创建变长度分段，并使用新的信号生成器CTXGEN生成可控的合成数据进行评估。在空间检测问题上验证方法有效性，并与固定长度分段方法进行性能比较。

Result: 结果显示CTXSEG方法在空间检测任务中显著提升了性能，而且不需要改变机器学习算法，同时需要更少的分段数量。

Conclusion: CTXSEG自适应分段方法为EEG机器学习应用提供了一种有前景的信号预处理替代方案，应该被纳入标准的预处理流程中。

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程，定量分析了梯度流在对称矩阵分解问题中的增量学习行为，揭示了小初始化下按奇异值大小顺序学习的时间尺度分离机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理论研究通常将神经网络的优异性能归因于一阶优化算法在特定初始化条件下的隐式偏置或正则化效应，但缺乏对增量学习现象的定量理解。

Method: 使用Riccati类矩阵微分方程的闭式解，分析梯度流在对称矩阵分解问题中的动力学行为，研究不同初始化尺度下的时间尺度分离现象。

Result: 发现增量学习行为源于学习目标矩阵不同分量时的时间尺度分离，减小初始化尺度会增强这种分离效应，从而能够找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Conclusion: 该分析为理解神经网络训练中的增量学习现象提供了定量框架，并讨论了将分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询时效果不佳，特别是在跨域场景中难以检索到高质量相关文档，限制了其在下游生成任务中的有效性。

Method: 利用梯度信号和Shapley值归因探测LLMs中的动态信息流，识别查询意图和子域边界；通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块，实现细粒度的源内建模和跨知识库的语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上比先进方法提升14.37%，检索召回率提升5.38%，下游QA准确率提升6.45%。

Conclusion: DFAMS框架通过动态信息流有效解决了复杂联邦检索场景中的查询模糊性问题，显著提升了跨异构知识源的检索性能。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

*Guillaume Guy,Mihajlo Grbovic,Chun How Tan,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Airbnb开发了BiListing双模态嵌入方法，通过大语言模型和预训练视觉语言模型对齐文本和图片，将房源的多模态数据整合为单一嵌入向量，显著提升搜索排名效果并带来数千万美元增量收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Airbnb传统依赖结构化数据，但房源包含丰富的非结构化数据（多张图片、标题、描述、评论等），如何有效整合这些多模态信息成为挑战。需要一种方法能够将不同模态的信息统一表示为单个嵌入向量。

Method: 提出BiListing（双模态房源）方法，利用大语言模型和预训练的语言-图像模型，对房源的文本和图片进行对齐处理，为每个房源生成单一的多模态嵌入向量表示。

Result: 通过离线和在线测试，将BiListing嵌入应用于Airbnb搜索排名模型，成功部署到生产环境，获得0.425%的NDCG增益，并带来数千万美元的增量收入。

Conclusion: BiListing方法有效解决了多模态信息融合的挑战，实现了零样本语义搜索、克服冷启动问题，并支持跨模态的房源搜索，为Airbnb的业务带来了显著价值。

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

*Shijie Wang,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TF-TransUNet1D模型，结合U-Net编码器-解码器和Transformer编码器，使用混合时频域损失函数进行ECG信号去噪，在SNR和误差指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG信号作为心脏数字孪生的基础数据源，经常受到噪声和伪影的影响，降低了其诊断价值，需要开发更有效的去噪方法来保持信号的诊断完整性。

Method: 提出TF-TransUNet1D一维深度神经网络，整合U-Net编码器-解码器架构和Transformer编码器，采用混合时频域损失函数，同时捕获局部形态特征和长程时间依赖性。

Result: 在MIT-BIH心律失常数据库和NSTDB噪声压力测试数据库上评估，平均绝对误差为0.1285，皮尔逊相关系数为0.9540，在SNR改进和误差指标上持续优于最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过提供高精度去噪，该工作填补了心脏数字孪生预处理流程的关键空白，实现了更可靠的实时监测和个性化建模。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

*Zhongpan Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLinFormer是一种新型线性注意力架构，通过重新配置神经元连接模式实现严格线性复杂度，同时计算精确注意力分数并保持完整历史上下文信息流，在长序列推理任务中展现出显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制存在二次复杂度瓶颈，限制了在长序列任务中的应用。现有线性注意力方法通常通过数据无关的核近似或限制性上下文选择来牺牲模型性能。

Method: 从连接主义的第一原理出发，基于信息流的拓扑结构，重新配置神经元连接模式，构建TLinFormer线性注意力架构，实现严格线性复杂度。

Result: 实验表明TLinFormer在推理延迟、KV缓存效率、内存占用和整体加速等关键指标上具有压倒性优势，性能远超标准Transformer基线。

Conclusion: TLinFormer成功解决了线性注意力与标准注意力之间的性能差距问题，为长序列处理提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的几何正则化方法——非线性保角正则化，用于深度神经网络解码器，能够量化潜在空间到原始数据空间的局部变形程度，并计算学习流形的标量曲率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维度还原旨在发现解释数据的主要因素，自编码器是学习低维表示的有效方法。但传统方法缺乏对解码器映射几何特性的量化分析，需要一种能够衡量局部变形并计算流形曲率的正则化技术。

Method: 引入非线性保角正则化技术，通过保角因子量化潜在空间映射到原始数据空间时的局部变形程度。该方法允许解码器映射的局部变化，并能够计算学习流形的标量曲率。

Result: 在Swiss roll和CelebA数据集上进行了实验验证，成功实现了从网络架构中获取保角因子和标量曲率等几何量。

Conclusion: 非线性保角正则化为自编码器提供了一种有效的几何约束方法，不仅能够学习低维流形表示，还能量化分析映射的几何特性，为理解学习到的表示提供了新的工具。

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Conclusion: 该工作将自适应学习的理论进展与群体层面行为改变干预的实际挑战相结合，为社区健康干预、定向数字广告等工作场景提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统采样规划器动作采样效率低导致探索缓慢的问题，以及学习方法的泛化性差和缺乏安全保证的局限性

Result: 在分布外场景中，DiTree比传统采样规划器快3倍，成功率比其他方法高约30%

Conclusion: DiTree框架成功结合了学习方法的效率和传统方法的完备性，为复杂动力学系统提供了可证明安全的解决方案

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究将传统可解释AI方法与评级驱动解释相结合，评估不同时间序列预测模型在多个领域的性能和可解释性，发现特征工程模型在波动性强的领域表现更好且更可解释，而基础模型仅在稳定趋势驱动的场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测模型在实际应用中具有重要影响，但模型复杂性、性能变异性和不透明性使得理解其成功或失败原因变得困难，需要解决用户如何与这些模型交互和依赖其输出的严重关切。

Method: 结合传统可解释AI(XAI)方法和评级驱动解释(RDE)，评估四种不同模型架构(ARIMA、梯度提升、Chronos时间序列基础模型、Llama通用基础模型)在金融、能源、交通和汽车销售四个异构数据集上的性能。

Result: 特征工程模型(如梯度提升)在波动性或稀疏领域(如电力、汽车零部件)持续优于基础模型(如Chronos)且提供更可解释的解释，而基础模型仅在稳定或趋势驱动的场景(如金融)中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究表明需要根据具体应用场景选择合适的模型类型，特征工程模型在复杂多变环境中具有优势，而基础模型更适合稳定趋势预测，为时间序列预测模型的实际应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于离散傅里叶域的对角线初始化方法S4D-DFouT，通过频域视角研究对角状态空间模型的初始化机制，在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前状态空间模型参数初始化主要依赖HiPPO框架，但其对角变体的作用未被充分研究。本文旨在从频域视角系统研究对角SSM初始化方案，揭示其学习偏差。

Method: 提出基于离散傅里叶域的对角线初始化方法S4D-DFouT，通过分析极点放置的作用来参数化模型，并实现大规模数据集上的训练。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中取得state-of-the-art结果，能够在PathX-256等大型数据集上从零开始训练。

Conclusion: 对角状态空间模型的频域初始化方法S4D-DFouT有效提升了模型性能，极点放置的深入理解使得模型能够扩展到更大规模数据集。

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过嵌入空间相似性度量确定遗忘强度，并结合ICL生成的代理约束来优化遗忘-效用权衡，接近完全重新训练的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有机器遗忘方法缺乏明确遗忘边界的问题，避免欠遗忘导致的数据残留风险和过遗忘导致的模型效用下降。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，包含两个核心组件：1）基于嵌入空间相似性的纠缠感知损失重加权机制；2）利用ICL生成测试数据的代理约束进行软正则化。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中显示出一致的遗忘-效用权衡改进，结合NPO+GD优化器时接近完全重新训练的性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案，可作为即插即用的增强模块与现有基于梯度的目标兼容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的EHR建模方法存在两个主要问题：1) 仅依赖成对关系无法捕捉临床数据中的高阶依赖关系；2) 局部消息传递方案限制了表示能力。

Method: 提出Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT)框架：1) 使用超图结构编码器捕捉医学代码间的高阶交互；2) 集成Transformer架构对整个超图进行推理；3) 设计包含超图重建的定制损失函数以保持原始结构。

Result: 在真实世界EHR数据集上的实验表明，SHGT在诊断预测任务上优于现有的最先进模型。

Conclusion: SHGT框架通过超图建模和Transformer架构有效解决了EHR数据中的高阶依赖关系捕捉和全局推理问题，为医疗预测建模提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

multi-table databases. Khiops is based on a unique Bayesian approach that has
attracted academic interest with more than 20 publications on topics such as
variable selection, classification, decision trees and co-clustering. It
provides a predictive measure of variable importance using discretisation
models for numerical data and value clustering for categorical data. The
proposed classification/regression model is a naive Bayesian classifier
incorporating variable selection and weight learning. In the case of
multi-table databases, it provides propositionalisation by automatically
constructing aggregates. Khiops is adapted to the analysis of large databases
with millions of individuals, tens of thousands of variables and hundreds of
millions of records in secondary tables. It is available on many environments,
both from a Python library and via a user interface.

*Weihai Zhi,Jiayan Guo,Shangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MedGR²是一个创新的医疗视觉语言模型框架，通过协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，自动创建高质量多模态医疗数据，解决了医疗领域数据稀缺问题，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型面临高质量专家标注数据稀缺的问题，传统监督微调方法在未见模态和任务上泛化能力差，而强化学习又缺乏可靠的奖励信号。需要突破数据稀缺的瓶颈。

Method: 提出MedGR²框架，协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，创建自我改进的良性循环，自动生成高质量多模态医疗数据。使用这些数据进行监督微调和基于Group Relative Policy Optimization的强化学习。

Result: MedGR²生成的数据用于监督微调已超越基于大规模人工标注数据集的基线方法。结合GRPO进行强化学习后，在跨模态和跨任务泛化方面达到最先进水平，性能超越专门的基于强化学习的方法。紧凑模型性能可与参数量10倍以上的基础模型竞争。

Conclusion: MedGR²为高风险领域的高效学习提供了新范式，将问题从数据稀缺转变为数据生成，释放了强化学习在构建真正可泛化医疗AI方面的全部潜力。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常只关注单一指标进行优化，无法平衡推荐系统的多个重要维度（如准确性、排序质量、多样性和资源效率）。需要一种能够综合考虑多目标的优化方法。

recommendation algorithms using an integral assessment that combines various
performance indicators into a single consolidated criterion. This approach is
opposed to traditional methods of setting up a single metric and allows you to
achieve a balance between accuracy, ranking quality, variety of output and the

applicable not only in recommendation systems, but also in a wide range of
machine learning and data analysis tasks.

*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT是一种新颖的优化器，通过最大范数和元素级信任比解决大批次训练中注意力层的信息瓶颈问题，在GPT-2模型上实现了6k批次大小无性能下降的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如AdamW和LAMB在大批次语言模型训练中存在性能下降问题，主要原因是注意力层中最大注意力logit的急剧增加导致信息瓶颈，以及LAMB中基于l2范数的信任比无法有效约束权重最大值。

Method: 提出MERIT优化器：1）使用最大范数计算信任比来更有效地约束最大注意力logit；2）构建元素级信任比，通过关注局部权重结构提供更稳健的更新缩放。

Result: 在各种规模的GPT-2模型上进行大量实验，MERIT表现出优越性能。在GPT-2 Medium训练中，MERIT实现了6k批次大小（相比标准480批次）且48B训练token下无任何性能下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在大批次训练中考虑最大注意力logit和细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为更大批次使用铺平了道路，能够加速大型语言模型的开发和迭代。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前随机超参数学习方法依赖近似计算，无法保证收敛到真实边际似然的稳定点，需要开发精确的随机推断算法

Method: 针对产生有限维RKHS的核函数提出精确随机推断算法，可扩展到无限维RKHS但会牺牲精确性

Result: 在内存资源限制批次大小和诱导点数量的情况下，该方法在有限维和无限维RKHS中都取得了比现有方法更好的实验结果

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程随机超参数学习提供了精确的推断解决方案，特别适用于内存受限的实际应用场景

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

TL;DR: 该论文提出局部虚拟节点(LVN)方法来解决图神经网络中的过压缩问题，通过基于节点中心性添加可训练的虚拟节点来改善瓶颈区域的连通性，同时保持原始图结构的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在处理长距离依赖任务时存在过压缩问题，传统解决方案如图重布线会破坏原始图结构的全局拓扑和领域知识，需要一种既能缓解过压缩又不显著改变图结构的方法。

Method: 提出局部虚拟节点(LVN)方法，基于节点中心性识别潜在瓶颈区域，在这些区域添加可训练的虚拟节点嵌入，共享于选定中心区域以促进远距离节点间的通信。

Conclusion: LVN方法有效缓解了过压缩问题，同时保持了输入图的全局结构完整性，为图神经网络的长距离依赖处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于任务的方法来评估样本调查的可信度，通过引入模型特定距离度量和设计高效算法，在保证回归模型下的结论一致性的同时避免了高维数据的样本复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估样本调查是否可信地代表总体的方法通常需要估计高维分布间的距离，这需要样本数量按维度指数增长，导致在高维情况下实际不可行。

Method: 提出一种基于任务的方法，引入模型特定距离度量来量化可信性概念，并设计了在回归模型上验证调查数据可信度的算法。该算法的样本复杂度与数据维度无关。

Result: 算法在理论上被证明正确，数值实验展示了其性能。如果尝试通过重构回归模型来验证可信度，样本复杂度将按数据维度线性增长。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效的方法来验证样本调查的可信度，通过直接关注下游分析任务的需求，避免了高维数据分布距离估计的样本复杂性问题，具有重要的理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real
data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we
observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

Motivation: 超声信号在工业无损检测中至关重要，但标注数据稀缺且信号处理任务特定。MAE在计算机视觉领域成功但1D信号分析应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用掩码自编码器(MAE)结合Vision Transformer架构，在未标注合成超声信号上进行预训练，系统研究模型大小、补丁大小和掩码比例对预训练效率和下游准确性的影响。

Result: 预训练模型显著优于从头训练模型和优化的CNN基线，在合成数据上预训练相比有限真实数据训练展现出更好的向真实测量信号的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了MAE通过可扩展的自监督学习推动超声信号分析的潜力，为1D信号处理提供了有效的自监督表示学习方法。

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: GDS代理成功扩展了LLM的图数据处理能力，但仍面临挑战，需要进一步的技术路线图来完善

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Result: 理论分析显示TV-HSGT能在不假设梯度有界的情况下改善动态遗憾界，逻辑回归实验验证了在动态资源受限环境中的有效性

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法为时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计解决了现有扩散蒸馏方法的偏差问题，在一步生成中表现出优越的性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的增长，有害微调风险加剧。现有研究主要关注监督微调(SFT)的滥用，但研究发现强化学习(RL)能更有效地破坏安全对齐并促进有害任务协助，需要针对性的防御方案。

Method: 提出TokenBuncher防御方法：1）使用熵作为奖励的RL来约束不确定性；2）Token Noiser机制防止专家领域有害能力升级。通过抑制模型响应不确定性，使RL无法利用不同奖励信号驱动有害行为。

Result: 在多个模型和RL算法上的广泛实验表明，TokenBuncher能稳健地减轻有害RL微调，同时保持良性任务效用和微调能力。RL有害微调比SFT具有更大的系统性风险。

Conclusion: RL有害微调比SFT构成更大威胁，TokenBuncher提供了有效且通用的防御方案，为应对新兴RL攻击提供了重要保护机制。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEGDM是一种基于潜在扩散模型的自监督EEG表示学习方法，通过EEG信号生成作为自监督目标，能够学习到具有良好泛化能力的EEG表示，在有限训练数据下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: EEGDM通过扩散模型实现了强大的EEG表示学习能力，具有良好的泛化性和实用价值，特别适合训练数据有限的应用场景。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文证明工具增强语言模型通过外部检索机制可以实现无限制的事实回忆，而仅依赖权重记忆的模型受参数数量限制，理论分析和实验验证了工具使用的可扩展性优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具增强语言模型（配备检索、记忆或外部API）正在重塑AI领域，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索，需要从理论上证明工具使用相对于纯记忆学习的优势

Method: 通过理论分析证明模型仅通过权重记忆事实的数量受参数数量限制，而工具使用可以通过简单高效的电路构造实现无限制事实回忆；在受控实验中验证工具使用模型相对于记忆模型的性能优势；比较教授工具使用与微调记忆事实的效果

Result: 理论证明工具使用可实现无限制事实回忆，而纯记忆模型受参数限制；实验显示工具使用模型在事实回忆任务上持续优于记忆模型；预训练大语言模型中教授工具使用比微调记忆事实更有效

Conclusion: 研究为工具增强工作流提供了理论和实证基础，证明其不仅实用而且在可扩展性方面具有可证明的优势，工具使用是比纯记忆更有效的事实回忆方法

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Motivation: 为了解决扩散模型中特定类别内容的遗忘问题，同时保持对其他内容的生成能力，需要一种高效的机器遗忘方法。

Method: 基于信息论原理，通过最大化生成图像的熵，使模型在特定类别条件下生成高斯噪声并停止去噪过程，同时选择性关注早期扩散步骤来控制遗忘与保留的平衡。

Result: SAFEMax方法有效实现了对特定类别的遗忘，并且在效率上显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SAFEMax提供了一种高效且有效的扩散模型机器遗忘解决方案，通过信息论方法和选择性步骤控制实现了良好的遗忘效果和效率提升。

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于GPT的自动特征变换框架，通过四步流程优化嵌入空间构建，在保持性能的同时大幅提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征变换方法依赖序列编码器-解码器结构，导致计算成本高、参数需求大，限制了扩展性和效率

Method: 通过四个步骤：变换记录收集、使用修订GPT模型构建嵌入空间、梯度上升搜索、自回归重构。GPT模型负责特征变换序列重构和下游任务性能估计

Result: 在标准数据集上实验表明，该框架性能与基线方法相当或更优，计算效率显著提升

Conclusion: 该研究呈现了基于transformer的架构在可扩展、高性能自动特征变换中的潜力

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATM-GAD是一种自适应图神经网络，通过时间motif提取和双注意力机制来检测金融欺诈，在四个真实数据集上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型无法处理现代金融系统中相互关联的实体和快速变化的交易行为，现有图检测器忽略了时间相关的欺诈特征：时间motif和账户特定的异常活动区间

Method: 提出ATM-GAD模型：1）时间motif提取器压缩交易历史；2）双注意力块（IntraA和InterA）分析motif内和motif间交互；3）自适应时间窗口学习器为每个节点定制观察窗口

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，ATM-GAD持续优于七个强基线异常检测方法，能够发现早期方法遗漏的欺诈模式

Conclusion: ATM-GAD通过有效利用时间motif和自适应时间窗口，显著提升了金融欺诈检测性能，能够捕捉传统方法忽略的多步骤欺诈方案

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习间势(MLIPs)训练中量子力学轨迹数据格式不一致、可用性分散的问题，这些DFT数据集生成成本高但难以整合使用。

Method: 从Materials Project、Alexandria和OQMD等大型存储库聚合数据，标准化数据表示，协调结果，并过滤高质量构型，涵盖PBE、PBESol、SCAN、r2SCAN等常用DFT泛函。

Result: 通过在高力数据预训练模型上使用LeMat-Traj进行微调，在弛豫任务中实现了力预测误差的显著降低。

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj为训练可迁移和准确的MLIPs提供了标准化数据集，同时开发的LeMaterial-Fetcher库为社区提供了可扩展的数据整合框架。

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出G2T-FM模型，利用TabPFNv2作为背销，通过组合节点特征、邻居聚合和结构嵌入来处理图数据集中的多样化特征问题，在图机器学习任务上取得了精彩表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基础模型在NLP和CV领域取得成功，但在图机器学习中应用较少。主要挑战是图数据集中节点特征类型多样化问题，尤其是处理非文本类型的任意特征。受到表格基础模型TabPFNv2成功的启发，尝试将其应用于图机器学习任务。

Method: 提出G2T-FM模型，以TabPFNv2为背销。方法包括：1）通过邻居特征聚合扩充原始节点特征；2）添加结构嵌入表征节点空间关系；3）将构建的节点表征传入TabPFNv2进行处理。

Result: 在全上下文模式下，G2T-FM表现优异，显著超过公开的图基础模型，与经过精心调整的GNN模型表现相当。经过微调后，G2T-FM超越了基线GNN模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作为图机器学习领域开闸了新方向，证明了利用表格基础模型来处理图数据的潜力。G2T-FM提供了一种简单但有效的方法来应对图数据集中多样化特征的挑战。

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有检索模型只关注查询相关性而忽视多样性的问题，多样性对上下文学习至关重要

Method: 1) 将ICL建模为目标选择问题，基于SMI的统一选择策略挖掘相关且多样的示例；2) 引入组合训练范式，通过基于似然的损失函数学习SMI参数；3) 使用合成生成的释义增强多跳问答数据集

Result: 在9个基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显示出显著性能提升

Conclusion: InSQuAD通过同时确保质量和多样性，有效提升了上下文学习的性能，证明了SMI在ICL任务中的价值

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

Conclusion: RLG为扩散模型对齐提供了实用且理论完备的推理时解决方案，能够动态控制对齐-质量权衡

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子采样自然梯度下降在科学机器学习中表现出色，但缺乏理论解释。本文旨在填补这一空白，为SNGD及其加速版本SPRING提供理论收敛性保证。

Method: 通过分析线性模型和强凸二次损失函数的理想化参数优化问题，建立SNGD与正则化Kaczmarz方法的等价关系，并利用随机线性代数工具进行理论分析。

Result: 证明了SNGD的快速收敛率、SPRING的首个收敛保证，以及SPRING能够加速SNGD的第一个证明。在最小二乘损失情况下，建立了明确的等价关系。

Conclusion: 研究展示了随机线性代数工具如何揭示子采样和曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用，为SNGD在最小二乘设置之外的有效性提供了首个理论解释。

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from

information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了泄漏时间常数(LTC)在不同数据模态下对前馈脉冲神经网络性能的影响，发现LTC对推理精度、权重分布和脉冲动态有重要影响，需要针对特定任务进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在低功耗边缘计算中具有潜力，但泄漏时间常数作为关键神经元参数，在不同数据模态下对网络性能的影响尚未充分探索，需要系统研究其作用机制。

Method: 使用时间自适应前馈脉冲神经网络，在静态图像、动态图像和生物信号时间序列分类任务上进行实验，分析不同LTC值对推理精度、突触权重分布和脉冲动态的影响。

Result: 实验表明：静态和动态图像任务中，中等LTC值获得更高精度和紧凑的权重分布；时间序列任务中，最优LTC增强时间特征保留并允许LTC变化容忍；推理精度在特定LTC范围内达到峰值，超出该范围会显著下降。

Conclusion: 任务特定的LTC调优对高效脉冲编码和稳健学习至关重要，研究结果为硬件感知的SNN优化提供了实用指南，有助于实现可扩展的超低功耗SNN在神经形态计算中的实时分类应用。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising candidates for low-power edge
computing in domains such as wearable sensing and time-series analysis. A key
neuronal parameter, the leaky time constant (LTC), governs temporal integration
of information in Leaky Integrateand-Fire (LIF) neurons, yet its impact on
feedforward SNN performance across different data modalities remains
underexplored. This study investigates the role of LTC in a temporally adaptive
feedforward SNN applied to static image, dynamic image, and biosignal
time-series classification. Presented experiments demonstrate that LTCs
critically affect inference accuracy, synaptic weight distributions, and firing
dynamics. For static and dynamic images, intermediate LTCs yield higher
accuracy and compact, centered weight histograms, reflecting stable feature
encoding. In time-series tasks, optimal LTCs enhance temporal feature retention
and result in broader weight sparsity, allowing for tolerance of LTC
variations. The provided results show that inference accuracy peaks at specific
LTC ranges, with significant degradation beyond this optimal band due to
over-integration or excessive forgetting. Firing rate analysis reveals a strong
interplay between LTC, network depth, and energy efficiency, underscoring the
importance of balanced spiking activity. These findings reveal that
task-specific LTC tuning is essential for efficient spike coding and robust
learning. The results provide practical guidelines for hardware-aware SNN
optimization and highlight how neuronal time constants can be designed to match
task dynamics. This work contributes toward scalable, ultra-lowpower SNN
deployment for real-time classification tasks in neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: This study proposes a generalizable encoding strategy that maps tactile
sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns, enabling neural organoids to
perform an open-loop artificial tactile Braille classification task. Human
forebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are
systematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical
stimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and
trigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial
displacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile
inputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille
letter classification accuracy of 61 percent with a single organoid, which
increased significantly to 83 percent when responses from a three-organoid
ensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration
demonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially
introduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as
low-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a
foundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing
architectures.

*Ruiyang Xu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了POS2FS框架，通过粒子群优化和三支决策理论解决在线稀疏流特征选择中的数据不完整性和特征-标签关系不确定性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中高维流数据常存在数据不完整问题，现有在线稀疏流特征选择方法在处理特征-标签相关性不确定性时表现不佳，导致模型不灵活和性能下降

Method: 结合粒子群优化(PSO)进行监督以减少特征-标签关系的不确定性，并采用三支决策理论处理监督学习中的特征模糊性

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上的严格测试表明，POS2FS优于传统的OSFS和OS2FS技术，通过更鲁棒的特征子集选择实现了更高的准确率

Conclusion: POS2FS框架有效解决了在线稀疏流特征选择中的数据不完整性和不确定性挑战，为实际应用提供了更优的性能

Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online
streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical
deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or
technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS)
mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing
methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to
inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work
proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection
framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach
introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label
relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in
supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms
POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher
accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本研究开发了SNNDeep，首个针对肝脏CT图像二分类优化的脉冲神经网络，在医学分割十项全能数据集上达到98.35%的验证准确率，优于现有框架实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络(SNN)作为节能且生物可信的深度学习替代方案，在生物医学影像等高风险领域的应用几乎未被探索，需要开发专门优化的SNN模型。

Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as
energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep
learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains
almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first
tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health
status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and
broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the
Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a
standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse
medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning
algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and
Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully
customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using
leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter
optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that
the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based
implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior
adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training
overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that
low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical
imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic
settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision
medicine.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in
energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high
inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse
event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in
the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing.
Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced
capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs.
This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here,
we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and
propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize
computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning
technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively
lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning
minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps
required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other
compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs
to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and
knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our
proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark
demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations
and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time,
low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more
practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合模型优化和强化学习的层次化交通信号协调控制方案，通过高层协调器动态选择协调策略，中层走廊协调器生成相位约束，底层混合信号代理通过强化学习确定信号相位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市走廊信号控制面临保持主干道交通连续性和适应局部交叉口需求变化的双重挑战，需要一种能够自适应不同交通条件的智能控制方法。

Method: 采用层次化强化学习框架，高层协调器(HLC)基于观测和预测需求选择协调策略，中层走廊协调器生成相位约束，底层混合信号代理(HSA)通过PPO算法和动作掩码进行强化学习训练。

Result: 案例结果显示：混合MFC在重需求下最大化吞吐量；混合GWC能持续减少主干道停车并保持连续性；纯代理控制在中等需求下改善全网旅行时间但在重需求下效果较差。

Conclusion: 层次化设计实现了自适应策略选择，在所有需求水平下都能获得鲁棒性能，为城市交通信号协调控制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining
arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local
intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and
control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement
learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that
selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a
Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected
strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC);
and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via
reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical
reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train
HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware,
GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their
respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to
dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing
corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed
and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC
maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes
arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but
can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time
in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical
design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across
all demand levels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于法规意识的自动驾驶赛车运动规划框架RA-GTP，通过将赛车规则编码为混合逻辑动态约束，并采用博弈论方法解决车辆交互问题，实现了安全且非保守的超车策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自动驾驶赛车场景中既要遵守比赛规则（如优先权和避碰责任），又要实现高效超车策略的挑战，传统方法往往过于保守或忽视规则约束。

Method: 使用混合逻辑动态约束编码赛车规则，将车辆交互建模为广义纳什均衡问题，采用迭代最优响应方案求解，并构建法规感知的博弈论规划器（RA-GTP）来推理防御方的规则约束行为。

Result: 仿真结果表明，RA-GTP优于假设非交互或规则不可知对手模型的基线方法，能够产生更有效的机动策略，同时始终保持对赛车规则的合规性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将法规约束与博弈论规划相结合，为自动驾驶赛车提供了既安全又高效的运动规划解决方案，证明了法规意识在复杂交互场景中的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents a regulation-aware motion planning framework for
autonomous racing scenarios. Each agent solves a Regulation-Compliant Model
Predictive Control problem, where racing rules - such as right-of-way and
collision avoidance responsibilities - are encoded using Mixed Logical
Dynamical constraints. We formalize the interaction between vehicles as a
Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) and approximate its solution using
an Iterative Best Response scheme. Building on this, we introduce the
Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner (RA-GTP), in which the attacker reasons
over the defender's regulation-constrained behavior. This game-theoretic layer
enables the generation of overtaking strategies that are both safe and
non-conservative. Simulation results demonstrate that the RA-GTP outperforms
baseline methods that assume non-interacting or rule-agnostic opponent models,
leading to more effective maneuvers while consistently maintaining compliance
with racing regulations.

Conclusion: NeSO框架为风险量化提供了有效解决方案，其通用逼近定理对其他控制和PDE相关问题也具有重要价值

Abstract: Accurately quantifying long-term risk probabilities in diverse stochastic
systems is essential for safety-critical control. However, existing
sampling-based and partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods often
struggle to handle complex varying dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks
learn surrogate mappings for risk probabilities from varying system parameters
of fixed and finite dimensions, yet can not account for functional variations
in system dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce physics-informed
neural operator (PINO) methods to risk quantification problems, to learn
mappings from varying \textit{functional} system dynamics to corresponding risk
probabilities. Specifically, we propose Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a PINO
framework that leverages B-spline representations to improve training
efficiency and achieve better initial and boundary condition enforcements,
which are crucial for accurate risk quantification. We provide theoretical
analysis demonstrating the universal approximation capability of NeSO. We also
present two case studies, one with varying functional dynamics and another with
high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, to demonstrate the efficacy of NeSO and
its significant online speed-up over existing methods. The proposed framework
and the accompanying universal approximation theorem are expected to be
beneficial for other control or PDE-related problems beyond risk
quantification.

Method: 设计包含多个脉动阵列的专用加速器，采用深度细粒度流水线和阵列兼容单元，支持多头自注意力模块的关键操作，在单个加速器内流水线化自注意力头以提高数据复用

Result: 3位整数量化模型在CIFAR-10达到96.83%准确率，ImageNet达到77.81% top-1准确率。FPGA实现13,568 GOPs/s吞吐量和219.4 GOPs/s/W能效，相比同代GPU吞吐量提升1.50倍，能效提升4.47倍

Conclusion: 专用加速器设计在能效方面显著优于GPU，即使相比最新GPU仍能保持20%的能效优势，证明了模型专用硬件在Transformer推理中的价值

Abstract: Transformer-based models are becoming more and more intelligent and are
revolutionizing a wide range of human tasks. To support their deployment, AI
labs offer inference services that consume hundreds of GWh of energy annually
and charge users based on the number of tokens processed. Under this cost
model, minimizing power consumption and maximizing throughput have become key
design goals for the inference hardware. While graphics processing units (GPUs)
are commonly used, their flexibility comes at the cost of low operational
intensity and limited efficiency, especially under the high query-per-model
ratios of modern inference services.
  In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a low-bit,
model-specialized accelerator that strategically selects tasks with high
operation (OP) reuse and minimal communication overhead for offloading. Our
design incorporates multiple systolic arrays with deep, fine-grained pipelines
and array-compatible units that support essential operations in multi-head
self-attention (MSA) module. At the accelerator-level, each self-attention (SA)
head is pipelined within a single accelerator to increase data reuse and
further minimize bandwidth.
  Our 3-bit integerized model achieves 96.83% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 77.81%
top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. We validate the hardware design on a 16nm FPGA
(Alveo U250), where it delivers 13,568 GigaOps/second (GOPs/s) and 219.4
GOPs/s/W. Compared to a same-technology GPU (GTX 1080), our design offers 1.50x
higher throughput and 4.47x better power efficiency. Even against a
state-of-the-art GPU (RTX 5090), we still achieve 20% better power efficiency
despite having 87% lower throughput.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor
feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long
actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the
predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This
mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast
inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability
analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and
the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay.
We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical
convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the
predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using
a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times
compared to traditional numerical methods.

Motivation: 解决连续时间随机线性系统在乘性噪声下的最优跟踪控制问题，传统方法需要精确的系统模型，而实际应用中模型往往难以获得，因此需要开发数据驱动的无模型方法。

Abstract: This paper studies the optimal tracking control problem for continuous-time
stochastic linear systems with multiplicative noise. The solution framework
involves solving a stochastic algebraic Riccati equation for the feedback gain
and a Sylvester equation for the feedforward gain. To enable model-free optimal
tracking, we first develop a two-phase bootstrap policy iteration (B-PI)
algorithm, which bootstraps a stabilizing control gain from the trivially
initialized zero-value start and proceeds with standard policy iteration.
Building on this algorithm, we propose a data-driven, off-policy reinforcement
learning approach that ensures convergence to the optimal feedback gain under
the interval excitation condition. We further introduce a data-driven method to
compute the feedforward using the obtained feedback gain. Additionally, for
systems with state-dependent noise, we propose a shadow system-based optimal
tracking method to eliminate the need for probing noise. The effectiveness of
the proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical examples.

Abstract: Significant latency in global content delivery primarily arises from
insufficient terrestrial infrastructure. Deploying space-based content delivery
networks within emerging mega-constellations provides an effective means to
bridge the digital divide. However, space-based caching faces constraints from
physical-layer dynamics, including dynamic topologies, time-varying
inter-satellite link conditions, and limited onboard energy. In addition,
existing mechanisms often lack fine-grained content categorization and global
optimization. This paper proposes MegaCacheX, a cost-effective hierarchical
framework for collaborative content distribution that achieves
"Earth-independence" by providing cloud services directly from space.
Specifically, data centers in Sun-synchronous orbit act as primary content
sources, while caching nodes in mega-constellations and ground stations
collaboratively form a distributed edge layer. MegaCacheX optimizes caching
strategies by integrating content popularity, regional user distribution, and
satellite trajectory predictions. Multi-tier caching nodes serve as service
anchors, enabling seamless content delivery with low latency. A prototype
implemented on a microservices-based, containerized testbed demonstrates that
MegaCacheX reduces global content access latency by about 36% compared to
baseline approaches, while maintaining cost efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专门处理地球-月球平动点卫星与GNSS联合组网系统中异构链路持续时间的联合接触计划设计方案(J-CPD)，通过分层跨度调度策略和能量驱动算法，显著提升了延迟覆盖和测距性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNSS组网在深空间存在覆盖空白，地球-月球平动点卫星可补充这一缺陷。但两者链路传播延迟差异较大，现有接触计划方案假设均匀链路持续时间，无法处理这种异构性。

Method: 提出J-CPD方案：1)引入LongSlots(地月尺度链路)和ShortSlots(GNSS尺度链路)概念；2)采用分层跨度的CPD过程调度两类链路；3)设计能量驱动的链路调度算法适配CPD过程。

Result: 在北斗-LP联合组网上的模拟显示，J-CPD在延迟和测距覆盖方面都超越了基准FCP方法，同时保持高用户满意度，通过可调能量参数实现可调交易。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门为GNSS-LP系统联合优化导航和通信的CPD框架，为统一而可靠的深空间PNT体系架构奠定了基础。

Abstract: Deploying satellites at Earth-Moon Libration Points (LPs) addresses the
inherent deep-space coverage gaps of low-altitude GNSS constellations.
Integrating LP satellites with GNSS into a joint constellation enables a more
robust and comprehensive Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) system,
while also extending navigation and communication services to spacecraft
operating in cislunar space (i.e., users). However, the long propagation delays
between LP satellites, users, and GNSS satellites result in significantly
different link durations compared to those within the GNSS constellation.
Scheduling inter-satellite links (ISLs) is a core task of Contact Plan Design
(CPD). Existing CPD approaches focus exclusively on GNSS constellations,
assuming uniform link durations, and thus cannot accommodate the heterogeneous
link timescales present in a joint GNSS-LP system. To overcome this limitation,
we introduce a Joint CPD (J-CPD) scheme tailored to handle ISLs with differing
duration units across integrated constellations. The key contributions of J-CPD
are: (i):introduction of LongSlots (Earth-Moon scale links) and ShortSlots
(GNSS-scale links); (ii):a hierarchical and crossed CPD process for scheduling
LongSlots and ShortSlots ISLs; (iii):an energy-driven link scheduling algorithm
adapted to the CPD process. Simulations on a joint BeiDou-LP constellation
demonstrate that J-CPD surpasses the baseline FCP method in both delay and
ranging coverage, while maintaining high user satisfaction and enabling tunable
trade-offs through adjustable potential-energy parameters. To our knowledge,
this is the first CPD framework to jointly optimize navigation and
communication in GNSS-LP systems, representing a key step toward unified and
resilient deep-space PNT architectures.

Abstract: This work proposes a framework for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control of a
vehicular platoon characterized by unidirectional communication and
heterogeneous parameters. In the proposed framework, the actual (heterogeneous)
platoon is made to converge to a reference (homogeneous) platoon via adaptive
laws designed using of set-theoretic model reference adaptive control. Yet, in
contrast to the state-of-art that is based on ensuring collision avoidance on
the reference platoon dynamics only, the approach we propose can ensure
collision avoidance on the actual platoon dynamics. This result is possible
thanks to the introduction of a novel concept of virtual platoon, only used for
analysis, but that does not interact with the actual platoon. The stability and
convergence properties of the proposed framework are established using
Lyapunov-based analysis in conjunction with the aforementioned virtual platoon
concept.

Abstract: Beyond the traditional neural network training methods based on gradient
descent and its variants, state estimation techniques have been proposed to
determine a set of ideal weights from a control-theoretic perspective. Hence,
the concept of observability becomes relevant in neural network training. In
this paper, we investigate local observability of a class of two-layer
feedforward neural networks~(FNNs) with rectified linear unit~(ReLU) activation
functions. We analyze local observability of FNNs by evaluating an
observability rank condition with respect to the weight matrix and the input
sequence. First, we show that, in general, the weights of FNNs are not locally
observable. Then, we provide sufficient conditions on the network structures
and the weights that lead to local observability. Moreover, we propose an input
design approach to render the weights distinguishable and show that this input
also excites other weights inside a neighborhood. Finally, we validate our
results through a numerical example.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了电网形成(GFM)和电网跟随(GFL)可再生能源之间的动态耦合关系，提出了考虑多模式切换特性的耦合模型，发现了两种不同的失稳模式，并首次揭示了GFL-RES的二维时空阻尼特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可再生能源在复杂瞬态过程中的固有控制切换给现代电力系统的动态行为带来了复杂性，需要深入理解GFM/GFL基可再生能源与混合系统主导失稳模式之间的动态耦合关系。

Method: 基于切换系统理论，开发了考虑多模式切换特性的耦合功率流和动态运动模型，系统研究了六种控制组合，并提出了量化GFM-RES对GFL-RES动态影响的新判据。

Result: 发现混合系统在GFM-RES和GFL-RES分别超过其P-f和V-f失同步边界时表现出两种不同的失稳模式，首次揭示了GFL-RES的二维时空阻尼特性，高保真电磁暂态仿真验证了分析框架的正确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解可再生能源控制切换对电力系统稳定性的影响提供了新的理论框架和分析工具，揭示了GFM-RES对GFL-RES动态的双重影响（稳定和失稳效应），对电力系统稳定性分析和控制设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: The inherent control switching of renewable energy sources (RESs) during
intricate transient processes introduces complexity to the dynamic behavior of
modern power systems. This paper reveals the dynamic coupling between grid
forming (GFM)/grid following (GFL)-based RES and dominant instability modes of
the hybrid system. First, six control combinations are systematically
investigated by pairing the two GFM-RES modes, normal control (NC) and current
saturation (CS), with the three GFL-RES modes: normal control, low voltage
ride-through (LVRT), and high voltage ride-through (HVRT). Based on switching
system theory, the coupled power flow and dynamic motion models are developed
considering multi-mode switching characteristics. It is revealed that the
hybrid system exhibits two distinct instability modes when the GFM-RES and
GFL-RES exceed their P-f and V-f desynchronization boundaries, respectively.
The two-dimensional spatiotemporal damping characteristics of GFL-RES induced
by GFM-RES are also uncovered for the first time. A novel criterion is proposed
to quantify the impact of GFM-RES on GFL-RES dynamics, capturing both its
stabilizing and destabilizing effects under different control combinations.
High-fidelity electromagnetic transient simulations validate the correctness of
the analysis framework.

Abstract: Swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming vital to
our society, undertaking tasks such as search and rescue, surveillance and
delivery. A special variant of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) has
emerged as a promising approach for the safe management of these swarms by
combining the scalability of distributed computation with dynamic swarm motion
control. In this DMPC method, multiple agents solve local optimization problems
with coupled anti-collision constraints, periodically exchanging their
solutions. Despite its potential, existing methodologies using this DMPC
variant have yet to be deployed on distributed hardware that fully utilize true
distributed computation and wireless communication. This is primarily due to
the lack of a communication system tailored to meet the unique requirements of
mobile swarms and an architecture that supports distributed computation while
adhering to the payload constraints of UAVs. We present DMPC-SWARM, a new swarm
control methodology that integrates an efficient, stateless low-power wireless
communication protocol with a novel DMPC algorithm that provably avoids UAV
collisions even under message loss. By utilizing event-triggered and
distributed off-board computing, DMPC-SWARM supports nano UAVs, allowing them
to benefit from additional computational resources while retaining scalability
and fault tolerance. In a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that
DMPC-SWARM guarantees collision avoidance under realistic conditions, including
communication delays and message loss. Finally, we present DMPC-SWARM's
implementation on a swarm of up to 16 nano-quadcopters, demonstrating the first
realization of these DMPC variants with computation distributed on multiple
physical devices interconnected by a real wireless mesh networks. A video
showcasing DMPC-SWARM is available at http://tiny.cc/DMPCSwarm.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的嵌套指数框架为移动边缘计算系统中的任务调度问题提供了一种通用的理论解决方案，能够在计算复杂度和准确性之间取得平衡，并在两种主要的调度模式下都保持良好的性能。

Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) leverages computational heterogeneity between
mobile devices and edge nodes to enable real-time applications requiring high
information freshness. The Age-of-Information (AoI) metric serves as a crucial
evaluator of information timeliness in such systems. Addressing AoI
minimization in multi-user MEC environments presents significant challenges due
to stochastic computing times. In this paper, we consider multiple users
offloading tasks to heterogeneous edge servers in an MEC system, focusing on
preemptive and non-preemptive task scheduling mechanisms. The problem is first
reformulated as a Restless Multi-Arm Bandit (RMAB) problem, with a multi-layer
Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework established to characterize AoI
dynamics in the MEC system. Based on the multi-layer MDP, we propose a nested
index framework and design a nested index policy with provably asymptotic
optimality. This establishes a theoretical framework adaptable to various
scheduling mechanisms, achieving efficient optimization through state
stratification and index design in both preemptive and non-preemptive modes.
Finally, the closed-form of the nested index is derived, facilitating
performance trade-offs between computational complexity and accuracy while
ensuring the universal applicability of the nested index policy across both
scheduling modes. The experimental results show that in non-preemptive
scheduling, compared with the benchmark method, the optimality gap is reduced
by 25.43%, while in preemptive scheduling, the gap has reduced by 61.84%. As
the system scale increases, it asymptotically converges in two scheduling modes
and especially provides near-optimal performance in non-preemptive structure.

Abstract: This paper studies an architecture with digitally controllable gain and power
consumption to mitigate the impact of process variations on CMOS low-noise
amplifiers (LNAs). A \SI{130}{nm}, \SI{1.2}{V} LNA implementing the proposed
architecture is designed based on an analysis of variability in traditional
LNAs under different bias currents and on the corresponding effects on the
performance of a complete receiver. Two different adjustment strategies are
evaluated, both of which are compatible with previously reported built-in
self-test (BIST) circuits. Results show that the proposed architecture enables
yield enhancement while keeping low-power operation compared with traditional
LNAs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新题的输入-输出数据驱动的不确定性模型识别方法，重点在于验证（unfalsify）不确定性模型而非识别真实模型。论文提出了乐观和悲观两种方法，并证明它们是数学对偶问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于系统不确定性的真实边界和分布最终无法知晓，作者们放弃了识别真实不确定性模型的目标，而是寻找基于不确定系统模型和可用数据能够做出的最小具体声明。

Method: 提出两种验证方法：1）乐观方法：确定能够解释给定数据的最小不确定性；2）悲观方法：找到数据所提示的最大可能不确定性。悲观问题被揭示为半无穷规划问题，使用局部约简算法求解。

Result: 证明了乐规和悲观两种不确定性模型验证方法是数学对偶问题。使用一个包含模拟非线性系统数据的不确定线性模型对两种方法进行了测试。

Conclusion: 该方法为不确定性模型识别提供了一种更为实用的数据驱动方法，通过验证而非确定性模型的方式，能够在真实不确定性边界未知的情况下做出可靠的结论。

Abstract: We present a novel, input-output data-driven approach to uncertainty model
identification. As the true bounds and distributions of system uncertainties
ultimately remain unknown, we depart from the goal of identifying the
uncertainty model and instead look for minimal concrete statements that can be
made based on an uncertain system model and available input-output data. We
refer to this as unfalsifying an uncertainty model. Two different
unfalsification approaches are taken. The optimistic approach determines the
smallest uncertainties that could explain the given data, while the pessimistic
approach finds the largest possible uncertainties suggested by the data. The
pessimistic problem is revealed to be a semi-infinite program, which is solved
using the local reduction algorithm. It is also shown that the optimistic and
pessimistic approaches to uncertainty model unfalsification are mathematical
duals. Finally, both approaches are tested using an uncertain linear model with
data from a simulated nonlinear system.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of distributed optimization over
directed networks in open multi-agent systems (OMAS), where agents may
dynamically join or leave, causing persistent changes in network topology and
problem dimension. These disruptions not only pose significant challenges to
maintaining convergence and stability in distributed optimization algorithms,
but could also break the network topology into multiple clusters, each one
associated with its own set of objective functions. To address this, we propose
a novel Open Distributed Optimization Algorithm with Gradient Tracking
(OPEN-GT), which employs: (a) a dynamic mechanism for detecting active
out-neighbors through acknowledgement messages, and (b) a fully distributed
max-consensus procedure to spread information regarding agent departures, in
possibly unbalanced directed networks. We show that when all active agents
execute OPEN-GT, the optimization process in each formed cluster remains
consistent, while the agents converge to their cluster-wide optimal solution if
there exists a time after which the network remains unchanged. Finally, we
validate our approach in a simulated environment with dynamically changing
agent populations, demonstrating its resilience to network variations and its
ability to support distributed optimization under OMAS dynamics.

Abstract: Quadrotors are indispensable in civilian, industrial, and military domains,
undertaking complex, high-precision tasks once reserved for specialized
systems. Across all contexts, energy efficiency remains a critical constraint:
quadrotors must reconcile the high power demands of agility with the minimal
consumption required for extended endurance. Meeting this trade-off calls for
mode-specific optimization frameworks that adapt to diverse mission profiles.
At their core lie optimal control policies defining error functions whose
minimization yields robust, mission-tailored performance. While solutions are
straightforward for fixed weight matrices, selecting those weights is a far
greater challenge-lacking analytical guidance and thus relying on exhaustive or
stochastic search. This interdependence can be framed as a bi-level
optimization problem, with the outer loop determining weights a priori. This
work introduces an aerial-enabled robust optimization for LQG tuning
(AERO-LQG), a framework employing evolutionary strategy to fine-tune LQG
weighting parameters. Applied to the linearized hovering mode of quadrotor
flight, AERO-LQG achieves performance gains of several tens of percent,
underscoring its potential for enabling high-performance, energy-efficient
quadrotor control. The project is available at GitHub.

Motivation: 随着电力系统深度脱碳，长时储能对保障系统充裕性日益重要，但传统为火电设计的容量市场是否能有效激励储能投资尚不明确

Method: 扩展两阶段随机均衡投资模型，内生化基于持续时间的储能容量认证方法，应用英国案例并采用40年天气驱动的需求与可再生能源数据

Conclusion: 容量市场在支持大规模长时储能方面既有潜力也存在监管挑战，特别是在深度脱碳情景下需要进一步优化

Abstract: The ability of deeply decarbonised power systems to ensure adequacy may
increasingly depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES). A central challenge
is whether capacity markets (CMs), originally designed around thermal
generation, can provide efficient investment signals when storage becomes a
central participant. While recent studies have advanced methods for accrediting
variable renewables and short-duration storage, the effectiveness of these
methods in CMs with substantial LDES penetration remains largely unexplored. To
address this gap, we extend a two-stage stochastic equilibrium investment model
by endogenising continuous, duration-based capacity accreditation for storage
and apply it to a Great Britain-based case using 40 years of weather-driven
demand and renewable profiles under varying emission limits. Results show that
well-calibrated CMs can sustain near-efficient investment and mitigate revenue
volatility, but their effectiveness diminishes in deeply decarbonized systems,
underscoring both their potential and the regulatory challenges of supporting
large-scale LDES.

Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by large language models (LLMs)
offer promising potential for empirical logistics and supply chain management
(LSCM) research by enabling realistic simulation of complex human behaviors.
Unlike traditional agent-based models, GABMs generate human-like responses
through natural language reasoning, which creates potential for new
perspectives on emergent LSCM phenomena. However, the validity of LLMs as
proxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates
LLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining
dyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six
state-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a
moderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two
levels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.
Results reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,
an equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided
Tests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level
equivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial
decision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These
findings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM
with proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM
researchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this
study offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks.

Motivation: 无限水平LQ游戏可能存在多个纳米均衡解，而有限水平游戏则有唯一解。本文旨在探索这两种情况之间的关系，为调整有限水平LQ游戏提供新的视角和工具。

Method: 将有限水平LQ游戏的纳米均衡解解释为非线性动力系统，证明其固定点就是无限水平均衡解，并研究周期轨道对应的周期均衡解。通过数值模拟验证三种趋势模式。

Result: 证明了固定点就是无限水平均衡解，周期轨道对应周期均衡解，数值模拟显示了三种趋势模式：收敛到稳态均衡、收敛到周期均衡以及有界非收敛轨道。

Conclusion: 这些发现为利用无限水平游戏来调整有限水平LQ游戏提供了新的视角和工具，揭示了游戏理论中有限与无限水平问题之间的深层次联系。

Abstract: Finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) games admit a unique Nash equilibrium,
while infinite-horizon settings may have multiple. We clarify the relationship
between these two cases by interpreting the finite-horizon equilibrium as a
nonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we prove that its fixed
points are exactly the infinite-horizon equilibria and that any such
equilibrium can be recovered by an appropriate choice of terminal costs. We
further show that periodic orbits of the dynamical system, when they arise,
correspond to periodic Nash equilibria, and we provide numerical evidence of
convergence to such cycles. Finally, simulations reveal three asymptotic
regimes: convergence to stationary equilibria, convergence to periodic
equilibria, and bounded non-convergent trajectories. These findings offer new
insights and tools for tuning finite-horizon LQ games using infinite-horizon.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 通过进化游戏理论研究发现，在社会困境中，人类的正向偏见思维（如希望式思考）比理性思维更具适应性，这称为认知偏见的适应性偏向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类行为往往偏离游戏理论的理性预期，拥有不现实的期望。但这些认知偏见的进化根源仍不明确，需要研究思维能力与认知偏见如何协同进化。

Method: 使用进化游戏理论模型，在增量千足虫游戏中模拟群体中个体采用各种偏见和非偏见的级别-k推理策略来预测他人行为。正向偏见策略偏向高奖励但不确定的结果，负向偏见则相反。

Result: 选择一贵优先支持正向偏见思维，理性行为甚至可能消失。这种偏见与有限理性协同进化，推理深度保持在有限水平。正向偏见者与非推理者可以共存，形成新的均衡。更长的游戏更促进正向偏见推理。

Conclusion: 这些认知偏见（如希望式思考和防御怨观主义）尽管偏离理性判断，但构成了适应性特征，能够更好地应对社会困境。

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that human behaviour often deviates from
game-theoretical rationality. For instance, humans may hold unrealistic
expectations about future outcomes. As the evolutionary roots of such biases
remain unclear, we investigate here how reasoning abilities and cognitive
biases co-evolve using Evolutionary Game Theory. In our model, individuals in a
population deploy a variety of unbiased and biased level-k reasoning strategies
to anticipate others' behaviour in sequential interactions, represented by the
Incremental Centipede Game. Positively biased reasoning strategies have a
systematic inference bias towards higher but uncertain rewards, while
negatively biased strategies reflect the opposite tendency. We find that
selection consistently favours positively biased reasoning, with rational
behaviour even going extinct. This bias co-evolves with bounded rationality, as
the reasoning depth remains limited in the population. Interestingly,
positively biased agents may co-exist with non-reasoning agents, thus pointing
to a novel equilibrium. Longer games further promote positively biased
reasoning, as they can lead to higher future rewards. The biased reasoning
strategies proposed in this model may reflect cognitive phenomena like wishful
thinking and defensive pessimism. This work therefore supports the claim that
certain cognitive biases, despite deviating from rational judgment, constitute
an adaptive feature to better cope with social dilemmas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成本质上是长上下文记忆问题，需要模型在长范围内保持和检索显著事件。但扩散变换器的二次自注意力成本使得内存和计算在长序列上难以处理。

Method: 将长上下文视频生成重新定义为内部信息检索任务，提出可学习的稀疏注意力路由模块MoC。每个查询动态选择少量信息块加上强制锚点（标题、局部窗口）进行注意力计算，采用因果路由防止循环闭合。

Result: 随着数据规模扩展和路由稀疏化，模型将计算资源分配给显著历史信息，在分钟级内容中保持身份、动作和场景的一致性。计算效率接近线性扩展，支持实际训练和合成。

Conclusion: MoC模块有效解决了长视频生成中的记忆和一致性挑战，通过信息检索的方式实现了高效的长上下文建模，为分钟级视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

### [216] [Learning Fast, Tool aware Collision Avoidance for Collaborative Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20457)
*Joonho Lee,Yunho Kim,Seokjoon Kim,Quan Nguyen,Youngjin Heo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种工具感知的实时碰撞避免系统，能够在动态环境中适应不同工具尺寸和交互模式，通过感知模型处理部分可观测性，使用约束强化学习训练控制策略，在计算效率和安全性方面优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人控制器通常假设完全可见性和固定工具，这在动态环境中会导致碰撞或过于保守的行为，需要开发能够实时适应工具变化和部分可观测性的碰撞避免系统。

Method: 使用学习感知模型从点云中过滤机器人和工具组件，推理遮挡区域，预测部分可观测下的碰撞风险，并通过约束强化学习训练控制策略生成平滑的避障动作。

Result: 在仿真和真实测试中优于传统方法（APF、MPPI），保持亚毫米级精度，计算成本比最先进的GPU规划器降低约60%，响应时间低于10毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态环境中的机器人操作提供了模块化、高效且有效的碰撞避免解决方案，已成功集成到协作机器人应用中，实现了安全且响应迅速的操作。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human
environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle
motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume
full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly
conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision
avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of
tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system
filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about
occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use
a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce
smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and
real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI)
in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover,
our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to
a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient,
and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments.
We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate
its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在动态物体实时交互抓取合成中无法同时实现低延迟推理和提示性的问题。

Method: 扩展SAMv2模型，集成用户提示与时空上下文信息，实现端到端的实时动态抓取估计。

Result: 在OCID数据集上达到90.6%的实例级抓取准确率，Jacquard上93.8%，GraspNet-1Billion上92.0%，延迟仅73.1ms，比现有方法降低58.5%。真实实验中13个移动物体的交互抓取成功率达94.8%。

Conclusion: SPGrasp有效解决了动态抓取合成中的延迟-交互性权衡问题，实现了实时高性能的交互抓取。

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in
interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively
resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimShear是一个从仿真到现实的触觉控制管道，通过shPix2pix GAN将不含剪切信息的仿真触觉图像转换为包含剪切变形的真实图像，解决了剪切动力学仿真的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪切力在动态物体交互任务中至关重要，但由于剪切动力学的复杂性，在仿真中准确建模剪切信息一直是个挑战。

Method: 提出shPix2pix（剪切条件U-Net GAN），将不含剪切信息的仿真触觉图像与剪切信息编码向量结合，生成包含剪切变形的真实触觉图像。

Result: 该方法在触觉图像仿真和姿态/剪切预测方面优于基准pix2pix方法，在触觉跟踪和协作抬升任务中能将接触误差控制在1-2毫米内。

Conclusion: SimShear验证了使用刚体仿真器进行仿真到现实剪切建模的可行性，为触觉机器人学的仿真开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables
the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in
simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is
critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains
challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a
shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of
shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic
equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix
approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply
SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms
equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where
a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative
co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader
follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1
to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating
the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and
opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

Conclusion: 该框架能够在实时高风险工业环境中有效确保空间精度和视觉保真度，证明了其在工业元宇宙中的实用性

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段框架，结合XCoM/LIPM步态模板与轻量级残差规划器，使双足机器人能够可靠地通过0.2米宽的窄梁


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决双足机器人在窄梁上行走的挑战，包括稀疏的安全关键接触点和纯学习策略的脆弱性

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段在平地上训练跟踪器学习鲁棒跟随步态目标；第二阶段在梁上训练高层规划器预测摆动脚的残差，优化步态模板以实现精确安全的落脚点

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上成功通过0.2米宽、3米长的梁，残差优化方法在成功率、中心线保持和安全裕度方面均优于模板方法和整体基线

Conclusion: 该结构化步态接口实现了透明分析和低摩擦的仿真到现实迁移，为双足机器人窄梁行走提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse,
safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We
propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM
footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level
tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly
follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic
footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable
contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in
simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual
(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template
step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while
preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and
consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,
forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a
Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across
simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms
template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence,
and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent
analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: CoCoL为多机器人系统提供了一种通信高效的协作学习解决方案，能够有效应对数据异构性和通信限制，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of
multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to
high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot
tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized
Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL
achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type
updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming
data, and time-varying network topologies.

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal
with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been
researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called
imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data,
but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and
reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the
framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning
methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change
tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by
conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible
motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The
proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and
skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF
calligraphy robot.

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fabric-based thermal-haptic interface for virtual

fabric with an innovative ultra-lightweight design, achieving only 2~g for each
finger unit. By embedding heating elements within textile pneumatic chambers,
the system delivers modulated pressure and thermal stimuli to fingerpads
through a fully soft, wearable interface.
  Comprehensive characterization demonstrates rapid thermal modulation with
heating rates up to 3$^{\circ}$C/s, enabling dynamic thermal feedback for
virtual or teleoperation interactions. The pneumatic subsystem generates forces
up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance
enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental
validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature
identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and
significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks.
Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved
force control precision (p = 0.013) when haptic feedback is enabled, validating
the effectiveness of the integrated thermal-haptic approach for advanced

Conclusion: PEWM框架利用视频模型的时空视觉先验和VLM的语义感知，弥合细粒度物理交互与高层推理之间的差距，为可扩展、可解释的通用具身智能铺平道路。

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a
start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic
functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve
search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook
available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the
complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed
Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a
wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and
the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better
guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP),
which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate
genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of
data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality
within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses
existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to
R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task. A video

Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy
learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor
parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding
both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates
between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths
and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces
demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution
quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners
in environments ranging from R^8 to R^14 and is successfully validated on a
dual-arm robot manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results

Result: 在Isaac Sim中的综合评估表明，GODHS相比传统非语义搜索策略具有更高的搜索效率

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了语义感知和空间推理，为复杂环境中的物体搜索提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex,
unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from
household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene
representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable
contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in
completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates
semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented
Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large
language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process
through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved
through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each
stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we
introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting
with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.
Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search
efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies. Website

Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant
challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system
reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome
these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with
custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3%
through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel,
daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common
wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based
systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels
across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS,
confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's
efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's
open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that
slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the
robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully
manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a
robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced
whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定位系统假设所有视角同等有效，但实际上观察未映射、模糊或无信息区域会导致定位不可靠，需要主动选择信息丰富的视角

Method: 使用大规模训练的基于注意力的模型，编码度量地图和建图时的相机位姿，预测任意3D位置在不同偏航和俯仰角度的定位精度分布，并将其集成到路径规划器中

Result: 在单视角选择和完整轨迹规划任务上取得了最先进的结果，能够有效泛化到不同的机器人导航和检查任务

Conclusion: ActLoc的模块化设计使其能够广泛应用于各种机器人导航任务，通过主动视角选择显著提升了定位的鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are
incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac,
an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing
through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural
components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities.
Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional
visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing
modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile
feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to
achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate
three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$),
material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material
dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task.
Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to
concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which
verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise
robotic manipulation.

Motivation: 随着机器人在人机环境中的广泛应用，需要确保安全柔和的物理交互。现有阻抗控制方法依赖精确动力学模型，模型失配会导致任务失败和不安全行为

Conclusion: RME提供了一个控制器无关的概率框架，能够快速在线估计动力学失配，实现安全的人机物理交互，无需额外传感器系统

Abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or
other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such
interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow
torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while
accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic
programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on
accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model
mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,
probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,
without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's
proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a
prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the
unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator
driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden
changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in
static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and
dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to
changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory
system.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and
whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid
interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis
exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must
perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both
agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for
humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory
prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based
whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and
timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that
mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive
rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are
incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose
humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and
sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate
real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a
step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then
leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,
bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user

Conclusion: 该框架能够快速适应现实世界中的未知干扰，为机器人控制提供了一种高效的在线适应解决方案。

Abstract: Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and
cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However,
transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the
sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can
degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization
and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle
under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In
this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of
relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly
adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve
this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies
residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a
differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework
refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled
effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics
model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient
backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy
updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of
our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to
unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on
agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the
real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to
L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in
vision-based control without explicit state estimation.

Conclusion: 生成式AI对团队协作有深远影响，管理者需要谨慎选择团队成员，避免因排除低价值员工而引发连锁反应。

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how workers contribute to
shared projects. While workers can use GenAI to boost productivity or reduce
effort, managers may use it to replace some workers entirely. We present a
theoretical framework to analyze how GenAI affects collaboration in such
settings. In our model, the manager selects a team to work on a shared task,
with GenAI substituting for unselected workers. Each worker selects how much
effort to exert, and incurs a cost that increases with the level of effort. We
show that GenAI can lead workers to exert no effort, even if GenAI is almost
ineffective. We further show that the manager's optimization problem is
NP-complete, and provide an efficient algorithm for the special class of
(almost-) linear instances. Our analysis shows that even workers with low
individual value may play a critical role in sustaining overall output, and
excluding such workers can trigger a cascade. Finally, we conduct extensive
simulations to illustrate our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 拼车系统要成功必须提供有吸引力的服务，但由于每个出行者对时间价值的评估不同，运营商难以了解个人的可接受价格水平。

Method: 提出自适应定价策略，运营商每天构建报价，逐步满足出行者期望并吸引增长需求，通过学习个体行为特征来优化个性化票价。

Result: 在10天内对拼车出行者的价格接受水平学习准确率超过90%，既能提高出行者效用，也能增加运营商利润。

Conclusion: 通过学习个体出行者的行为特征，运营商不仅可以改善出行者体验，还能提高自身盈利能力，并专注于有吸引力和盈利性的拼车组合。

Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely
compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a
strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable
price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels
can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in
$10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing
policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively
meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results
suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual
travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility)
but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the
operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and
profitable combinations.

Conclusion: MoTAS在数据有限的实际场景中具有实用价值，为阿尔茨海默病筛查提供了有效的非侵入性解决方案

Abstract: Early screening for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through speech presents a
promising non-invasive approach. However, challenges such as limited data and
the lack of fine-grained, adaptive feature selection often hinder performance.
To address these issues, we propose MoTAS, a robust framework designed to
enhance AD screening efficiency. MoTAS leverages Text-to-Speech (TTS)
augmentation to increase data volume and employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
mechanism to improve multimodal feature selection, jointly enhancing model
generalization. The process begins with automatic speech recognition (ASR) to
obtain accurate transcriptions. TTS is then used to synthesize speech that
enriches the dataset. After extracting acoustic and text embeddings, the MoE
mechanism dynamically selects the most informative features, optimizing feature
fusion for improved classification. Evaluated on the ADReSSo dataset, MoTAS
achieves a leading accuracy of 85.71\%, outperforming existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of TTS
augmentation and MoE in boosting classification performance. These findings
highlight the practical value of MoTAS in real-world AD screening scenarios,
particularly in data-limited settings.

Motivation: 当前基于流的生成式语音增强方法学习曲线概率路径，但其影响未知。机器学习研究表明直线路径更易训练且泛化能力更好，因此需要量化路径直线性对语音增强质量的影响。

Conclusion: 直线的时间独立概率路径比曲线的时间依赖路径能更好地改善生成式语音增强性能。

Abstract: Current flow-based generative speech enhancement methods learn curved
probability paths which model a mapping between clean and noisy speech. Despite
impressive performance, the implications of curved probability paths are
unknown. Methods such as Schrodinger bridges focus on curved paths, where
time-dependent gradients and variance do not promote straight paths. Findings
in machine learning research suggest that straight paths, such as conditional
flow matching, are easier to train and offer better generalisation. In this
paper we quantify the effect of path straightness on speech enhancement
quality. We report experiments with the Schrodinger bridge, where we show that
certain configurations lead to straighter paths. Conversely, we propose
independent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, which models
straight paths between noisy and clean speech. We demonstrate empirically that
a time-independent variance has a greater effect on sample quality than the
gradient. Although conditional flow matching improves several speech quality
metrics, it requires multiple inference steps. We rectify this with a one-step
solution by inferring the trained flow-based model as if it was directly
predictive. Our work suggests that straighter time-independent probability
paths improve generative speech enhancement over curved time-dependent paths.

Motivation: 现有符号音乐生成模型假设音符属性存在固定的单向时间依赖关系，但研究发现不同属性作为初始token都能获得相近性能，表明音符属性本质上是并发无序的集合而非时序依赖序列。

Method: 提出Amadeus框架：1）自回归模型处理音符序列；2）双向离散扩散模型处理属性；3）MLSDES策略增强音乐表示判别性；4）CIEM模块通过注意力机制强化音符潜在表示。

Result: 在无条件和文本条件生成任务中，Amadeus在多个指标上显著超越SOTA模型，同时实现至少4倍加速，并展示了无需训练即可进行细粒度音符属性控制的可行性。

Conclusion: Amadeus框架通过重新思考音符属性的本质关系，结合创新的双层架构和增强策略，为符号音乐生成提供了新的性能基准，同时构建了最大的开源符号音乐数据集AMD来支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly
adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling
symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal
dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure
among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as
the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This
suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent
and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this
insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework.
Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note
sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To
enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement
Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify
discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional
Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent
vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note
decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and
text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA
models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up.
Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control
feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the
Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset
to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and
fine-tuning.

*Ran Piao,Yuan Lu,Hareld Kemps,Tong Xia,Aaqib Saeed*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MARVEL是一个多任务学习框架，使用声学特征同时检测9种神经、呼吸和声音疾病，无需原始音频传输，在Bridge2AI-Voice数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音健康评估方法通常只关注单一病症，未能充分利用语音中丰富的多维度信息，需要开发能够同时检测多种疾病的隐私保护型框架。

Method: 采用双分支架构，包含专用编码器和任务特定头部，共享共同的声学骨干网络，实现跨病症知识迁移，仅使用派生声学特征避免原始音频传输。

Result: 整体AUROC达到0.78，神经疾病检测表现突出（AUROC=0.89），阿尔茨海默病/轻度认知障碍检测达到AUROC=0.97，在9项任务中的7项超越最先进的自监督模型。

Conclusion: 该研究证明单一统一模型可有效筛查多种疾病，为资源受限和远程医疗环境中的语音诊断部署奠定了基础，学习到的表征与临床认可的声学模式具有一致性。

Abstract: Voice-based health assessment offers unprecedented opportunities for
scalable, non-invasive disease screening, yet existing approaches typically
focus on single conditions and fail to leverage the rich, multi-faceted
information embedded in speech. We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic
Representations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask
learning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological,
respiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features,
eliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture
employs specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic
backbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on
the large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC
of 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89),
particularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97).
Our framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and
surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while
correlation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit
meaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the
model's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized
acoustic patterns. By demonstrating that a single unified model can effectively
screen for diverse conditions, this work establishes a foundation for
deployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained and remote
healthcare settings.

*ChenYi Chua,JunKai Wong,Chengxin Chen,Xiaoxiao Miao*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于熵感知分数选择的多模态语音情感识别框架，结合语音和文本预测，通过后期分数融合和情感映射策略提升识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态语音情感识别系统存在置信度限制，需要利用多模态信息（语音和文本）来提升识别准确性和可靠性

Method: 使用wav2vec2.0作为声学模型和RoBERTa-XLM进行情感分析，通过Whisper-large-v3生成转录文本，采用基于熵和方差熵阈值的后期分数融合方法，以及三情感类别到四情感类别的映射策略

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MSP-IMPROV数据集上验证，该方法相比传统单模态系统提供了实用且可靠的性能提升

Conclusion: 所提出的多模态框架通过熵感知分数选择和情感映射，有效克服了单模态预测的置信度限制，为语音情感识别提供了增强解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework for speech emotion
recognition that leverages entropy-aware score selection to combine speech and
textual predictions. The proposed method integrates a primary pipeline that
consists of an acoustic model based on wav2vec2.0 and a secondary pipeline that
consists of a sentiment analysis model using RoBERTa-XLM, with transcriptions
generated via Whisper-large-v3. We propose a late score fusion approach based
on entropy and varentropy thresholds to overcome the confidence constraints of
primary pipeline predictions. A sentiment mapping strategy translates three
sentiment categories into four target emotion classes, enabling coherent
integration of multimodal predictions. The results on the IEMOCAP and
MSP-IMPROV datasets show that the proposed method offers a practical and
reliable enhancement over traditional single-modality systems.

*Huong Ngo,Matt Deitke,Martijn Bartelds,Sarah Pratt,Josh Gardner,Matt Jordan,Ludwig Schmidt*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了OLMoASR-Pool大规模数据集和OLMoASR系列模型，通过数据质量筛选方法构建了100万小时高质量音频-文本对数据集OLMoASR-Mix，训练出的模型在零样本语音识别任务上达到与Whisper相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然训练数据规模和质量的改进带来了显著进展，但在语音识别领域的影响仍未充分探索。需要研究如何通过数据筛选和模型训练来开发鲁棒的零样本语音识别模型。

Method: 从300万小时英语音频和1700万转录文本的OLMoASR-Pool数据集开始，设计文本启发式过滤器去除低质量或错误转录数据，构建了100万小时高质量音频-文本对数据集OLMoASR-Mix，并训练了参数量从3900万到15亿的OLMoASR系列模型。

Result: 在所有模型规模上，OLMoASR在短语音和长语音识别基准测试中达到了与OpenAI Whisper相当的平均性能。OLMoASR-medium.en在短语音和长语音识别上分别达到12.8%和11.0%的词错误率，与同等参数量的Whisper-medium.en的12.4%和10.5%相当。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的数据筛选流程可以构建高质量语音识别数据集，训练出的模型在零样本语音识别任务上表现优异。研究团队将公开数据集、模型以及过滤、训练和评估代码，以促进鲁棒语音处理研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant
advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In
this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of
models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition
models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio
and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or
mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M
hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use
OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M
(tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR
achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and
long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a
12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest
English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and
long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count).
OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will
be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

### [247] [SincQDR-VAD: A Noise-Robust Voice Activity Detection Framework Leveraging Learnable Filters and Ranking-Aware Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20885)
*Chien-Chun Wang,En-Lun Yu,Jeih-Weih Hung,Shih-Chieh Huang,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SincQDR-VAD是一个紧凑且鲁棒的语音活动检测框架，结合Sinc提取器前端和新型二次差异排序损失，在噪声环境中显著提升性能同时减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAD方法在噪声环境中缺乏鲁棒性，且帧级分类损失与VAD评估指标关联不紧密，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用Sinc提取器前端（可学习带通滤波器）捕获抗噪声频谱特征，结合二次差异排序损失优化语音和非语音帧的成对得分顺序。

Result: 在代表性基准数据集上实验显示，AUROC和F2-Score显著提升，参数使用量比现有方法减少31%（仅使用69%参数）。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持高效率的同时显著提升了VAD性能，证实了其在噪声和资源受限环境中的实用可行性。

Abstract: Voice activity detection (VAD) is essential for speech-driven applications,
but remains far from perfect in noisy and resource-limited environments.
Existing methods often lack robustness to noise, and their frame-wise
classification losses are only loosely coupled with the evaluation metric of
VAD. To address these challenges, we propose SincQDR-VAD, a compact and robust
framework that combines a Sinc-extractor front-end with a novel quadratic
disparity ranking loss. The Sinc-extractor uses learnable bandpass filters to
capture noise-resistant spectral features, while the ranking loss optimizes the
pairwise score order between speech and non-speech frames to improve the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). A series of
experiments conducted on representative benchmark datasets show that our
framework considerably improves both AUROC and F2-Score, while using only 69%
of the parameters compared to prior arts, confirming its efficiency and
practical viability.

### [248] [Learning Robust Spatial Representations from Binaural Audio through Feature Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20914)
*Holger Severin Bovbjerg,Jan Østergaard,Jesper Jensen,Shinji Watanabe,Zheng-Hua Tan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于特征蒸馏的预训练方法，用于从双耳语音中学习鲁棒的空间表示，无需数据标签，并在DoA估计任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度表示学习在音频任务中表现优异，但多声道音频的空间表示学习研究不足。需要探索无标签数据下的空间特征学习方法。

Method: 使用特征蒸馏预训练框架：从干净双耳语音计算空间特征作为预测标签，通过神经网络从增强语音预测这些特征，预训练后使用编码器权重初始化DoA估计模型并进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，经过微调的预训练模型在噪声和混响环境中的方向估计性能优于全监督模型和传统信号处理方法。

Conclusion: 基于特征蒸馏的无监督预训练方法能够有效学习空间表示，提升DoA估计在复杂声学环境中的性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep representation learning has shown strong performance in
multiple audio tasks. However, its use for learning spatial representations
from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a
pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial
representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this
framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to
form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from
corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we
throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to
initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our
experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in
noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival
estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal
processing methods.

### [249] [WoW-Bench: Evaluating Fine-Grained Acoustic Perception in Audio-Language Models via Marine Mammal Vocalizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20976)
*Jaeyeon Kim,Heeseung Yun,Sang Hoon Woo,Chao-Han Huck Yang,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了WoW-Bench基准测试，用于评估大型音频语言模型在低频听觉感知和认知方面的能力，特别是在海洋哺乳动物声音识别任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型音频语言模型在低频听觉（如音高和时长检测）方面的能力尚未充分探索，而这对处理现实世界中分布外任务至关重要，模型需要基于细粒度声学线索推理不熟悉的声音。

Method: 引入World-of-Whale基准测试（WoW-Bench），包含感知基准（分类新声音）和认知基准（基于Bloom分类法评估记忆、理解、应用和分析声音事件的能力），并引入干扰问题来确保模型真正通过听觉解决问题。

Result: 实验表明，最先进的大型音频语言模型在此基准上的表现远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 大型音频语言模型需要更强的听觉基础能力，当前模型在低频听觉感知和认知方面存在明显不足。

Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) extend language understanding into the
auditory domain, yet their ability to perform low-level listening, such as
pitch and duration detection, remains underexplored. However, low-level
listening is critical for real-world, out-of-distribution tasks where models
must reason about unfamiliar sounds based on fine-grained acoustic cues. To
address this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to
evaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal
vocalizations. WoW-bench is composed of a Perception benchmark for categorizing
novel sounds and a Cognition benchmark, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to assess
the abilities to remember, understand, apply, and analyze sound events. For the
Cognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate
whether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying
on other heuristics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs show performance
far below human levels, indicating a need for stronger auditory grounding in
LALMs.

*Jazbo Beason,Ruijia Cheng,Eldon Schoop,Jeffrey Nichols*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Athena是一个原型应用生成环境，使用共享中间表示（应用故事板、数据模型和GUI骨架）来帮助开发者与LLM迭代式地构建完整用户界面，解决了LLM生成复杂UI代码的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型难以生成完整的用户界面代码，因为UI复杂且通常由多个相互关联的文件组成。单一提示往往无法包含足够细节，且生成结果通常是单一庞大难以理解的文件。

Method: 引入Athena原型系统，使用共享中间表示（应用故事board、数据模型和GUI骨架）来搭建LLM的代码生成过程，支持开发者与LLM进行迭代式协作，生成组织良好、结构化的多文件代码。

Result: 用户研究显示75%的参与者更喜欢Athena原型系统，相比传统的聊天机器人式基线方法在应用原型开发方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 使用中间表示可以有效地搭建LLM的代码生成过程，产生组织良好的结构化代码，同时限制错误，显著改善了使用LLM生成完整用户界面的体验。

Abstract: It is challenging to generate the code for a complete user interface using a
Large Language Model (LLM). User interfaces are complex and their
implementations often consist of multiple, inter-related files that together
specify the contents of each screen, the navigation flows between the screens,
and the data model used throughout the application. It is challenging to craft
a single prompt for an LLM that contains enough detail to generate a complete
user interface, and even then the result is frequently a single large and
difficult to understand file that contains all of the generated screens. In
this paper, we introduce Athena, a prototype application generation environment
that demonstrates how the use of shared intermediate representations, including
an app storyboard, data model, and GUI skeletons, can help a developer work
with an LLM in an iterative fashion to craft a complete user interface. These
intermediate representations also scaffold the LLM's code generation process,
producing organized and structured code in multiple files while limiting
errors. We evaluated Athena with a user study that found 75% of participants
preferred our prototype over a typical chatbot-style baseline for prototyping
apps.

### [251] [Identifying Framing Practices in Visualization Design Through Practitioner Reflections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20383)
*Prakash Shukla,Paul Parsons*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析可视化设计师的访谈内容，探讨了框架化在设计过程中的核心作用，发现框架化是一个贯穿问题界定、数据解释、利益相关者协调和叙事构建的迭代活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化研究中框架化主要从修辞和感知效果角度被研究，但其在设计过程中的作用未被充分探索，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 分析80多位专业可视化设计师在公开播客和书籍章节中对其工作的反思内容。

Result: 发现框架化是一个普遍存在的迭代活动，体现在问题界定、数据解释、利益相关者目标协调和叙事方向塑造中，识别了触发重新框架化的条件和实践者使用的策略。

Conclusion: 框架化是可视化实践的核心维度，研究和教育需要支持实践者在整个设计过程中运用的解释性和战略性判断。

Abstract: Framing -- how designers define and reinterpret problems, shape narratives,
and guide audience understanding -- is central to design practice. Yet in
visualization research, framing has been examined mostly through its rhetorical
and perceptual effects on audiences, leaving its role in the design process
underexplored. This study addresses that gap by analyzing publicly available
podcasts and book chapters in which over 80 professional visualization
designers reflect on their work. We find that framing is a pervasive, iterative
activity, evident in scoping problems, interpreting data, aligning with
stakeholder goals, and shaping narrative direction. Our analysis identifies the
conditions that trigger reframing and the strategies practitioners use to
navigate uncertainty and guide design. These findings position framing as a
core dimension of visualization practice and underscore the need for research
and education to support the interpretive and strategic judgment that
practitioners exercise throughout the design process.

TL;DR: 本研究扩展计划行为理论，加入安全、信任、兼容性和理解四个外部因素，分析行人在L5自动驾驶车辆前的过街决策。调查显示行为控制、态度和社会信息显著预测过街意图，安全感和理解力是关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路交通事故是全球主要死因之一，其中超过一半的死亡是行人和弱势道路使用者。L5级自动驾驶系统有潜力减少事故，但需要有效与行人沟通意图，在缺乏传统驾驶员提示的情况下安全协调。理解行人如何解读和响应自动驾驶行为对联网车辆系统发展至关重要。

Method: 扩展计划行为理论(TPB)，加入四个外部因素（安全、信任、兼容性、理解），通过在线调查(n=212)收集数据，建模行人在L5自动驾驶车辆前的过街决策过程。

Result: 感知行为控制、态度和社会信息显著预测行人过街意图。外部因素中，特别是感知安全性和理解力对这些构念有强烈影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计外部人机界面(eHMIs)和协同V2X通信策略提供了可操作的见解，支持自动驾驶车辆与行人之间的安全透明交互，有助于发展包容性、以人为本的联网移动系统。

Abstract: Road traffic remains a leading cause of death worldwide, with pedestrians and
other vulnerable road users accounting for over half of the 1.19 million annual
fatalities, much of it due to human error. Level-5 automated driving systems
(ADSs), capable of full self-driving without human oversight, have the
potential to reduce these incidents. However, their effectiveness depends not
only on automation performance but also on their ability to communicate intent
and coordinate safely with pedestrians in the absence of traditional driver
cues. Understanding how pedestrians interpret and respond to ADS behavior is
therefore critical to the development of connected vehicle systems. This study
extends the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by incorporating four external
factors (i.e. safety, trust, compatibility, and understanding) to model
pedestrian decision-making in road-crossing scenarios involving level-5 ADSs.
Using data from an online survey (n = 212), results show that perceived
behavioral control, attitude, and social information significantly predict
pedestrians' crossing intentions. External factors, particularly perceived
safety and understanding, strongly influence these constructs. Findings provide
actionable insights for designing external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) and
cooperative V2X communication strategies that support safe, transparent
interactions between automated vehicles and pedestrians. This work contributes
to the development of inclusive, human-centered connected mobility systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间计算领域存在概念分裂，不同学科有着异质的理解，这阻碍了该领域的整体理解和跨学科整合。

Method: 追溯空间计算的起源和历史演变，分析了对"空间"的两种理解学派：一种将空间视为上下文理解，另一种将空间视为混合交互环境。

Result: 通过综合两种观点，提出了空间计算作为一种计算范式的新定义，重新定义了环境、计算和人类体验之间的互动关系。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个更有概括性的视角来增强空间计算的概念清晰度，并为支持与环境进行有意义交互的未来技术创新提供了灵感。

Abstract: Recent advancements in geographic information systems and mixed reality
technologies have positioned spatial computing as a transformative paradigm in
computational science. However, the field remains conceptually fragmented, with
diverse interpretations across disciplines like Human-Computer Interaction,
Geographic Information Science, and Computer Science, which hinders a
comprehensive understanding of spatial computing and poses challenges for its
coherent advancement and interdisciplinary integration. In this paper, we trace
the origins and historical evolution of spatial computing and examine how
"spatial" is understood, identifying two schools of thought: "spatial" as the
contextual understanding of space, where spatial data guides interaction in the
physical world; and "spatial" as a mixed space for interaction, emphasizing the
seamless integration of physical and digital environments to enable embodied
engagement. By synthesizing these perspectives, we propose spatial computing as
a computational paradigm that redefines the interplay between environment,
computation, and human experience, offering a holistic lens to enhance its
conceptual clarity and inspire future technological innovations that support
meaningful interactions with and shaping of environments.

Conclusion: 提出的综合分析工具能够更好地理解复杂视觉搜索任务中的认知过程和决策机制，为眼动数据分析提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Eye Tracking (ET) can help to understand visual attention and cognitive
processes in interactive environments. In attention tasks, distinguishing
between relevant target objects and distractors is crucial for effective
performance, yet the underlying gaze patterns that drive successful task
completion remain incompletely understood. Traditional gaze analyses lack
comprehensive insights into the temporal dynamics of attention allocation and
the relationship between gaze behavior and task performance. When applied to
complex visual search scenarios, current gaze analysis methods face several
limitations, including the isolation of measurements, visual stability, search
efficiency, and the decision-making processes involved in these scenarios. This
paper proposes an analysis tool that considers time series for eye tracking
data from task performance and also gaze measures (fixations, saccades and
smooth pursuit); temporal pattern analysis that reveals how attention evolves
throughout task performance; object-click sequence tracking that directly links
visual attention to user actions; and performance metrics that quantify both
accuracy and efficiency. This tool provides comprehensive visualization
techniques that make complex patterns of stimuli and gaze connections
interpretable.

Motivation: 传统反思性日记缺乏个性化，无法吸引偏好视觉沉浸和快节奏交互的Gen Alpha和Z代人群，需要开发更符合数字原生代需求的日记方式

Method: 采用个性化引导流程收集用户人口统计和风格偏好，使用检索增强生成(RAG)框架优先处理情感重要记忆，通过文本到图像模型动态生成视觉叙事内容

Result: 系统能够创建与用户身份共鸣的个性化输出，提供有意义的情境丰富交互，并将用户经历转化为视觉吸引人的叙事

Conclusion: Persode通过解决个性化、视觉参与和响应性需求，成功弥合了传统日记与新生代偏好之间的差距

Abstract: Reflective journaling often lacks personalization and fails to engage
Generation Alpha and Z, who prefer visually immersive and fast-paced
interactions over traditional text-heavy methods. Visual storytelling enhances
emotional recall and offers an engaging way to process personal expe- riences.
Designed with these digital-native generations in mind, this paper introduces
Persode, a journaling system that integrates personalized onboarding,
memory-aware conversational agents, and automated visual storytelling. Persode
captures user demographics and stylistic preferences through a tailored
onboarding process, ensuring outputs resonate with individual identities. Using
a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, it prioritizes emotionally
significant memories to provide meaningful, context-rich interactions.
Additionally, Persode dynamically transforms user experiences into visually
engaging narratives by generating prompts for advanced text-to-image models,
adapting characters, backgrounds, and styles to user preferences. By addressing
the need for personalization, visual engagement, and responsiveness, Persode
bridges the gap between traditional journaling and the evolving preferences of
Gen Alpha and Z.

Conclusion: 研究结果启发了未来LLM聊天界面的设计方向：改进目标沟通、减少认知负荷、增强交互性，并通过反馈提升LLM性能。

Abstract: As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and
more complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their
conversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users
better manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal
alignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results
with examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to
navigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20
participants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat
interface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and
effort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to
overcome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can
enhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired
design implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal
communication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable
feedback to improve LLM performance.
