### [1] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用频域分析和深度学习检测StyleGAN生成的图像，通过2D傅里叶变换和ResNet50网络在频域中识别GAN图像的周期性伪影，准确率达92.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成对抗网络(GANs)产生的逼真图像对图像取证和需要可靠内容真实性的工业系统构成严重挑战，需要有效区分真实图像和GAN生成图像的方法。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换(2D DFT)将图像转换到频域，然后使用ResNet50神经网络在频域图像上训练分类模型，检测GAN图像的周期性伪影特征。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征或"指纹"，结合信号处理技术和深度学习的方法在数字取证和增强工业AI系统可信度方面具有工业潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [2] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，通过中间梯度敏感性分数解决3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外视角下的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当从训练数据分布之外的视角观察3D高斯泼溅模型时，常出现严重的视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏这些外推区域的训练数据导致的密度、颜色和几何预测不确定性。

Method: 利用中间梯度推导的敏感性分数，专门针对各向异性方向引起的不稳定性而非各向同性方差进行过滤，直接处理生成不确定性的核心问题。

Result: 实验评估表明，相比现有的基于神经辐射场的方法如BayesRays，该方法显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性。

Conclusion: 该过滤器能够实时无缝集成到现有的3DGS渲染管道中，无需进行大量的事后重新训练或微调。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [3] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了将Vision Transformers与对比学习目标相结合进行3D形状特征表示学习，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%的准确率，克服了传统CNN在捕捉形状关系和需要大量标注数据方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体方面存在困难，通常需要大量标注数据，且CNN可能忽略关键的形状关系。

Method: 采用Vision Transformers架构与现代对比学习目标相结合，包括监督对比学习和自监督对比学习，进行多视角3D分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，监督对比损失达到约90.6%的准确率，证明了ViT与对比学习结合的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT能够捕捉全局形状语义，对比学习优化能够细化局部判别特征，这种结合方法为3D表示学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [4] [From Far and Near: Perceptual Evaluation of Crowd Representations Across Levels of Detail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20558)
*Xiaohan Sun,Carol O'Sullivan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究用户对不同细节层次和观看距离下人群角色视觉质量的感知，比较几何网格、图像代理、NeRF和3D高斯等表示方法的视觉保真度与计算性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同人群表示方法在视觉质量和计算性能之间的平衡，为设计感知优化的细节层次策略提供指导。

Method: 使用定性分析和定量评估方法，比较几何网格、图像代理、NeRF和3D高斯等四种人群表示技术在不同细节层次和观看距离下的表现。

Result: 每种表示方法在视觉保真度和计算性能方面都有不同的权衡特性，研究结果为人群渲染的感知优化提供了具体见解。

Conclusion: 研究为设计感知优化的细节层次策略提供了重要指导，帮助在人群渲染中平衡视觉质量和计算效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how users perceive the visual quality of crowd
character representations at different levels of detail (LoD) and viewing
distances. Each representation: geometric meshes, image-based impostors, Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and 3D Gaussians, exhibits distinct trade-offs between
visual fidelity and computational performance. Our qualitative and quantitative
results provide insights to guide the design of perceptually optimized LoD
strategies for crowd rendering.

### [5] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个模块化的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过引入基于transformer的平滑器和融合驱动的跟踪器，在现有3D检测器基础上构建。该框架在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上表现出色，aMOTA达到74.7，显著减少了身份切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受基于查询的跟踪框架启发，旨在通过多模态传感器特征提升transformer跟踪方法的性能，解决遮挡和视角变化下的鲁棒重识别问题。

Method: 采用多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流水线，集成边界框与多相机和LiDAR的BEV融合特征，无需显式运动模型。包含时间平滑器来优化轨迹，减少抖动。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上aMOTA达到74.7，在3D MOT基准测试中表现强劲，显著减少身份切换同时保持竞争性精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为改进基于transformer的跟踪器提供了高效框架，即使数据有限且无需预训练，也能与其他基于神经网络的方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [6] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑(OLS)通过动态调整软标签来改善医学图像分类中的过度自信问题，在RadImageNet数据集上相比传统方法提升了Top-1和Top-5准确率，并产生更紧凑的特征嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，影响医疗应用的可信度。传统标签平滑方法将所有非目标类别同等对待，忽略了类别间的关系。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑(OLS)方法，在训练过程中基于模型自身的预测模式动态调整软标签。在RadImageNet数据集上评估了ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS相比硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏等方法，持续提升了Top-1和Top-5分类准确率，并产生了更紧凑和分离度更好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅增强了预测性能，还改善了校准效果，为医学影像领域开发可信AI系统提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对鱼眼相机交通监控的检测框架，通过预处理和后处理管道增强检测一致性，结合多种先进检测模型的集成策略，在AI City Challenge Track 4中获得第8名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机在广域交通监控中具有优势，但其强径向失真和非均匀分辨率给标准目标检测器带来挑战，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化。

Method: 采用简单有效的预处理和后处理管道，训练多种先进检测模型并通过集成策略结合它们的输出。

Result: 在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4中获得了0.6366的F1分数，在62支队伍中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的问题，证明了在强失真条件下检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [8] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle是一个混合两阶段框架，结合物理建模和机器学习，通过逆向时间迁移和基于transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器，在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下实现准确的脑部声速图重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于物理的全波形反演方法受限于颅骨引起的信号衰减、模式转换和相位畸变，而纯数据驱动方法在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下会产生定量偏差的声速图。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用逆向时间迁移从多角度采集生成迁移片段；第二阶段使用基于transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器融合片段。采用可移动低计数换能器的部分阵列采集策略。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验显示，BrainPuzzle实现了优越的声速重建精度和图像完整性。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle展示了推进定量超声脑成像的潜力，通过混合算法补偿缺失孔径，在临床不切实际的条件下实现准确重建。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [9] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个统一评估框架，用于诊断文本到图像(T2I)生成和图像到图像(I2I)编辑中的文化偏见，发现模型倾向于默认使用全球北方、现代风格的描绘，I2I编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，且当前系统无法进行可靠的文化敏感编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像编辑器的文化偏见研究不足，需要建立一个标准化的评估协议来比较诊断这两种系统的文化偏差。

Method: 使用开放模型和固定设置，在六个国家进行跨国家、跨时代、跨类别评估，结合标准自动指标、文化感知的检索增强VQA和来自本地评审专家的专业人工判断。

Result: 研究发现：(1)在国家无关提示下，模型默认采用全球北方、现代倾向的描绘，削弱了跨国家差异；(2)迭代I2I编辑会侵蚀文化保真度；(3)I2I模型仅应用表面线索而非时代一致、上下文感知的变化。

Conclusion: 当前系统中的文化敏感编辑仍然不可靠，通过发布标准化数据、提示和人工评估协议，为诊断和跟踪生成图像模型中的文化偏见提供了一个可复现、以文化为中心的基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [10] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FIBAR方法，使用IIR滤波器异步重建事件相机图像，无需GPU，在CPU上高效运行，适合标记检测等任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的事件相机图像重建方法需要GPU且复杂，需要更简单高效的异步重建方法

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件强度变化，通过新颖算法检测陈旧像素并用高斯滤波器模糊处理

Result: 在笔记本电脑CPU上达到42-140百万事件/秒的处理速度，重建图像比神经网络方法有噪声但足以完成标记检测任务

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单高效的异步图像重建方法，虽然存在噪声和重影问题，但适用于某些实际应用场景

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的变换双边张量低秩表示模型TBTLRR，通过数据自适应的张量核范数和双边结构来提升图像聚类的鲁棒性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换，对噪声鲁棒性差，需要更有效捕捉全局和局部相关性的方法。

Method: 引入数据自适应的张量核范数学习任意酉变换，利用双边结构捕捉局部相关性，集成ℓ₁/₂范数和Frobenius范数正则化处理复杂噪声，基于ADMM开发优化算法。

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法在聚类任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TBTLRR模型通过自适应变换和双边结构有效提升了张量低秩表示在图像聚类中的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源的跨平台应用程序，用于标准化和匿名化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式异构性和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和外科数据科学可以推进外科培训、研究和质量改进，但由于记录格式异构和视频共享的隐私问题，广泛使用受到限制。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期，基于用户反馈迭代开发。分析阶段通过内部调查确定关键需求，采用隐私设计架构。测试阶段结合可用性启发式和TAM模型评估可用性和采纳度。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性评分（4.68/5和4.03/5），改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）、启发式可用性（4.38/5）和强烈推荐（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了一个透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程。需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证来确立其作为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了注意力卷积（ATConv），通过将自注意力的两个关键特性——自适应路由和侧向抑制——注入到卷积操作中，解决了自注意力二次复杂度的问题，同时保持了其表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力在视觉骨干网络中表现出强大的表达能力，但其二次复杂度限制了实际应用。卷积具有线性复杂度，但性能存在差距。本文旨在探索自注意力优于卷积的根本原则，并设计出兼具两者优点的解决方案。

Method: 提出了注意力卷积（ATConv），通过重新设计卷积算子，引入自适应路由（根据语义内容动态调节位置信息流）和侧向抑制（通过token权重竞争抑制冗余、锐化表示）两个关键机制。

Result: 仅使用3×3核的ATConv在基础视觉任务中持续优于各种自注意力机制。基于ATConv构建的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%的Top-1准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散图像生成中，用ATConv替换SiT-XL/2中的所有自注意力，在400k步内将ImageNet FID降低0.15，且采样更快。

Conclusion: ATConv成功地将自注意力的核心优势融入卷积框架，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了超越自注意力的性能，为构建高效视觉骨干网络提供了新方向。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签的价值，能够有效桥接生物图像与多模态基础模型，为生物多模态学习提供了新的监督范式。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

TL;DR: 提出了LogitGap方法，通过利用最大logit与其余logit之间的关系来增强ID和OOD样本的可分性，在多种OOD检测场景中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后处理方法往往未充分利用模型logit空间中丰富的信息，需要更有效地利用logit关系来提升OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，利用最大logit与其余logit的差距来检测OOD样本，并引入无训练策略自动识别最信息丰富的logit子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在多种OOD检测场景和基准测试中一致达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logit空间关系，提供了一种高效且易于部署的OOD检测解决方案，在理论和实证上都证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集如PartNet依赖无纹理几何和专家标注，限制了可扩展性和实用性，需要更高质量的数据集来促进计算机视觉、图形学和机器人学的发展。

Method: 构建大规模纹理3D模型数据集，采用可扩展的标注方法，包含细粒度层次化部件标签，并在类无关部件分割和3D部件中心问答两个任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 在类无关部件分割任务中，现有方法在细粒度和叶级部件上表现不佳；在3D部件问答任务中，3D-LLMs在开放词汇部件定位方面存在显著差距；使用PartNeXt训练的Point-SAM相比PartNet有显著提升。

Conclusion: PartNeXt通过可扩展标注、纹理感知标签和多任务评估，为结构化3D理解研究开辟了新途径，展示了数据集在质量和多样性方面的优势。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，骑行者属于安全关键类别的易受伤害道路使用者，准确估计其姿态对于交叉意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统6D姿态估计方法无法处理自行车铰接部件的变化，因为车把和踏板的角度变化会影响3D边界框和实际行驶方向。

Method: 提出联合估计铰接式自行车的8D姿态和3D关键点的方法，使用合成和真实图像数据的混合进行训练，以在真实图像上实现泛化。8D姿态包括3D平移、旋转以及车把和踏板的旋转角度。

Result: 该方法在8D姿态参数估计精度方面表现出有前景的结果，与使用刚性规范对象模板匹配的最先进类别级6D姿态估计器相比，取得了竞争性分数。

Conclusion: 所提出的8D姿态估计方法能够更精细地估计自行车姿态状态和行驶方向，为自动驾驶中的骑行者安全提供了更准确的姿态信息。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Conclusion: TOMCAT方法通过有效利用多模态知识和自适应原型更新机制，成功解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

Motivation: 利用信息瓶颈框架优化GAN，改进InfoGAN的架构，通过在生成器中间层引入随机层来约束互信息，实现更好的解耦表征学习。

Method: 在GAN生成器中引入中间随机层，将其作为可学习的潜在分布，与生成器联合端到端训练，约束输入与生成输出之间的互信息。

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAE竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID得分上优于β-VAE和InfoGAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架成功实现了GAN的解耦表征学习，在解耦性能和生成质量方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA

Motivation: 解决立体视频深度估计中的时间一致性问题，传统方法在建模长期时间依赖时面临计算成本与性能的权衡困境。

Method: 提出Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM)模块，包含'pick'过程选择最相关帧和'play'过程自适应加权选择帧进行时空聚合，维护紧凑且信息丰富的记忆缓冲区。

Result: 在Sintel数据集上取得了0.62/1.11 TEPE的优异性能（相比BiDAStereo提升17.3%和9.02%），且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程有效实现了高效的长距离时空一致性建模，在精度和时间一致性方面均达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Motivation: 脑MRI基础模型的发展严重依赖于数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但目前缺乏对这些因素的系统评估。

Method: 在数据集层面分析模态组成、疾病覆盖和规模；在图像层面量化体素间距、方向和强度分布；评估预处理变异性对体素统计和几何的影响；使用3D DenseNet121进行特征空间案例研究。

Result: 发现健康队列与临床人群之间存在严重不平衡，预处理步骤提高了数据集内一致性但无法完全消除数据集间差异，标准化预处理后仍存在可测量的残差协变量偏移。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

TL;DR: RAPO++是一个跨阶段的提示优化框架，通过检索增强提示优化、样本特定提示优化和LLM微调，显著提升文本到视频生成质量，无需修改底层生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户提供的提示通常简短、非结构化且与训练数据不匹配，限制了基于扩散的文本到视频模型的生成潜力。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) RAPO阶段通过检索相关修饰符重构提示以匹配训练分布；2) SSPO阶段使用多源反馈迭代优化提示；3) 使用优化后的提示对微调LLM。

Result: 在五个最先进的T2V模型和五个基准测试中，RAPO++在语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性方面取得显著提升，大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPO++是一个模型无关、成本高效且可扩展的解决方案，为T2V生成中的提示优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

*Yanghao Wang,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCycle是一个基于流的免反演图像编辑框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化图像损坏过程，并使用循环一致性优化来生成目标感知的中间状态，从而在保持源图像一致性的同时实现忠实修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像编辑方法采用目标无关的中间状态构建方式，主要关注源图像重建而忽视了与特定编辑目标的语义差距，导致在需要大幅修改时编辑能力有限或不一致。

Method: 提出FlowCycle框架，通过可学习噪声参数化图像损坏，利用循环一致性过程进行优化，通过从源到目标再回到源的双重一致性约束迭代编辑，学习生成目标感知的中间状态。

Result: 广泛的消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态构建，能够在保持源图像一致性的同时实现更忠实的修改，解决了现有方法在语义差距较大时编辑能力有限的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统胎儿运动检测方法（如母体感知和胎心监护）存在主观性强和准确性有限的问题，异常运动模式可能预示胎盘功能障碍或胎儿窘迫等并发症。

Method: 采用双对比损失的自监督学习框架，结合空间和时间对比学习来学习鲁棒的运动表示，并引入任务特定采样策略和概率微调方法。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有潜力，为改善产前监测和临床决策铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: EditInfinity 通过利用 VQ 生成模型的精确中间表示特性，有效解决了图像反演中的近似误差问题，实现了更精确的图像编辑。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出一个"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来解决大视觉语言模型在长回答中的幻觉问题，认为幻觉风险源于对上下文依赖的增加而非长度本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在长回答中更容易产生幻觉，传统观点认为是长度导致的错误累积，但作者质疑是否存在更深层机制。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"框架：通过设计特定上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，在实际解码时抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 在所有基准测试中都取得了持续显著的改进，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 幻觉风险主要源于长回答中对上下文依赖的增加，而非长度本身。该研究为深入探索LVLMs长回答中的幻觉问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,
model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于高斯溅射的开放词汇3D分割方法要么依赖单一3D语言场导致分割效果不佳，要么依赖预计算的类无关分割导致错误累积。

Method: 提出协作场概念（实例场+语言场），通过实例到语言特征映射和两阶段训练策略构建协作场，在推理时采用自适应语言到实例提示精化。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中表现出领先性能，并在新图像3D分割、分层分割和机器人应用方面显示出高潜力。

Conclusion: COS3D通过有效整合语言和分割线索，实现了高质量的开放词汇3D分割，代码已公开。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

<details>

Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息损失，影响高保真应用。需要一种能够实现无损投影的方法。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断关键参数（激光束配置、角度分布和每束校准校正），实现无损投影和完整点云重建。

Result: 在KITTI和DurLAR数据集上实现完美点保留，所有点云零点损失，几何精度保持在传感器精度范围内，具有实时性能。

Conclusion: 从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变，为需要完整几何保留的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

TL;DR: 提出了DualGround双分支架构，通过分离全局和局部语义来改进视频时序定位任务，在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态注意力中统一处理所有文本标记，忽视了它们不同的语义角色，导致模型过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而未能有效利用词级信号，限制了细粒度时序对齐能力。

Method: 提出DualGround双分支架构：1）将[EOS]标记通过句子级路径处理，将词标记聚类成语义单元进行局部定位；2）引入基于标记角色的跨模态交互策略，以结构解耦方式对齐视频特征与句子级和短语级语义；3）联合建模框架同时改进全局句子级对齐和细粒度时序定位。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试中，DualGround在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦语义建模在视频-语言对齐中是有效的，能够同时捕捉粗粒度和局部化语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Conclusion: 为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了鲁棒的位置编码范式和上下文建模框架。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，引导融合过程达成更可靠的多模态共识，提升情感识别准确性

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

has made accessible to everyone including visually impaired individuals. With
the use of smartphone cameras, image capturing and processing have become more
convenient. With the use of smartphones and machine learning, the life of
visually impaired can be made a little easier. Daily tasks such as handling
money without relying on someone can be troublesome for them. For that purpose
this paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist
visually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset
containing 30 classes of notes and coins, representing 3 types of currency: US
dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Bangladeshi taka (BDT). Our approach uses a
YOLOv8 nano model with a custom detection head featuring deep convolutional
layers and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to enhance feature extraction and
detection accuracy. Our model has achieved a higher accuracy of 97.73%, recall
of 95.23%, f1-score of 95.85% and a mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5
(mAP50(B)) of 97.21\%. Using the voice feedback after the detection would help
the visually impaired to identify the currency. This paper aims to create a
practical and efficient currency detection system to empower visually impaired
individuals independent in handling money.

TL;DR: 提出GMFVAD方法，通过细粒度多模态特征减少视频异常检测中的冗余信息，在四个主要数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法在引入文本特征时方式粗糙，忽略了视频片段中可能存在的大量冗余信息

Method: 基于视频片段生成细粒度多模态特征，总结主要内容，并引入原始视频字幕的文本特征来增强视觉特征的突出部分

Result: 在四个主要数据集上实现了最先进的性能，消融实验验证了性能提升确实源于冗余信息的减少

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过利用多模态信息的多样性来细化提取特征，有效减少了视觉特征中的冗余，提升了视频异常检测性能

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Motivation: 解决复杂值合成孔径雷达图像识别中数据有限和领域偏移场景下的表示三难问题——同时优化泛化性、可解释性和效率的冲突需求。

Method: 基于'压缩-聚合-压缩'架构的KINN框架：物理引导压缩阶段使用字典处理器嵌入物理先验，稀疏展开网络提取物理基础特征；聚合模块丰富表示；语义压缩阶段使用紧凑分类头和自蒸馏学习任务相关嵌入。

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Conclusion: DMC³框架有效提升了第一人称视频问答的性能，通过反事实样本和对比学习解决了第一人称视角的独特挑战。

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 指令即推理范式显著提升了GUI接地性能，模型展现出新兴推理能力，能够在推理时选择性组合和合成新的指令路径。该方法缓解了SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题，为GUI代理提供了强大基础。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we

Conclusion: HyperET提供了一种灵活而高效的参数化策略，能够有效解决视觉与文本模态之间的粒度差距问题，显著提升多模态大语言模型的训练效率。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Motivation: 解决深度学习点云几何压缩中的泛化挑战，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对OOD数据的低效处理。

Method: 1. 通用上下文模型：利用空间和通道分组先验捕获鲁棒上下文依赖；2. 实例自适应微调(IAFT)：结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调少量网络权重并纳入比特流。

Result: 在15个多样化数据集上的广泛实验证实，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过创新的上下文建模和自适应微调策略，有效解决了点云压缩的泛化问题，为通用点云压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过考虑多步去噪过程中的误差累积，有效解决了扩散模型量化中的误差传播问题，为扩散模型的部署提供了高效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 位置编码在DiT中起着关键作用，PE-Field通过扩展位置编码到3D场，显著提升了DiT的3D几何建模能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

Motivation: 现有图像-食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱的文本细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致表示学习偏向主导视觉元素，难以区分具有细微差异的相似食谱。

Method: 采用因果方法预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习中以减轻偏差。

Conclusion: 所提出的因果表示学习方法能有效缓解图像-食谱检索中的模态偏差问题，在单语和多语言多文化数据集上都取得了优异的检索性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

TL;DR: Conan是一个用于证据基础的多步骤视频推理框架，通过识别上下文和证据帧、跨帧线索推理以及自适应决策，解决了现有方法在视觉基础和证据定位方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的视频推理方法依赖纯文本链，导致结论缺乏视觉基础或产生幻觉；而帧检索方法虽然引入视觉基础，但仍难以准确定位证据。

Method: 构建了Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，包含帧识别、证据推理和行动决策；设计了多阶段渐进冷启动策略与识别-推理-行动强化学习训练框架。

Result: 在六个多步骤推理基准测试中，Conan平均准确率比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct高出10%以上，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Conan在多步骤视频推理任务中表现出色，在长视频理解任务中也能有效泛化，验证了其强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Motivation: 人脸分析系统的公平性评估依赖于人口属性推断的可靠性，但现有方法存在偏差和方差问题，需要更可靠的推断流程来确保公平性审计的有效性。

Method: 采用模块化迁移学习方法，将预训练的人脸识别编码器与非线性分类头相结合，构建完全可复现的人口属性推断流程，并在准确性、公平性和鲁棒性三个维度进行评估。

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠基础，通过公开数据集元数据、代码库、预训练模型和评估工具包促进透明度和可复现性。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill是一个双向概念蒸馏框架，用于实现一步扩散个性化(1-SDP)，通过师生模型协同训练，在保持生成质量的同时实现快速概念个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前一步扩散模型虽然加速了图像生成，但在个性化新概念方面能力有限，难以有效捕捉新概念的分布。

Method: 采用端到端训练，同时训练多步扩散模型（教师）和一步扩散模型（学生），通过双向概念蒸馏和回声反馈机制，共享文本编码器，结合对抗损失和对齐损失优化学生模型。

Result: 实验表明该框架在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法，不仅提升了学生模型的概念个性化能力，还改善了教师模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型建立了一个快速有效个性化的新范式，通过双向协作机制实现了概念蒸馏和生成质量的共同提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了Metis-HOME框架，通过混合专家架构解决多模态推理模型在效率与泛化能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大推理模型存在两个关键限制：对简单查询使用计算昂贵的推理导致效率低下，以及专注于专业推理损害了更广泛的通用理解能力。

Method: 将原始密集模型重构为两个专家分支：思考分支处理复杂多步推理，非思考分支优化快速直接推理任务。使用轻量级可训练路由器动态分配查询。基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B构建MoE架构。

Result: 不仅显著增强了复杂推理能力，还改善了模型的通用能力，逆转了其他推理专用模型中观察到的性能退化趋势。

Conclusion: 建立了一个构建强大且多功能MLLM的新范式，有效解决了普遍存在的推理与泛化之间的困境。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)框架，通过细粒度面部区域概念划分和新的Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，解决了现有可解释深度伪造分析方法缺乏细粒度感知能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在不足：数据标注不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法输出文本伪造解释与视觉伪影证据之间的连接，也不支持任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 首先定义面部图像概念树(FICT)进行细粒度区域划分，构建FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程；然后提出Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，生成包含分割掩码的文本伪造解释；最后设计统一的多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线模型，在现有XDFA数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度数据标注和统一的多任务架构，显著提升了可解释深度伪造分析的性能，解决了现有方法缺乏细粒度感知的问题。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度学习框架，能够从单张模糊图像中联合估计潜在清晰图像和相机运动轨迹，在严重或空间变化模糊情况下实现最先进的去模糊性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机抖动导致的大范围或旋转运动模糊仍然是图像恢复中的主要挑战，现有端到端去模糊网络在严重模糊情况下表现不佳。

Method: 使用投影运动模糊模型(PMBM)，通过可微分模糊创建模块实现。神经网络预测完整的3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的端到端恢复网络训练，并通过后处理的再模糊损失优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上均达到最先进性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法的模块化架构提供了可解释性，能够揭示产生模糊的相机运动，并重建生成观察模糊图像的清晰图像序列。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费级相机系统在复杂光照条件下（如低光、高动态范围、背光）难以保持稳定的图像质量，导致曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，影响下游视觉任务的性能。

Method: 提出ACamera-Net框架，包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO以缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子以改善色彩一致性。该网络针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像管道中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下泛化良好。大量实验表明，ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法，且不依赖额外的图像增强模块。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net通过直接预测相机参数有效解决了复杂光照条件下的图像质量问题，为边缘设备提供了一种轻量级、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理模型仅生成文本推理轨迹，不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置。将证据中心推理扩展到视频更具挑战性，需要跨动态场景的联合时间跟踪和空间定位。

Method: 构建了两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k和STGR-RL-36k，采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计了多个专门奖励来共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试中达到最先进性能，mAM提升14.4%，mLGM提升24.2%。在多个视频理解基准测试中均观察到一致改进。

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video不仅提高了准确性，其生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值的信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Conclusion: GenColorBench将为精确颜色生成的改进提供指导，基准测试将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的跨模态分割框架能有效解决领域适应问题，提升模型在未见数据上的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决单目视频中自由移动物体重建的挑战，特别是在没有可靠姿态或深度线索以及任意物体运动的情况下。

Method: 使用第一帧作为锚点，通过密集高斯基元场逐步细化物体表示；核心贡献是双键内存模块，结合潜在外观-几何键和显式方向键，通过空间引导内存读取和高效稀疏化机制融合当前帧特征与时间聚合的物体状态。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理自由移动物体的重建，提供全面而紧凑的物体覆盖，在计算效率和重建质量方面表现出色。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频内容复杂多样且时间分散，现有视频大语言模型处理长序列计算成本高且推理不聚焦不一致。现有帧选择方法忽略时间依赖或依赖单模态证据，无法提供完整且与查询相关的上下文。

Method: 包含两个关键组件：1) SVCFS模块通过时间感知语义分支（利用LLM对字幕推理）和聚类引导视觉分支（通过互信息对齐嵌入与语义分数）选择帧；2) ACR模块通过融合证据和约束答案空间来解决语义和视觉预测间的不一致性。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 证明了共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型的重要性，SeViCES框架能够有效可靠地进行长视频理解。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: BTB3D提出了一种因果卷积编码器-解码器架构，通过三阶段训练课程生成紧凑的频率感知体积标记，在3D医学影像的视觉-语言建模中实现了更好的报告生成和文本到CT合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理高分辨率、长序列的3D医学影像时存在困难：对比预训练产生的视觉编码器与临床语言不匹配，切片级标记化会模糊精细解剖结构，降低下游任务的诊断性能。

Method: 采用因果卷积编码器-解码器统一2D和3D训练与推理，生成紧凑的频率感知体积标记。通过三阶段训练课程：局部重建、重叠窗口平铺和长上下文解码器精炼。

Result: 在报告生成任务中，BLEU分数提升，临床F1比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成任务中，FID降低75%，FVD减半，生成解剖学一致的512*512*241体积。

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化对于3D医学影像中可扩展的视觉-语言建模至关重要，而非仅仅依赖更大的语言骨干网络。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

TL;DR: 本文提出了UltraHR-100K超高清文本到图像数据集和频率感知后训练方法，解决了超高清图像生成中的数据集缺失和细节合成训练策略问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高清文本到图像生成中的两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量超高清数据集，以及忽视针对超高清场景的细粒度细节合成训练策略。

Method: 1) 构建UltraHR-100K数据集，包含10万张分辨率超过3K的高质量图像；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则化(SWFR)。

Result: 在提出的UltraHR-eval4K基准测试上，该方法显著提升了超高清图像生成的细粒度细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据集和训练策略有效解决了超高清文本到图像生成的关键挑战，显著提升了生成图像的细节质量。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

TL;DR: 提出了两种技术来减少多比特量化网络的训练开销：权重偏置校正和比特级核心集采样，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多比特量化网络方法存在显著的训练开销问题，因为需要为每个支持的比特宽度重复完整数据集更新，且通常需要额外的微调阶段来支持更多精度选项。

Method: 使用权重偏置校正技术实现共享批归一化，消除微调需求；采用比特级核心集采样策略，让每个子模型在紧凑的信息子集上训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的准确率的同时，将训练时间减少高达7.88倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了多比特量化网络的训练开销问题，在保持模型效用的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation
suite to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV是一种新颖的KV缓存压缩方法，通过结合重要性和多样性来优化大型视觉语言模型中的多模态KV缓存压缩，在极端压缩条件下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对来最小化存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，导致语义覆盖不足。

Method: MixKV方法分析KV缓存在不同注意力头中的冗余程度，自适应地平衡多样性和重要性来压缩KV对，而不是仅依赖重要性。

Result: 在极端压缩（预算=64）下，MixKV将基线方法平均提升5.1%，在GUI接地任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别获得8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过结合重要性和多样性有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩中的语义覆盖问题，在多种LVLM和LLM中均表现出色。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和视频插值，有效解决了长时域驾驶场景生成的几何一致性问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Motivation: 扩散变换器在超高分辨率图像生成时面临自注意力机制二次缩放带来的高昂计算成本问题，需要一种无需重新训练就能扩展分辨率的方法。

Method: 利用扩散过程的频谱特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码，使其频率谱与当前生成阶段匹配，从而适应不同分辨率的生成需求。

Conclusion: DyPE提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案，显著扩展了预训练扩散变换器的分辨率能力，在高分辨率下性能提升尤为明显。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

Motivation: 发现MeanFlow目标自然分解为轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两个部分，这两个术语存在强负相关性，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出α-Flow目标家族，统一了轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用课程学习策略平滑地从轨迹流匹配过渡到MeanFlow。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow始终优于MeanFlow，α-Flow-XL/2+模型使用vanilla DiT主干实现了SOTA结果：FID 2.58(1-NFE)和2.15(2-NFE)。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦冲突目标实现了更好的收敛性能，为少步生成建模提供了有效的优化框架。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: 解决从单张2D图像准确推断相机姿态、3D形状和纹理的挑战，将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，实现姿态和形状的联合估计。

Method: 采用两阶段流匹配管道：粗阶段生成初始3D几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复；精炼阶段整合姿态对齐的图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Conclusion: Cupid通过统一的生成框架实现了鲁棒的姿态和形状估计，在3D重建任务中表现出色，为单图像3D重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Motivation: 现有研究大多低估雷达作用，仅将其作为辅助角色，尽管雷达能提供准确的目标3D位置信息。本文旨在充分发挥雷达的关键作用，减少人工干预。

Method: 开发雷达-相机融合MOT框架，利用在线校准自主关联两个传感器的检测结果；使用共同特征准确推导物体真实位置；采用特征匹配和类别一致性检查超越单纯位置匹配的限制。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

*Xiaolong Wang,Lixiang Ru,Ziyuan Huang,Kaixiang Ji,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ARGenSeg框架，通过自回归生成方式实现图像分割，将多模态理解和像素级感知统一在一个框架中，显著提升推理速度并保持强大理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用边界点表示或专用分割头，依赖离散表示或语义提示输入任务特定解码器，限制了MLLM捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 基于图像生成的分割框架，利用MLLM输出视觉标记，通过通用VQ-VAE解码为图像，采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成视觉标记以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越先前最先进方法，推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg框架成功实现了多模态理解和像素级感知的统一，在保持强大理解能力的同时大幅提升分割性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

*Dean L Slack,G Thomas Hudson,Thomas Winterbottom,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于纯Transformer的自回归视频预测模型，在物理模拟数据集上显著延长了物理准确预测的时间范围，无需复杂训练策略或潜在特征学习组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型性能和可扩展性启发，将Transformer应用于视频预测领域，专注于解决现有视频生成方法在物理模拟时间因果建模方面的不足。

Method: 使用纯Transformer模型进行自回归视频预测，采用连续像素空间表示，比较不同的时空自注意力布局，通过物理对象跟踪指标和无监督训练来隔离时空推理能力。

Result: 与现有潜在空间方法相比，物理准确预测的时间范围延长了50%，同时在常见视频质量指标上保持相当性能。通过可解释性实验发现网络能够准确估计PDE模拟参数，且泛化到分布外参数估计。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

### [81] [Small Drafts, Big Verdict: Information-Intensive Visual Reasoning via Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20812)
*Yuhan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verdict (SV)框架，通过轻量级草稿专家生成多样化推理路径，再由大型裁决模型合成最终答案，在信息密集型视觉问答任务中实现错误校正和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理信息密集型图像时面临挑战，这些图像密集交织文本注释和细粒度图形元素，需要精确定位关键线索和多跳推理来整合分散证据。

Method: 采用训练免费的推测解码框架，包含草稿阶段和裁决阶段。草稿阶段使用小型VLM作为专家生成多样化定位候选的推理路径；裁决阶段由强大VLM合成这些路径产生最终答案，并引入共识专家选择机制仅转发高一致性路径。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K等具有挑战性的信息密集和高分辨率视觉问答基准测试中取得持续增益。

Conclusion: SV通过合成多个部分准确推理路径中的正确见解，相比大型专有模型或训练流程，实现了错误校正和成本效益的平衡。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

### [82] [SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20814)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph是一个物理引导的自监督高光谱超分辨率框架，通过解混瓶颈结构实现高光谱和多光谱图像融合，在单波段多光谱图像下仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，且在MSI波段很少时表现不佳。需要开发既保持性能又具备物理可解释性的融合方法。

Method: 使用解混瓶颈：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用多层感知机从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，通过MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行自监督训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线方法，与监督基线方法相比也很有竞争力。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph提供了可解释的中间结果，训练时间不到一分钟，即使在单波段MSI下也保持鲁棒性，为高光谱超分辨率提供了物理引导的自监督解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

*Nimrod Berman,Omkar Joglekar,Eitan Kosman,Dotan Di Castro,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LDDBM框架，一种基于潜在变量扩展的扩散桥模型，用于解决跨模态转换问题，支持任意模态对之间的转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但在跨模态转换方面存在限制，如需要共享维度、高斯先验假设和特定模态架构，限制了通用性和理论基础。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中学习桥接任意模态，使用对比对齐损失确保语义一致性，设计领域无关的编码器-解码器架构进行潜在空间噪声预测，并提出预测损失指导训练。

Result: 在多种模态转换任务上表现优异，包括多视图到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视图场景合成，建立了跨模态转换的新基准。

Conclusion: LDDBM提供了一个通用且理论严谨的跨模态转换框架，能够处理任意模态对，为通用模态转换建立了新的强基线。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体个性化文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现精确的空间控制和身份保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且在多个主体场景下表现不佳。

Method: 提出分层画布表示，每个主体放在独立层上实现无遮挡组合；采用锁定机制保持选定层的高保真度，其余层灵活适应上下文；无需架构改变，利用位置嵌入和互补数据采样策略。

Result: 在多个主体个性化图像生成任务中，相比现有最优方法，LayerComposer实现了更优越的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过分层画布和锁定机制，为多主体个性化图像生成提供了有效的交互控制解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

*Yihao Meng,Hao Ouyang,Yue Yu,Qiuyu Wang,Wen Wang,Ka Leong Cheng,Hanlin Wang,Yixuan Li,Cheng Chen,Yanhong Zeng,Yujun Shen,Huamin Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloCine模型通过整体生成整个场景来解决文本到视频模型在创建连贯多镜头叙事方面的不足，实现了从剪辑合成到自动化电影制作的关键转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频模型在生成连贯多镜头叙事方面的"叙事鸿沟"，这些模型擅长生成孤立片段但无法创建连贯的叙事场景。

Method: 采用Window Cross-Attention机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，同时使用稀疏的镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集但镜头间稀疏），确保分钟级生成的效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出显著的新兴能力：对角色和场景的持久记忆，以及对电影技术的直观理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从剪辑合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Soft robotics increasingly relies on smart materials and innovative
structures, with bistable tape springs emerging as a promising option. These
structures exhibit intriguing dynamic behaviors, such as oscillation, due to
their inherent bistability. This paper explores the high-speed linear
amplification of motion achieved through the excitation of a looped bistable
tape spring. When looped, the tape spring forms two distinct joints,
facilitating smooth oscillation. Mounted on a linear guide and driven by a
crank mechanism with varying frequency, the system converts input oscillations
into amplified linear motion at resonance. This study highlights the potential
of bistable tape springs high speed reciprocating linear motion.

Conclusion: 提出的信息论框架和IMAS²算法为多智能体主动感知问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of jointly selecting sensing agents and synthesizing
decentralized active perception policies for the chosen subset of agents within
a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP)
framework. Our approach employs a two-layer optimization structure. In the
inner layer, we introduce information-theoretic metrics, defined by the mutual
information between the unknown trajectories or some hidden property in the
environment and the collective partial observations in the multi-agent system,
as a unified objective for active perception problems. We employ various
optimization methods to obtain optimal sensor policies that maximize mutual
information for distinct active perception tasks. In the outer layer, we prove
that under certain conditions, the information-theoretic objectives are
monotone and submodular with respect to the subset of observations collected
from multiple agents. We then exploit this property to design an IMAS$^2$
(Information-theoretic Multi-Agent Selection and Sensing) algorithm for joint
sensing agent selection and sensing policy synthesis. However, since the policy
search space is infinite, we adapt the classical Nemhauser-Wolsey argument to
prove that the proposed IMAS$^2$ algorithm can provide a tight $(1 -
1/e)$-guarantee on the performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in a multi-agent cooperative perception in a grid-world
environment.

Method: 训练神经网络模仿专家EMPC控制动作，包含噪声注入以增强鲁棒性，并显式考虑可再生能源和需求预测的不确定性。

Result: 学习策略在经济性能上与EMPC相当，但计算时间仅为基于优化的EMPC的10%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效近似EMPC性能，显著降低计算负担，适合实时微电网能量管理应用。

Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential for reliable and sustainable
microgrid operation amid increasing renewable integration. This paper proposes
an imitation learning-based framework to approximate mixed-integer Economic
Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for microgrid energy management. The proposed
method trains a neural network to imitate expert EMPC control actions from
offline trajectories, enabling fast, real-time decision making without solving
optimization problems online. To enhance robustness and generalization, the
learning process includes noise injection during training to mitigate
distribution shift and explicitly incorporates forecast uncertainty in
renewable generation and demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the
learned policy achieves economic performance comparable to EMPC while only
requiring $10\%$ of the computation time of optimization-based EMPC in
practice.

Motivation: 解决在缺乏完整状态测量情况下如何保证系统安全性和调节性能的问题，特别是在存在状态估计误差时确保安全。

Method: 使用控制屏障函数构建防护控制器，将安全目标与学习目标解耦，并结合基于深度神经网络的自适应观测器来处理状态估计误差。

Result: 通过Lyapunov分析提供了安全性和收敛性保证，在温和激励条件下的仿真验证了控制器的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将状态估计和参数估计集成到自适应控制框架中，在缺乏完整状态测量的情况下仍能保证系统安全性和稳定性。

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a safe control synthesis method that integrates
state estimation and parameter estimation within an adaptive optimal control
(AOC) and control barrier function (CBF)-based control architecture. The
developed approach decouples safety objectives from the learning objectives
using a CBF-based guarding controller where the CBFs are robustified to account
for the lack of full-state measurements. The coupling of this guarding
controller with the AOC-based stabilizing control guarantees safety and
regulation despite the lack of full state measurement. The paper leverages
recent advancements in deep neural network-based adaptive observers to ensure
safety in the presence of state estimation errors. Safety and convergence
guarantees are provided using a Lyapunov-based analysis, and the effectiveness
of the developed controller is demonstrated through simulation under mild
excitation conditions.

reasoning with advanced speech processing modules, providing adaptive support
tailored to diverse impairment types. To ensure real-world practicality, we

Conclusion: IDs框架为PMU数据压缩提供了严格误差界限，DEIM算法能有效控制压缩质量并实现系统运行状态变化的检测。

Abstract: This work investigates the reduction of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data
through low-rank matrix approximations. To reconstruct a PMU data matrix from
fewer measurements, we propose the framework of interpolatory matrix
decompositions (IDs). In contrast to methods relying on principal component
analysis or singular value decomposition, IDs recover the complete data matrix
using only a few of its rows (PMU datastreams) and/or a few of its columns
(snapshots in time). This compression enables the real-time monitoring of power
transmission systems using a limited number of measurements, thereby minimizing
communication bandwidth. The ID perspective gives a rigorous error bound on the
quality of the data compression. We propose selecting rows and columns used in
an ID via the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a greedy
algorithm that aims to control the error bound. This bound leads to a
computable estimate for the reconstruction error during online operations. A
violation of this estimate suggests a change in the system's operating
conditions, and thus serves as a tool for fault detection. Numerical tests
using synthetic PMU data illustrate DEIM's excellent performance for data
compression, and validate the proposed DEIM-based fault-detection method.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合聚光太阳能技术和低成本沙基储热系统的太阳能-热直接空气捕集系统，能够实现80%以上的年容量因子和160-200美元/吨的二氧化碳去除成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脱碳经济和满足全球能源需求的双重挑战需要可扩展且成本效益高的二氧化碳去除技术，而直接空气捕集的高能耗（特别是吸附剂再生所需的热能）是其成本降低和可持续部署的关键障碍。

Method: 结合聚光太阳能技术与低成本沙基储热系统，分析并网和独立配置下的技术经济性能，使用与太阳能可用性匹配的短周期吸附剂。

Result: 太阳能-热DAC可实现超过80%的年容量因子和160-200美元/吨的CO2去除成本，独立系统在太阳能资源丰富且多沙地区表现最佳，全球沙质地形可支持超过26吉吨/年的DAC容量。

Conclusion: 太阳能驱动的DAC系统在具有适宜CO2储存沉积盆地的地区，为地热加热提供了成本更低的替代方案，且具有最小的环境敏感性。

Abstract: The dual challenge of decarbonizing the economy and meeting rising global
energy demand underscores the need for scalable and cost-effective carbon
dioxide removal technologies. Direct air capture (DAC) is among the most
promising approaches, but its high energy intensity, particularly the thermal
energy required for sorbent regeneration, remains a critical barrier to cost
reduction and sustainable deployment. This study explores solar-thermal DAC
systems that combine concentrated solar thermal technology with low-cost
sand-based thermal energy storage to meet this demand. We analyze the
techno-economic performance of such systems in both grid-connected and
stand-alone configurations. Results show that solar-thermal DAC can achieve
annual capacity factors exceeding 80% and CO2 removal costs as low as 160-200
USD per ton, making it competitive with leading DAC technologies. The proposed
system operates most efficiently with short-cycle sorbents that align with
solar availability. The stand-alone Solar-DAC systems, which rely solely on
solar energy for both electricity and thermal energy, are particularly
promising in regions with high solar capacity and sandy terrain, exhibiting
minimal ambient sensitivity from temperature and humidity. An optimal 6000
ton/yr modular system design takes <1 km2 land-use requirement and potentially
>26 Gt/year DAC capacity is identified for sandy terrain alone globally. In
areas with sedimentary basins suitable for CO2 storage, solar-powered DAC
offers a lower-cost alternative to geothermal heating, which often faces
geological and economic constraints.

Abstract: This paper proposes a simulation-based reinforcement learning algorithm for
controlling systems with uncertain and varying system parameters. While
simulators are useful for safely learning control policies for physical
systems, mitigating the reality gap remains a major challenge. To address the
challenge, we propose a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, multiple
control policies are learned for systems with different parameters in a
simulator. In the second stage, for a real system, the control policies learned
in the first stage are smoothly switched using an online convex optimization
algorithm based on observations. Our proposed algorithm is demonstrated through
numerical experiments.

Motivation: 控制屏障函数在欧几里得空间已有完善理论，但在机器人和航空航天应用中常见的流形系统上仍缺乏一般公式和构造性合成工具。

Method: 开发了流形上几何CBF的一般理论，推广了基于动能的CBF反步法到黎曼流形，利用机械结构避免高阶切丛上的计算。

Result: 为几何机械系统提供了构造性CBF合成技术，并给出了易于验证的成功条件，在SO(3)上的欠驱动卫星上进行了应用演示。

Conclusion: 提出的几何CBF理论为流形系统提供了有效的安全控制框架，避免了复杂的高阶计算，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have a well-established theory in Euclidean
spaces, yet still lack general formulations and constructive synthesis tools
for systems evolving on manifolds common in robotics and aerospace
applications. In this paper, we develop a general theory of geometric CBFs on
bundles and, for control-affine systems, recover the standard
optimization-based CBF controllers and their smooth analogues. Then, by
generalizing kinetic energy-based CBF backstepping to Riemannian manifolds, we
provide a constructive CBF synthesis technique for geometric mechanical
systems, as well as easily verifiable conditions under which it succeeds.
Further, this technique utilizes mechanical structure to avoid computations on
higher-order tangent bundles. We demonstrate its application to an
underactuated satellite on SO(3).

Method: 采用分层优化方法，通过智能建筑协调器、微电网协调器和配电系统协调器三个独立运行的协调器，仅交换有限信息来实现最优解。

Result: 数值模拟显示该平台能有效协调用户侧资源与配电系统的运行。

Conclusion: 该平台具有灵活可扩展的架构，能保护用户隐私数据，实现智能建筑资源与配电系统的有效协调。

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-actor coordination platform for the optimal
utilization of smart buildings resources, including roof top PV generation and
battery energy storage system (BESS), in active power distribution systems. The
proposed multi-actor coordination includes the Smart Building Coordinator
(SBC), Micro-Grid Coordinator (MGC) and Distribution System Coordinator (DSC).
The coordinators operate independently and only exchange limited information
with each other to reach an optimal solution. In the proposed platform, a
hierarchical optimization problem is solved to optimally determine the
operating point of all distribution system resources. The proposed platform
fully preserves the confidentiality of the behind the meter (BTM) data of the
buildings since no information about the status of the PV system, BESS, and
load of the building is shared with the owner of the power system. The proposed
platform has a flexible and scalable architecture where the computational task
of coordinating microgrids and smart buildings with distribution grid is
performed locally at the MGC and SBC layers, respectively. Numerical
simulations show the efficacy of the proposed platform in coordinating the BTM
resources with the rest of the distribution system.

TL;DR: MAiCaS是一种多功能天线集成电容传感平台，通过利用电感天线的寄生电容作为应变敏感元件，将传感、遥测和机械功能统一到紧凑设计中，实现无源、无线、实时心血管监测。

Motivation: 传统心血管监测系统需要分离的传感器和无线模块，制造复杂且成本高。MAiCaS旨在开发一种集成化、可扩展的解决方案，简化制造流程并提高可重复性。

Method: 采用无洁净室、单步UV激光图案化工艺在柔性PDMS基底上制造传感器。通过S11参数测量和共振频率偏移作为输出指标，实现无线询问。验证了传感器在展开和卷曲形式下对应变、压力和变形的无线共振响应。

Conclusion: MAiCaS的单片传感器架构为血管动力学无电池监测提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，具有远程诊断、术后随访和持续心血管健康管理的潜力。

Abstract: We present a multifunctional, antenna-integrated capacitive sensing (MAiCaS)
platform for passive, wireless, and real-time cardiovascular monitoring. Unlike
conventional systems that require separate sensors and wireless modules, our
device unifies sensing, telemetry, and mechanical functionality into a compact
and scalable design by exploiting the parasitic capacitance of an inductive
antenna as a strain-sensitive element. The sensor is fabricated using a
cleanroom-free, single-step UV laser patterning process on a flexible PDMS
substrate, reducing manufacturing complexity and enabling high reproducibility.
The MAiCaS is suitable for three different applications: as a sensor for
epicardial strain measurement, a stent as a sensor, and a vascular graft
sensor. We demonstrate MAiCaS's versatility by validating its wireless
resonance-based response to strain, pressure, and deformation across unrolled
and rolled forms. In vitro experiments demonstrated consistent resonance
frequency shifts under physiological conditions, with stable performance on
skin, in PBS, human serum, and simulated vascular environments. Repeatability
and aging tests confirmed its long-term reliability and elasticity under cyclic
loading. Calibration curves revealed high sensitivity across all
configurations, with wireless interrogation achieved through S11 parameter
measurements and resonance frequency shift as the output metric. The
sensitivity of the device was measured to be 2.9 MHz per 1% strain, 0.43
MHz/mmHg, and 309.6kHz/\textmu m for epicardial patch, graft, and stent
integrated sensor, respectively. The operation of MAiCaS was evaluated in a
human experiment. This monolithic sensor architecture provides a scalable and
cost-effective solution for battery-free monitoring of vascular dynamics, with
potential for remote diagnostics, post-surgical follow-up, and continuous
cardiovascular health management.

Abstract: Predicting the motion of surrounding vehicles is key to safe autonomous
driving, especially in unstructured environments without prior information.
This paper proposes a novel online method to accurately predict the occupancy
sets of surrounding vehicles based solely on motion observations. The approach
is divided into two stages: first, an Extended Kalman Filter and a Linear
Programming (LP) problem are used to estimate a compact zonotopic set of
control actions; then, a reachability analysis propagates this set to predict
future occupancy. The effectiveness of the method has been validated through
simulations in an urban environment, showing accurate and compact predictions
without relying on prior assumptions or prior training data.

Conclusion: JCORM算法能有效优化卫星-空中-海洋物联网网络，在满足延迟约束的同时显著提升数据收集效率和系统性能。

Abstract: Devices within the marine Internet of Things (MIoT) can connect to low Earth
orbit (LEO) satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to facilitate
low-latency data transmission and execution, as well as enhanced-capacity data
storage. However, without proper traffic handling strategy, it is still
difficult to effectively meet the low-latency requirements. In this paper, we
consider a cooperative satellite-aerial-MIoT network (CSAMN) for maritime edge
computing and maritime data storage to prioritize delay-sensitive (DS) tasks by
employing mobile edge computing, while handling delay-tolerant (DT) tasks via
the store-carry-forward method. Considering the delay constraints of DS tasks,
we formulate a constrained joint optimization problem of maximizing
satellite-collected data volume while minimizing system energy consumption by
controlling four interdependent variables, including the transmit power of UAVs
for DS tasks, the start time of DT tasks, computing resource allocation, and
offloading ratio. To solve this non-convex and non-linear problem, we propose a
joint computation offloading and resource management (JCORM) algorithm using
the Dinkelbach method and linear programming. Our results show that the volume
of data collected by the proposed JCORM algorithm can be increased by up to
41.5% compared to baselines. Moreover, JCORM algorithm achieves a dramatic
reduction in computational time, from a maximum of 318.21 seconds down to just
0.16 seconds per experiment, making it highly suitable for real-time maritime
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电力系统中基于变换器的资源比例增加，需要可扩展的稳定性分析方法，而现有的分散小增益和小相位准则由于扇形性假设在低频段不满足，限制了其在电网形成变换器中的应用。

Method: 引入回路整形变换，在替代坐标系中重新表述变换器和网络模型，扩展混合增益相位条件，解决低频固有非扇形性问题。

Result: 该方法成功解决了低频非扇形性问题，降低了保守性，在无限总线系统和IEEE 14总线网络中验证了方法的实用性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为电力电网中提供更不保守和更广泛适用的分散稳定性证书开辟了途径。

Abstract: The increasing share of converter based resources in power systems calls for
scalable methods to analyse stability without relying on exhaustive system wide
simulations. Decentralized small gain and small-phase criteria have recently
been proposed for this purpose, but their applicability to grid forming
converters is severely limited by the sectoriality assumption, which is not
typically satisfied at low frequencies. This work revisits and extends mixed
gain phase conditions by introducing loop shaping transformations that
reformulate converter and network models in alternative coordinate frames. The
proposed approach resolves intrinsic non sectoriality at low frequencies and
reduces conservativeness, thereby improving the applicability of decentralized
stability certification. Analytical results are illustrated using an infinite
bus system first and then extended to the IEEE 14 bus network, demonstrating
the practicality and scalability of the method. These findings provide a
pathway toward less conservative and more widely applicable decentralized
stability certificates in power grids.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a decentralized optimization-based density
controller designed to enforce set invariance constraints in multi-robot
systems. By designing a decentralized control barrier function, we derived
sufficient conditions under which local safety constraints guarantee global
safety. We account for localization and motion noise explicitly by modeling
robots as spatial probability density functions governed by the Fokker-Planck
equation. Compared to traditional centralized approaches, our controller
requires less computational and communication power, making it more suitable
for deployment in situations where perfect communication and localization are
impractical. The controller is validated through simulations and experiments
with four quadcopters.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and deployment of a process-aware
cyber-physical system that automates plant-level logistics, traceability, and
sanitation in a centralized maple-syrup boiling center. The system replaces
ad-hoc, manual operations with event-driven orchestration on a local server,
employing reusable device abstractions and a centralized interlock with
priority-based arbitration for shared piping. It implements deterministic
routines for delivery, reverse osmosis integration, evaporator feed, and
permeate management. The system is sensor rich: inline measurements of flow,
temperature, and sugar concentration (degrees Brix) drive routing decisions and
trigger systematic post-transfer rinses (cleaning-in-place), ensuring
consistent hygiene and complete, immediate traceability up to the evaporator
inlet. During the 2025 production season, the system queued 431 operations
without incident; executed 908 \enquote{topstock} and \enquote{downstock}
balancing cycles; increased usable permeate reserves from 22,712 to
approximately 41,640 L through dynamic storage assignment; eliminated
mid-season contamination incidents previously observed under manual practice;
and reduced administrative effort for billing and reporting from more than 30
hours to roughly 1 hour through automatic documentation. These results
demonstrate a practical path to modular, plant-scale automation beyond
traditional architectures, and lay the groundwork for packaging reusable
elements for similar plants or adjacent industries. This work is part of a
larger project involving the first scientifically-documented integration of
Industry 4.0 technologies in a maple syrup boiling center.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督学习方法在最优潮流问题中只要求约束在问题实例的平均意义上满足，无法确保每个具体实例的约束都得到满足，因此需要开发能保证逐点约束满足的训练方法。

Method: 将学习参数化直接代入带约束的最优潮流问题，在双域中使用增强拉格朗日和对偶梯度上升算法进行训练，要求约束在所有问题实例中都成立。

Result: 数值实验表明，逐点约束训练产生的解具有更小的约束违反，在约束最难满足的极端情况下效果最明显，在具有大量母线的电力系统中收益最为显著。

Conclusion: 逐点约束训练方法能有效减少最优潮流问题中的约束违反，特别是在约束难以满足的极端情况和大型电力系统中表现优异。

Abstract: Training learning parameterizations to solve optimal power flow (OPF) with
pointwise constraints is proposed. In this novel training approach, a learning
parameterization is substituted directly into an OPF problem with constraints
required to hold over all problem instances. This is different from existing
supervised learning methods in which constraints are required to hold across
the average of problem instances. Training with pointwise constraints is
undertaken in the dual domain with the use of augmented Lagrangian and dual
gradient ascent algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training with
pointwise constraints produces solutions with smaller constraint violations.
Experiments further demonstrated that pointwise constraints are most effective
at reducing constraint violations in corner cases - defined as those
realizations in which constraints are most difficult to satisfy. Gains are most
pronounced in power systems with large numbers of buses.

Method: 建立双层优化框架：上层是数据中心最小化电力成本和边际排放强度的加权组合，下层是系统运营商在传输和发电约束下进行经济调度。使用三节点电力系统推导闭式分段线性表达式。

Result: 识别了数据中心分散决策与社会最优行为一致或分歧的充分条件，表征了由此产生的外部性。揭示了系统拓扑和发电机不对称性如何影响激励协调。

Conclusion: 边际价格或排放信号可能无法引导灵活负荷实现社会效益，为分析碳感知激励下的分散灵活性提供了可处理起点，并指出了改进灵活负荷与系统运行协调的方向。

Abstract: Data centers are emerging as large, flexible electricity consumers capable of
shifting computational workloads across locations in response to economic and
environmental signals. While this flexibility has potential for emissions
reduction, its impact on power system operations depends critically on how such
behavior interacts with network constraints and market signals. We develop a
bilevel optimization framework in which a data center minimizes a weighted
combination of electricity cost and marginal emissions intensity (LME), while
the system operator clears economic dispatch under transmission and generation
constraints. Focusing on a stylized three-bus power system, we derive
closed-form, piecewise-linear expressions for both the data center and
system-wide objectives as functions of the data centers' load shift. These
expressions capture threshold-driven regime changes due to congestion and
renewable saturation. We identify sufficient conditions under which the data
center's decentralized decisions align with or diverge from socially optimal
behavior and characterize the resulting externalities. Our results reveal how
system topology and generator asymmetry affect incentive alignment and provide
insight into when marginal price or emissions signals may fail to guide
flexible loads toward socially beneficial outcomes. Our results offer a
tractable starting point for analyzing decentralized flexibility under
carbon-aware incentives and suggest directions for improving coordination
between flexible loads and system operations.

Conclusion: 提出的交互式可视化分析方法有效解决了复杂图像集合中关系分析的问题，为领域专家提供了实用的分析工具。

Abstract: Analyzing large complex image collections in domains like forensics, accident
investigation, or social media analysis involves interpreting intricate,
overlapping relationships among images. Traditional clustering and
classification methods fail to adequately represent these complex
relationships, particularly when labeled data or suitable pre-trained models
are unavailable. Hypergraphs effectively capture overlapping relationships, but
to translate their complexity into information and insights for domain expert
users visualization is essential. We propose an interactive visual analytics
approach specifically designed for the construction, exploration, and analysis
of hypergraphs on large-scale complex image collections. Our core contributions
include: (1) a scalable pipeline for constructing hypergraphs directly from raw
image data, including a similarity measure to evaluate constructed hypergraphs
against a ground truth, (2) interactive visualization techniques that integrate
spatial hypergraph representations, interactive grids, and matrix
visualizations, enabling users to dynamically explore and interpret
relationships without becoming overwhelmed and disoriented, and (3) practical
insights on how domain experts can effectively use the application, based on
evaluation with real-life image collections. Our results demonstrate that our
visual analytics approach facilitates iterative exploration, enabling domain
experts to efficiently derive insights from image collections containing tens
of thousands of images.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM对用户观点的影响，但缺乏对双向影响和多轮对话中动态变化的深入探讨。

Method: 通过50个争议话题讨论，招募266名参与者在三种条件下进行实验：静态陈述、标准聊天机器人和个性化聊天机器人。

Result: 人类观点几乎不变，LLM输出变化显著，缩小了人机立场差距。个性化设置强化了双向变化，涉及个人故事的对话最易引发立场变化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人机交互中过度对齐的风险，需要更谨慎地设计个性化聊天机器人以实现更稳定和深思熟虑的对齐。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion
exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work
extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM
responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the
multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50
controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three
conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.
Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more
substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization
amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.
Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving
participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for
both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in
human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots
to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI如何作为家庭学习的中介，通过分配任务、可视化贡献和提供个性化支持来缓解家庭协作中的协调问题和工作量不均，从而丰富共享学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI学习系统多为儿童中心设计，忽视了家庭教育的协作性和分布式特性，导致家庭学习中存在协调困难、工作量不均和家长调解问题。

Method: 通过形成性研究识别家庭学习挑战，设计开发了FamLearn原型系统（基于LLM），并进行为期一周的11个家庭实地研究。

Result: 研究表明该原型能够减轻照护负担、促进贡献认可、丰富共享学习体验，LLM可超越辅导角色成为家庭调解者。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为家庭调解者，平衡责任、支持代际参与并加强家庭学习的关系结构，为AI在家庭协作学习中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Family learning takes place in everyday routines where children and
caregivers read, practice, and develop new skills together. Although AI is
increasingly present in learning environments, most systems remain
child-centered and overlook the collaborative, distributed nature of family
education. This paper investigates how AI can mediate family collaboration by
addressing tensions of coordination, uneven workloads, and parental mediation.
From a formative study with families using AI in daily learning, we identified
challenges in responsibility sharing and recognition of contributions. Building
on these insights, we designed FamLearn, an LLM-powered prototype that
distributes tasks, visualizes contributions, and provides individualized
support. A one-week field study with 11 families shows how this prototype can
ease caregiving burdens, foster recognition, and enrich shared learning
experiences. Our findings suggest that LLMs can move beyond the role of tutor
to act as family mediators - balancing responsibilities, scaffolding
intergenerational participation, and strengthening the relational fabric of
family learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一个三维设计空间（透明度、抽象度、模态）来系统化人机协作中的意图通信策略，并在三种不同场景中验证其适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有意图通信方法通常僵化、特定于代理且范围狭窄，缺乏将通信内容与通信方式和时机系统连接的可推广多模态策略。

Method: 引入包含透明度（通信内容）、抽象度（通信时机）和模态（通信方式）的三维设计空间，并在旁观者交互、协作任务和共享控制三种场景中应用验证。

Result: 该设计空间能够生成适应性、可扩展和跨领域的通信策略，填补了意图内容与通信实现之间的空白。

Conclusion: 该设计空间为设计更安全、直观和可转移的人机交互提供了基础框架。

Abstract: As autonomous agents, from self-driving cars to virtual assistants, become
increasingly present in everyday life, safe and effective collaboration depends
on human understanding of agents' intentions. Current intent communication
approaches are often rigid, agent-specific, and narrowly scoped, limiting their
adaptability across tasks, environments, and user preferences. A key gap
remains: existing models of what to communicate are rarely linked to systematic
choices of how and when to communicate, preventing the development of
generalizable, multi-modal strategies. In this paper, we introduce a
multidimensional design space for intent communication structured along three
dimensions: Transparency (what is communicated), Abstraction (when), and
Modality (how). We apply this design space to three distinct human-agent
collaboration scenarios: (a) bystander interaction, (b) cooperative tasks, and
(c) shared control, demonstrating its capacity to generate adaptable, scalable,
and cross-domain communication strategies. By bridging the gap between intent
content and communication implementation, our design space provides a
foundation for designing safer, more intuitive, and more transferable
agent-human interactions.

*Albert Dorador*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种雷达图特征排序优化方法，通过最小化多边形"尖刺度"来改善多变量数据可视化效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达图在特征值大小交替剧烈时会出现面积塌陷问题，严重损害视觉清晰度，误导相对差异的表示

Method: 使用排列优化策略重新排序特征，采用组合优化方法（穷举搜索）和词典最小最大准则，先考虑整体平滑度（平均跳跃），再用最大单次跳跃作为平局决胜器

Result: 该方法能同时最小化多个轮廓的多边形尖刺度，保留更多全局信息，产生视觉平衡的排列

Conclusion: 提出的特征排序优化方法能显著改善雷达图的视觉清晰度，比现有方法更好地保持数据表示的准确性

Abstract: Radar charts are widely used to visualize multivariate data and compare
multiple profiles across features. However, the visual clarity of radar charts
can be severely compromised when feature values alternate drastically in
magnitude around the circle, causing areas to collapse, which misrepresents
relative differences. In the present work we introduce a permutation
optimization strategy that reorders features to minimize polygon ``spikiness''
across multiple profiles simultaneously. The method is combinatorial
(exhaustive search) for moderate numbers of features and uses a lexicographic
minimax criterion that first considers overall smoothness (mean jump) and then
the largest single jump as a tie-breaker. This preserves more global
information and produces visually balanced arrangements. We discuss complexity,
practical bounds, and relations to existing approaches that either change the
visualization (e.g., OrigamiPlot) or learn orderings (e.g., Versatile Ordering
Network). An example with two profiles and $p=6$ features (before/after
ordering) illustrates the qualitative improvement.
  Keywords: data visualization, radar charts, combinatorial optimization,
minimax optimization, feature ordering

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Empathic Prompting是一个多模态人机交互框架，通过面部表情识别捕捉用户情绪线索，将其作为上下文信号融入LLM对话，无需显式用户控制即可实现流畅的情感对齐对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态界面需要显式用户控制，而情感信号在医疗、教育等领域的交流中至关重要但往往在语言交流中难以捕捉，因此需要一种能够自然融入非语言上下文的方法。

Method: 采用模块化可扩展架构，集成商用面部表情识别服务，将情感线索嵌入到提示中，通过本地部署的DeepSeek实例实现系统设计。

Result: 初步评估(N=5)显示系统能一致地将非语言输入整合到连贯的LLM输出中，参与者强调了对话的流畅性。

Conclusion: Empathic Prompting为聊天机器人中介的通信提供了应用前景，特别是在医疗和教育等领域，这些领域用户的情感信号至关重要但在语言交流中往往不透明。

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中，检索功能完全由自注意力层承担，SSM层无法补偿注意力缺失，表明严格的功能分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合架构中不同组件（SSM和注意力）的功能专门化程度，挑战关于架构冗余的假设。

Method: 通过注意力消融实验和稀疏化分析，测试RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型在检索任务中的表现。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索完全失败（0%准确率），而仅保留15%注意力头即可维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保持84%的MMLU表现。

Conclusion: 混合架构表现为专门化模块而非集成系统，自注意力主要负责检索任务，这对架构优化和可解释性有重要意义。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

TL;DR: NAS-DQN通过在DRL训练循环中集成神经架构搜索控制器，实现动态网络重构，显著优于固定架构设计，证明了架构自适应对在线深度强化学习的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习代理的性能受限于固定的神经网络架构，需要通过昂贵的超参数搜索确定，这限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出NAS-DQN代理，将学习到的神经架构搜索控制器直接集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN在最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性方面均优于固定架构基准和随机搜索控制，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 架构自适应不仅是有益的，而且是在线深度强化学习中实现最优样本效率的必要条件，RL代理的设计可以无缝集成为学习过程的动态组件。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

TL;DR: ReGraphT是一个无需训练的检索增强生成框架，通过将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，使用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索，使小型语言模型能够达到大型语言模型的推理水平，在CUDA代码生成任务中实现2.33倍平均加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在生成优化CUDA代码方面表现出色，但存在代码泄露风险和计算成本高的问题。小型语言模型更轻量且隐私友好，但在复杂CUDA生成任务中由于推理能力有限表现不佳。

Method: 提出ReGraphT框架：将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索，并创建了按推理复杂度分级的CUDA特定基准。

Result: ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval基准测试中平均实现2.33倍加速，优于HPC特定微调模型和其他检索增强方法。当与DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct和Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct配合使用时，使小型语言模型接近大型语言模型性能。

Conclusion: ReGraphT成功地将大型语言模型的推理能力转移到小型模型，解决了隐私风险和计算开销问题，在CUDA代码生成任务中实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer架构的深度学习模型，直接预测均衡路径流量，大幅降低交通分配问题的计算时间，适应需求变化和网络结构调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均衡原理的数学规划方法在大规模网络中计算复杂度非线性增长，计算成本过高。

Method: 使用Transformer架构的深度神经网络，直接预测均衡路径流量，捕捉OD对间的复杂相关性。

Result: 在多个网络上的实验表明，该模型比传统优化方法快几个数量级，能有效估计多类网络中的路径级交通流量，降低计算成本并提高预测精度。

Conclusion: 该模型能灵活适应变化的需求和网络条件，支持交通管理和快速"假设分析"，提升交通规划和政策制定能力。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程需要局部专业化和全局协调，但强化学习在工业应用中面临奖励设计、模块化和动作空间管理等挑战，现有学术基准与工业控制问题差异较大。

Method: 结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym两个基准任务，构建顺序回收场景，评估模块化架构（专业代理）与整体代理（全系统控制）两种策略，并分析动作掩码的影响。

Result: 无动作掩码时代理难以学习有效策略，模块化架构表现更好；应用动作掩码后两种架构都显著改善，性能差距缩小。

Conclusion: 动作空间约束起决定性作用，专业化优势随动作复杂度降低而减弱，该基准为工业自动化中多代理强化学习解决方案提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

Motivation: 医疗AI系统在诊断能力方面表现出色，但在不同人口群体间存在显著性能差异，对少数群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理基础模型通过强化学习训练时会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见

Method: FairGRPO是一种分层强化学习方法，采用基于表征、任务难度和数据来源的自适应重要性权重调整优势函数。对于缺乏人口标签的临床数据，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体

Result: 在7个临床诊断数据集上的实验表明，FairGRPO将预测公平性提高了27.2%，同时F1分数提升了12.49%。训练动态分析显示FairGRPO在优化过程中持续改善公平性

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI中的公平性问题，并基于该方法发布了FairMedGemma-4B模型，在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了跨人口群体的差异

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试上的实验验证了理论，并展示了思想通信在协作中的优势。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了利用隐藏世界的潜力，因为许多挑战仅通过表面观察无法解决，无论计算或数据规模如何。

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

Conclusion: 基于可解释性技术(SHAP)的特征选择被证明是一种有效方法，有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

TL;DR: FINDER是一个用于分析噪声数据集的分类框架，通过随机特征和KLE分解来处理低信噪比、小样本等挑战性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，需要专门的方法来处理这些挑战。

Method: 将经验数据集视为随机场的实现，映射到希尔伯特空间，使用Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开分解随机特征为可计算不可约分量，通过特征分解进行分类。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病分期分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺的科学领域取得了最先进的突破性成果。

Conclusion: FINDER在噪声数据集上表现优异，但需要讨论其适用条件、失败模式和局限性。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

TL;DR: 首次分析了Muon优化器中不精确正交化更新的理论性能，揭示了近似精度与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都基于计算上不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在线性最小化Oracle框架下，引入加性误差模型来捕捉实际近似方案的不精确性，分析不精确正交化更新的性能界限。

Result: 发现不精确性与最优步长和动量存在基本耦合：较低oracle精度需要更小步长但更大动量参数，近似精度成为必须与学习计划共同调优的关键参数。

Conclusion: 将近似过程从实现细节提升为关键参数，NanoGPT实验证实了预测的耦合关系，最优学习率随近似精度变化而明显偏移。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

Conclusion: f-DP在去中心化隐私计算中具有优势，能够更准确地量化隐私预算并提高算法效用。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

TL;DR: 本文分析了持续学习中线性回归的任务排序问题，重点研究了贪婪最大化任务间差异性的排序方法，并与随机排序进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究任务排序在持续学习中的影响，特别是贪婪最大化任务间差异性的排序方法，这在先前工作中虽有提及但仍存在许多未解问题。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法文献中的工具，形式化贪婪排序方法，并建立几何和代数直觉。在线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务上进行实证分析，并在高秩回归设置下进行理论分析。

Result: 实证表明贪婪排序在平均损失收敛速度上优于随机排序。理论分析显示：在高秩设置下，贪婪排序与随机排序有相似的损失边界；但在一般秩设置下，单次贪婪排序可能失败，而允许重复的贪婪排序收敛速度为O(1/³√k)。

Conclusion: 揭示了贪婪排序和随机排序内部及之间的细微差别，为持续学习中的任务排序策略提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒RL方法依赖对称结构，无法捕捉市场影响的定向特性，导致训练与部署环境不匹配时性能下降。

Method: 开发椭圆不确定性集合，建立隐式和显式闭式解来计算最坏情况不确定性，实现高效鲁棒策略评估。

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务中，该方法获得更高的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的RL提供了更忠实和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶优化方法存在梯度估计偏差问题，除非扰动步长趋近于零，否则大多数梯度估计器都存在固有偏差，这限制了优化性能。

Method: 通过将方向导数重新定义为伸缩级数，并从精心设计的分布中采样，构建了一族无偏梯度估计器，同时保持有利的方差特性。

Conclusion: 在合成任务和语言模型微调上的实验证实，该方法相比标准方法具有更高的准确性和收敛性。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究两点零阶梯度估计器，发现当扰动步长趋于零时，最小化估计器渐近方差的扰动分布可以与真实梯度方向对齐，而非保持固定长度。提出了方向对齐扰动方案，在理论和实验上均优于传统方法。

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度的随机扰动，但忽略了扰动方向与梯度对齐可能带来的优势。本文旨在探索这种方向对齐扰动的潜力，以提升梯度估计的精度。

Method: 将问题建模为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出了方向对齐扰动方案，该方案能自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度。同时分析了使用δ-无偏随机扰动的随机梯度下降收敛性。

Result: 理论分析表明方向对齐扰动能最小化梯度估计器的渐近方差。在合成问题和实际任务上的实验验证表明，方向对齐扰动方案在特定条件下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 方向对齐的随机扰动相比固定长度扰动具有明显优势，能够提供更精确的梯度估计，为优化算法设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声，在所有数据维度上均匀分布，忽略了输入和数据维度的异质性，限制了鲁棒性认证的有效性。

Method: 开发了UCAN框架，通过三个示例性噪声参数生成器优化调整不同数据维度的各向异性噪声参数，支持多种噪声分布和不同ℓp范数的认证鲁棒性。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，UCAN相比现有最先进方法在大认证半径下认证精度提升高达182.6%。

Conclusion: UCAN通过各向异性噪声显著提升了随机平滑方法的认证对抗鲁棒性，为机器学习模型提供了更有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了时间序列预测中的"长序列信息增益假设"，发现适当截断历史数据反而能提高预测精度，提出了AMRC方法通过动态掩码损失和表示一致性约束来抑制冗余特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型基于"长序列信息增益假设"，但该假设存在固有局限性。研究发现现有模型在训练中学习大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），损害了有效信号提取能力。

Method: 提出AMRC方法，包含两个核心组件：1）动态掩码损失，自适应识别高区分度时间片段指导梯度下降；2）表示一致性约束，稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC有效抑制了冗余特征学习，同时显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时间建模中的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

TL;DR: 本文提出推理即填充和多重标记熵解码两种方法，充分利用掩码扩散语言模型的训练优势，在推理和后训练中实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型在数学和编程任务中，任意顺序解码算法表现不佳，标准多重标记解码会显著降低性能。需要找到方法充分利用MDLMs的额外计算能力。

Method: 1. 推理即填充：使用MDLMs填充推理模板，区分推理和答案标记，实现答案不确定性测量和早期退出；2. 多重标记熵解码：基于条件熵的自适应采样器，减少并行解码位置时的错误。

Result: 在GSM8k上，对LLaDA-8B Base进行后验推理轨迹微调，性能提升与人工编写推理轨迹微调相当；MED方法在保持性能的同时减少2.7倍步骤。

Conclusion: MDLMs的训练和计算能力为推理和后训练方法开辟了新途径，证明其额外计算成本是合理的。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

TL;DR: 使用监督学习和决策树分类器在CAD建模的平面图中分析RFID RSSI数据，实现12个实验室区域的定位推断，总体准确率34.2%，部分区域F1分数超过0.40，但在低信号区域分类效果较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID跟踪在国防资产存储中具有应用潜力，但传感器特异性差（易受远程检测、欺骗和伪造攻击）可能导致错误检测和安全事件，需要开发可靠的定位分类方法。

Method: 采用监督学习模拟，使用真实的RSSI数据和决策树分类器，在CAD建模的平面图中对12个实验室区域进行分类，处理类别不平衡问题，使用分层子采样和类别权重。

Result: 模型在5000个平衡观测值上训练，总体准确率34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类，即使使用类别权重。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可在实际模拟中应用于区域级异常检测或错位监控，但在低覆盖和低信号区域的可靠分类性能可通过改进天线布局或增加传感器及多模态传感器融合来提升。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在单轮任务中表现出色，但在复杂多步任务中面临挑战。基于群体的RL算法如GRPO仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，导致训练不稳定和次优策略。

Method: 提出SALT框架，从相同提示的轨迹构建图，量化每个步骤的质量并相应分配优势。该框架作为即插即用模块，无需修改滚动过程且计算开销极小。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT在不同模型大小下均能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: SALT通过细粒度优势分配有效解决了基于群体RL算法的训练不稳定问题，为复杂多步任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理广告竞价中的延迟效应、累积影响和用户异质性，为在线广告平台提供了理论保证的个性化竞价策略解决方案。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model

with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究核心加密资产流动性和波动率代理是否产生溢出效应来预测市场整体风险，通过多层统计框架发现显著的格兰杰因果关系和中等程度的样本外预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究加密资产市场的流动性和波动率特征是否能够预测市场整体风险，为风险管理提供依据。

Method: 集成三层统计框架：核心流动性与收益互动、主成分关系、波动率因子投影，辅以VAR脉冲响应、HAR-X模型和防泄漏机器学习协议。

Result: 使用2021-2025年74种资产的1462个日度数据，发现跨层的统计显著格兰杰因果关系和中等样本外预测准确性。

Conclusion: 核心加密资产的流动性和波动率代理确实产生溢出效应，能够预测市场整体风险，具有风险管理应用价值。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

TL;DR: 提出了耦合Transformer自编码器（CTAE），用于从多脑区同时记录中分离共享和区域特定的神经动态，解决了现有方法忽略时间结构或无法区分共享与私有信号的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么忽视时间结构，要么局限于单脑区、假设线性关系或混淆共享与私有信号，无法有效处理多脑区同时记录中的复杂神经动态。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器和解码器捕获长程神经动态，将每个脑区的潜在空间显式划分为正交的共享和私有子空间。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集（运动皮层和感觉区域）上验证，CTAE提取的表征能更好地解码行为变量，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CTAE提供了一个统一框架，能同时处理非平稳非线性动态并分离共享与区域特定结构，在多脑区神经记录分析中表现优异。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: ShapeX是一个创新的时间序列分类解释框架，通过形状片段分割和Shapley值评估，提供比现有方法更精确和因果忠实度的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗和金融等高风险应用中，时间序列分类模型的透明度至关重要。现有后验解释方法主要关注时间步级特征归因，忽略了分类结果主要由关键形状片段驱动的基本先验。

Method: ShapeX框架包含形状片段描述与检测(SDD)框架，学习分类必需的各种形状片段，并使用Shapley值评估这些片段的显著性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，ShapeX在识别最相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精度和因果忠实度。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过形状片段驱动的分割和显著性评估，能够产生揭示因果关系而非仅仅是相关性的解释，得益于形状片段的原子性特性。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于MentalRoBERTa的分层双头神经网络，用于社交媒体自杀风险四级别分类，结合CORAL头保持序数关系和分类头实现灵活区分，通过组合损失函数解决类别不平衡和过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动检测系统面临类别严重不平衡、发帖模式的时间复杂性以及风险级别既有序数性又有分类性的双重挑战。

Method: 使用MentalRoBERTa为基础，构建分层双头神经网络：CORAL头保持风险级别序数关系，标准分类头实现灵活分类；3层Transformer编码器建模时间依赖，显式时间间隔嵌入捕获发帖动态；组合损失函数(0.5 CORAL + 0.3 交叉熵 + 0.2 Focal Loss)；冻结前6层MentalRoBERTa并使用混合精度训练。

Result: 使用5折分层交叉验证，以宏F1分数为主要评估指标进行模型评估。

Conclusion: 该模型有效解决了社交媒体自杀风险检测中的多重挑战，通过双头架构同时处理序数和分类特性，组合损失函数平衡不同优化目标，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于博弈论强化学习的因果发现框架，通过DDQN智能体与强基线方法(GES/GraN-DAG)竞争，实现理论保证与可扩展性的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在理论与实践的鸿沟：经验性能好的方法缺乏有限样本保证，而理论严谨的方法无法扩展到大规模图。

Method: 使用DDQN强化学习智能体与基线方法竞争，始终从对手解进行热启动，确保学习到的图不会比对手差。

Result: 在合成SEM(30节点)上误差概率随样本量衰减，与理论匹配；在真实数据集(Sachs、Asia等)上持续改进GES和GraN-DAG，可扩展到Hepar2(70节点)、Dream(100节点)、Andes(220节点)等大规模图。

Conclusion: 建立了同时具备可证明一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性的RL因果发现算法新类别，统一了经验性能与严格有限样本理论。

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的维度加权方案，并将其整合到KNN分类器中，通过加权Minkowski距离改进了传统KNN在模式分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多维样本的模式分类中，基于权重的维度距离度量对反映样本间相似度至关重要。虽然欧氏距离被广泛使用，但仍存在诸多问题需要解决。

Method: 开发了新的维度加权方案，将其整合到KNN分类器中，使用加权Minkowski距离，并在合成和真实数据集上进行模式分类实验。

Result: 在相同实验设置下，该方法比传统KNN表现更好，特别是在基因表达数据集上，分类准确率显著提升约10%，在不同k值的交叉验证实验中均表现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法通过调节包含k个参考样本区域的大小和形状，实现了对高维小样本数据集中最近邻的有意义选择，是传统KNN分类器的重要推广。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全解耦的训练策略来解决原型自监督学习中的原型坍缩问题，通过独立的在线EM风格过程更新原型，无需显式正则化即可获得多样化的原型和更好的下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在部分原型坍缩问题，多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这破坏了提供多样化目标的核心目的，导致实践者需要过度参数化原型集或添加临时正则化器。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器分别在不同目标下学习。具体将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用独立于编码器损失的在线EM风格过程更新。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型坍缩，无需显式正则化即可获得一致多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型坍缩的根本原因，提供了一种更有效的原型自监督学习方法。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

*Arian Prabowo,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)表现不佳，原因在于简单套用NLP/CV范式。时间序列数据缺乏自然概念，需要基于不变性原则构建数据集来确保表示完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型表现与轻量监督基线甚至经典模型相当，需要分析根本原因并找到改进方向。

Method: 提出从机会主义的数据聚合转向原则性设计，构建系统覆盖时间语义不变性空间的数据集。

Result: 识别出时间序列数据缺乏自然概念的根本问题，传统网络爬取范式在时间序列领域失效。

Conclusion: 只有通过确保不变性覆盖来实现表示完整性，时间序列基础模型才能实现真正的泛化、推理和涌现行为。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过多层图扩散模型发现，阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白的传播受结构和功能连接网络的共同约束，但两者贡献存在区域不对称性，且在不同疾病阶段主导地位会发生变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经影像学证据显示病理性tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累，但结构和功能连接如何相互作用影响tau传播尚不清楚。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型研究结构和功能连接的相互作用。

Result: FC主要在皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层驱动tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域作用更大。SC和FC的相对主导地位随疾病进展而变化，早期AD以FC为主，晚期以SC为主。

Conclusion: 结构和功能连接网络共同约束tau传播，其相对贡献具有区域特异性和疾病阶段依赖性，并与AD相关基因表达模式高度一致。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

TL;DR: 提出ADP-VRSGP方法，通过自适应调整噪声方差和学习率，结合历史梯度的渐进融合策略，在保证节点级个性化隐私的同时提升去中心化学习的训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定方差噪声方法会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要一种能动态调整噪声和学习率的自适应差分隐私方法。

Method: 使用步进衰减调度动态调整噪声方差和学习率，引入渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度，结合去中心化push-sum和聚合技术。

Result: 理论分析证明方法具有鲁棒收敛性，实验验证在多种场景下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP能有效解决隐私保护去中心化学习的挑战，在保证隐私的同时显著提升训练稳定性和速度。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

Motivation: 现有神经方法在处理大规模TSP时面临内存限制、初始解质量差和全局引导不足的问题。

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超路径引导的邻域搜索有效解决了大规模TSP问题，提供了更高效的优化策略。

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习可验证奖励方法虽然能有效训练模型，但忽略了不同任务的重要性差异，需要更直接地整合人类价值信号。

Method: RLEV扩展了RLVR框架，在奖励函数中直接融入人类定义的价值信号，使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试式数据，并通过价值加权梯度放大机制学习价值敏感的终止策略。

Result: RLEV在多种RL算法和模型规模下持续优于仅基于正确性的基线方法，不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学会了根据提示价值调整响应长度的终止策略。

Conclusion: RLEV通过优化明确的效用函数，为将LLM与人类优先事项对齐提供了实用路径，即使在噪声价值信号下也保持稳健。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用提供了有效的风险感知约束强化学习解决方案，具有良好的收敛性和实用性。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种可复制性的松弛定义：点态可复制性、近似可复制性和半可复制性，并在这些定义下实现了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性在简单任务（如阈值学习）中不可实现，作者希望探索在何种近似可复制性定义下学习是可行的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性松弛：(1)点态可复制性：对固定输入保持一致性；(2)近似可复制性：对分布的大部分分类一致；(3)半可复制性：完全可复制但可使用共享未标记样本。

Result: 对于常数可复制性参数，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：前两种方法使用Θ(d/α²)样本即可实现，第三种需要Θ(d²/α²)标记样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当的可复制性松弛，可以在不显著增加样本复杂度的情况下实现稳定的学习算法。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

### [151] [Assessing the Feasibility of Early Cancer Detection Using Routine Laboratory Data: An Evaluation of Machine Learning Approaches on an Imbalanced Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20209)
*Shumin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列的常规实验室数据开发癌症风险分类模型，通过126种分析流程比较发现，虽然存在可检测的癌症信号，但由于信号太弱且与正常衰老或炎症混淆，无法实现可靠的临床分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发低成本、易获取的犬类癌症早期筛查工具，解决个体生物标志物非特异性和筛查人群中严重类别不平衡的问题。

Method: 使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列数据，系统比较126种分析流程，包括不同机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，采用患者级数据分区防止数据泄露。

Result: 最佳模型（带类别加权的逻辑回归分类器）显示中等排序能力（AUROC=0.815），但临床分类性能差（F1分数=0.25，阳性预测值=0.15），阴性预测值高（0.98）但召回率不足（0.79）。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在的癌症信号太弱且易混淆，无法实现可靠的临床鉴别，需要整合多模态数据源才能取得有意义的进展。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

TL;DR: 提出CO-PFL算法，通过动态评估客户端贡献来解决个性化联邦学习中的数据异质性问题，采用双子空间分析和参数级个性化机制，显著提升个性化性能和收敛稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异质性下表现不佳，其基于数据量或启发式的聚合方法无法准确评估客户端更新的实际效用和可靠性，导致次优个性化和聚合偏差。

Method: CO-PFL通过分析梯度方向差异和预测偏差来联合评估客户端贡献，利用梯度和数据子空间信息进行双子空间分析，并结合参数级个性化机制和掩码感知动量优化。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，CO-PFL在个性化精度、鲁棒性、可扩展性和收敛稳定性方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CO-PFL通过动态贡献评估和参数级个性化，有效缓解了聚合偏差，增强了全局协调，提升了本地性能，为异构数据环境下的联邦学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Fair-SMW算法，通过拉格朗日方法和Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury恒等式重新制定约束优化问题，提高谱聚类算法的效率，在保持公平性的同时显著减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将群体公平性（平衡）纳入谱聚类算法的研究导致计算时间过长，需要改进算法效率。

Method: 使用拉格朗日方法和SMW恒等式重新制定约束优化问题，提出Fair-SMW算法，采用三种不同的拉普拉斯矩阵变体生成多个算法版本。

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet、Deezer和German等真实网络数据集上测试，计算时间比现有最优算法快两倍，同时能够实现两倍的平衡度。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平聚类质量的同时，显著提高了计算效率，为解决算法偏见提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

Motivation: 现实世界时序预测任务中，类别信息对于捕捉数据内在模式至关重要，但传统注意力机制未能充分利用此类信息。

Method: 扩展传统QKV注意力框架为QKCV，引入静态类别嵌入C作为额外输入，可作为即插即用模块集成到多种注意力模型中。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上显著提升了Vanilla Transformer、Informer、PatchTST、TFT等模型的预测精度，并在微调单变量时序基础模型时仅需更新静态嵌入C，计算开销小且性能优越。

Conclusion: QKCV注意力机制通过有效整合类别信息，不仅提升了时序预测性能，还提供了高效微调方案，具有良好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

TL;DR: 提出MetaVD方法，通过贝叶斯元学习预测客户端相关的dropout率，解决联邦学习中非IID数据导致的模型过拟合和发散问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在非IID数据下存在模型过拟合和本地模型发散的问题，需要改进模型个性化能力。

Method: 使用超网络预测客户端相关的dropout率，通过条件dropout后验实现元学习的后验适应和贝叶斯联邦学习的后验聚合。

Result: 在稀疏和非IID联邦学习数据集上，MetaVD表现出优秀的分类准确性和不确定性校准性能，特别是在分布外客户端上。

Conclusion: MetaVD能有效压缩本地模型参数，减轻模型过拟合并降低通信成本，为联邦学习提供了有效的个性化解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在理论和实验上都表现出色，为多目标强化学习提供了可证明收敛且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LKM的自知识蒸馏方法，能够显著提升图神经网络在分子属性预测中的准确性，同时几乎不增加计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络是目前预测分子属性的最有效方法，但需要更高的准确性。虽然增加模型复杂度可以提高准确性，但会显著增加计算成本和内存需求。

Method: 开发了层到层知识混合(LKM)方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，改善局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: 在三个不同GNN架构(DimeNet++、MXMNet、PAMNet)和量子化学属性数据集(QM9、MD17和Chignolin)上的评估显示，LKM将量子化学和生物物理属性预测的平均绝对误差分别降低了9.8%、45.3%和22.9%。

Conclusion: LKM方法有潜力在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学属性预测中的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了选择性分类差距的概念，将理想oracle性能与实际选择性分类器性能之间的差距分解为五个来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实现/分布漂移导致的松弛。研究发现单调后校准对缩小这一差距作用有限，需要能够重新排序预测的评分机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择性分类器通过在不确定的输入上弃权来提高模型可靠性，但现有方法很少能达到完美排序oracle的性能。本文旨在形式化这一性能差距并分析其来源。

Method: 提出了选择性分类差距的有限样本分解框架，将差距分解为五个误差源，并在合成数据和真实视觉、语言基准上通过受控实验验证分解结果。

Result: 验证发现：(i)贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量会造成显著差距；(ii)只有更丰富的特征感知校准器能有效改进评分排序；(iii)数据漂移引入了需要分布鲁棒训练的松弛项。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了定量误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助实践者构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

Motivation: 现有方法在特定异构场景下性能不足，缺乏对不同异构场景的鲁棒性。实验发现共享统计信息有助于缓解异构性。

Conclusion: FedGPS通过统计分布和梯度信息的协同整合，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，具有优异的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策准则，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性来指导行为基础模型进行任务推断，在少量交互中识别和优化未见过的奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行为基础模型需要计算推理数据集上的奖励，这要么需要奖励函数的函数形式，要么需要大量标注工作。本文旨在通过与环境交互来解决任务推断问题。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM乐观决策准则，直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，引导BFMs进行任务推断的数据收集。该方法与线性bandits的上置信界算法有直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的BFMs能够在少量episode中识别和优化未见过的奖励函数，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为行为基础模型提供了一种高效的任务推断方法，通过乐观决策准则在少量交互中实现零样本强化学习。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个基准框架，用于系统性地测量LLM代理利用测试用例的倾向，通过在现有基准任务中引入自然语言规范与单元测试之间的直接冲突来创建"不可能"任务变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找和利用"捷径"完成任务，这给可靠评估和部署大型语言模型带来了显著风险，例如删除失败测试而非修复底层错误，这会破坏基准结果的有效性和实际部署的可靠性。

Method: 通过创建现有基准（如LiveCodeBench和SWE-bench）的"不可能"变体任务，引入自然语言规范与单元测试之间的直接冲突，测量代理在这些不可能任务上的通过率（作弊率）。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂运算符重载等更细粒度的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环如何影响作弊率，并提供了经过验证的欺骗性解决方案测试平台。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench作为一个实用框架，不仅用于评估，还可用于研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具，有助于构建更健壮可靠的LLM系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的链式思维提示和Best-of-N选择在复杂数学问题解决中无法捕捉分支和探索性质，需要研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能改进数学推理。

Method: 提出自适应算法最大化过程奖励模型分数，使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct及其相关PRM作为案例研究，在23个数学问题上评估PRM引导的树搜索方法。

Result: PRM引导的树搜索相比BoN无统计显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和束搜索表现最佳；PRM对状态值近似差且可靠性随推理深度下降；PRM分布外泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠PRM分数依赖过强，需要不同的奖励建模方法才能有效提升LLMs的数学推理能力。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SynTSBench，一种基于合成数据的评估框架，用于系统评估时间序列预测模型的基本建模能力，通过可编程特征配置来量化模型在不同时间模式、数据异常和理论最优基准下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在标准基准数据集上表现良好，但在实际应用中性能不稳定，主要由于模型的黑盒性质和现有评估框架的局限性，无法清晰量化不同模型在特定预测场景中的优缺点。

Method: 通过合成数据驱动的评估范式，建立可解释的评估系统，包括三个核心分析维度：时间特征分解与能力映射、数据异常下的鲁棒性分析、理论最优基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，当前深度学习模型并非在所有类型的时间特征上都接近最优基准，揭示了模型在不同模式学习能力上的局限性。

Conclusion: SynTSBench提供了一个系统化的评估框架，能够更全面地揭示时间序列预测模型的真实能力，为模型选择和优化提供量化依据。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于KAN的协作模型(KCM)来解决大-小模型协作中的精度下降、灾难性遗忘和幻觉问题，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大-小模型协作框架中存在的精度显著下降、灾难性遗忘加剧以及小模型知识引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 使用KAN(可解释神经网络)作为协作模型，替代传统MLP，在语言、视觉和跨模态任务中部署大-小模型协作系统。

Result: 相比纯大模型方法，KCM协作框架显著减少大模型推理调用次数，保持接近的任务精度；相比MLP协作模型，KCM显著缓解灾难性遗忘，提升长尾数据精度。

Conclusion: KCM在所有指标上都优于基于MLP的小协作模型，为资源受限环境下的模型协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Result: CS-4k能够区分最先进LLM的能力层级，在CS-50k上训练的7B模型超越许多大型专有系统如GPT-4.1、GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro

Conclusion: 让AI模型成为更好的研究助手更依赖于领域对齐的高质量数据训练，而非预训练规模或通用基准性能

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试上，该方法在图形泛化任务中持续优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: 提出的IRM-free方法能够有效捕获因果子图，在分布偏移下实现更好的图神经网络泛化性能

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net作为无需数据增强、可解释且可部署的深度学习模型，在脑肿瘤诊断中具有可靠的临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvDec是一种混合架构，通过倒置解码器实现时间编码和变量级解码的分离，在保持PatchTST时间建模优势的同时有效捕捉变量间依赖关系，在高维数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：通道独立方法如PatchTST擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法如iTransformer牺牲了时间编码。需要一种能同时建模时间模式和跨变量依赖的解决方案。

Method: 提出InvDec架构：结合基于patch的时间编码器和在变量维度上通过变量级自注意力操作的倒置解码器。引入延迟变量嵌入在时间编码后丰富变量特定表示，保持时间特征完整性。采用自适应残差融合机制动态平衡时间和变量信息。

Result: 在7个基准测试上验证，InvDec-PatchTST在高维数据集上表现显著提升：Electricity（321变量）MSE降低20.9%，Weather提升4.3%，Traffic提升2.7%。在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力。消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: InvDec通过时间编码和变量解码的分离，在高维多变量时间序列预测中实现了更好的性能。分析表明其优势随数据集维度增加而增长，证实了跨变量建模在变量数量增加时的重要性。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

Motivation: 现实世界中的隐私保护需求往往涉及多个敏感属性且具有动态性，现有的单属性遗忘方法无法同时处理多个遗忘请求和适应动态需求。

Method: 将多属性遗忘过程分为嵌入校准（从用户嵌入中移除特定属性信息）和灵活组合（将多个嵌入组合成单一嵌入）两个步骤，将遗忘过程建模为互信息最小化问题。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集和三种代表性推荐模型上的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: LEGO框架能够有效解决多属性遗忘问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Conclusion: 通过控制图像生成和域适应策略，合成图像可以有效补充真实数据，提升关键应用中视觉模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性路由框架能够高效结合快速奖励模型和强大LLM法官的优势，为在线RLHF提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法具有更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 在协调过程中考虑不确定性能有效提升层次预测的性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

TL;DR: 提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过RBP指标衡量正确token在预测中的排名概率，补充了传统交叉熵指标的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序，而相对排序在语言模型（如贪婪采样场景）中至关重要。

Method: 提出相对概率（RBP）指标，量化正确token在top预测中的排名概率，并基于此建立相对缩放定律，描述RBP如何随模型规模增加而改善。在四个数据集和四个模型家族上进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 通过跨越五个数量级的实验，证明了相对缩放定律的鲁棒性和准确性。该定律能够更深入地解释涌现现象，并有助于寻找缩放定律的基本理论。

Conclusion: 相对缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大规模语言模型的缩放提供了更完整的理解，对实际开发和理论探索都具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接对齐算法如DPO使用监督学习而非两阶段RLHF，但当真实奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时会出现设定错误问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 研究DPO的统计估计问题，分析两阶段RLHF的局部行为，提出AuxDPO方法在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量，以更接近RLHF解决方案。

Result: 在示例赌博机设置和LLM对齐任务中，AuxDPO表现出优于DPO的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO能够缓解DPO中的设定错误问题，提供更接近RLHF解决方案的对齐方法。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了现实应用中事件标记分布高度不平衡的问题，其中一些标记频繁出现而其他标记则很罕见，这种不平衡对下一个事件的预测性能（尤其是稀有标记事件）构成了重大挑战。

Method: 提出阈值方法学习阈值来调整由标记先验概率归一化的标记概率，以优化标记预测；开发新的神经MTPP模型支持有效时间采样和标记概率估计，无需计算昂贵的数值不当积分。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案通过阈值调整和新的神经MTPP模型，有效解决了事件标记分布不平衡问题，显著提升了稀有标记事件的预测性能。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code
is available at https://github.com/undes1red/IFNMTPP.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在现实系统中部署时会产生有毒或有偏见的输出，而参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性地使用修复数据，但现有数据选择方法在大型生成模型行为修复中的效果尚不明确。

Method: 评估了五种样本选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、基于梯度范数的选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)以及提出的语义感知优先采样(SAPS)，通过毒性减少、困惑度和三个复合指标来评估修复效果。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率方面达到最佳平衡，能以更少数据实现相当或更好的修复结果；随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍然有效；高开销方法如CCS和GraNd收益有限。

Conclusion: 样本选择应被视为修复流程中的可调组件，基于选择的修复是维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物相互作用预测方法依赖孤立药物表示，无法显式建模原子级跨分子交互，限制了在不同分子复杂度和DDI类型分布下的有效性

Method: 构建整合药物对原子结构的联合图，引入结构一致性模块迭代细化节点特征，同时保持全局结构上下文，有效学习局部和全局交互模式

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MolBridge在长尾和归纳场景下均优于现有最先进基线，实现卓越性能

Conclusion: 细粒度图细化方法显著提高了DDI事件预测的准确性、稳健性和机制可解释性，为网络挖掘和内容分析贡献了基于图的药物相互作用网络分析方法

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing
drug-drug interaction networks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用图神经网络建模网球比赛中的不可传递关系，发现博彩公司在处理高不可传递性比赛时存在市场低效，通过选择性投注可获得3.26%的投资回报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网球比赛中常见的不可传递关系（如A胜B、B胜C但C胜A）在现有预测方法中很少被考虑，博彩公司在处理这类比赛时表现不佳，存在市场低效。

Method: 使用图神经网络方法，将球员作为节点，历史比赛结果作为有向边，构建时序有向图来显式建模不可传递关系。

Result: 模型在65.7%的准确率和0.215的Brier分数下，对高不可传递性比赛进行选择性投注，在1903次投注中获得了3.26%的投资回报率。

Conclusion: 图神经网络方法能够有效捕捉不可传递关系中的动态关系，成功利用了博彩市场在处理不可传递比赛时的低效性。

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的激增和法律压力增加，水印技术对确保内容真实性和归属至关重要。然而，水印伪造（从真实内容窃取水印并应用于恶意内容）这一场景尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 1. 引入偏好模型评估图像是否含水印，仅使用程序生成的图像训练；2. 通过反向传播优化输入图像来移除和伪造水印，无需了解水印模型细节；3. 在多种后处理图像水印模型上评估该方法。

Result: 该方法能有效伪造水印，仅需单张水印图像且无需水印模型知识，比相关工作提出的攻击更简单实用。

Conclusion: 当前水印方法的安全性受到质疑，提出的攻击方法简单有效，暴露了现有水印技术的脆弱性。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督微调方法依赖预测一致性或预定义置信度阈值，导致模型偏差和超参数敏感性，需要更有效的伪标签分配策略。

Method: Bi-CoG方法同时利用模型间和模型内一致性，结合错误感知动态伪标签分配策略，生成高质量低偏差的伪标签。

Result: 在14个数据集上的实验表明，Bi-CoG能持续显著提升现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: Bi-CoG是一种简单有效的即插即用方法，通过双一致性引导和动态伪标签分配，有效解决了半监督微调中的关键问题。

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出Hurdle-IMDL框架解决遥感降雨反演中的标签不平衡问题，通过分解零膨胀和长尾分布，有效改善对强降雨的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在定量遥感中受限于标签分布不平衡，传统训练模型偏向常见样本，导致对罕见样本（如强降雨）的检索性能下降。

Method: 采用分治策略：使用hurdle模型处理零膨胀（非降雨样本占主导），提出IMDL方法处理长尾分布（轻降雨样本远多于强降雨样本），将学习目标转换为无偏理想逆模型。

Result: 通过统计指标和案例研究验证，Hurdle-IMDL在华东地区降雨反演中优于传统、代价敏感、生成和多任务学习方法，显著改善了强到极端降雨的检索性能。

Conclusion: IMDL为解决环境变量分布不平衡提供了通用方法，能够增强对罕见但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

TL;DR: SheafAlign是一个基于层理论的去中心化多模态对齐框架，通过多比较空间替代单空间对齐，解决了传统方法需要所有模态相互冗余的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对齐方法假设所有模态间存在相互冗余，这在现实分布式场景中不成立。需要一种能够处理非完全冗余模态的对齐方法。

Method: 使用层结构建模成对模态关系，采用去中心化对比学习目标进行训练，在多比较空间中实现对齐。

Result: 在多模态传感数据集上表现出优异的零样本泛化能力、跨模态对齐性能和模态缺失鲁棒性，通信成本比现有最优方法降低50%。

Conclusion: SheafAlign框架成功克服了传统方法的局限性，无需所有模态相互冗余，同时保留了共享和独特信息，在分布式场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架为零样本RL研究提供了原则性基础，为开发更通用智能体指明了清晰路径，有助于推动该领域的系统化发展。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Method: 研究了七种不同的重连策略，并将局部和全局图属性的变化与节点分类准确率相关联。

Result: 结果显示成功的重连方法倾向于保留局部结构，同时允许全局连接的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重连策略提供了新见解，弥合了图理论与实际GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Result: 在多种推理问题上超越现有最先进方法，能够泛化到更大更复杂的问题。

Conclusion: 通过组合子问题能量景观的方法有效提升了推理模型的泛化能力，为解决复杂推理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

TL;DR: 本文对随机梯度下降(SGD)在期望平滑性(ES)条件下的收敛性进行了系统分析，改进了ES条件的解释和常数设置，推导了全梯度范数期望的界，并证明了多种步长调度下的O(1/K)收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖于过强（有界方差）或过粗糙（均匀噪声）的假设，期望平滑性条件提供了更灵活的替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 通过精炼期望平滑性条件及其解释，推导全梯度范数期望的界，并分析多种步长调度策略下的收敛性。

Result: 证明了SGD在期望平滑性条件下具有O(1/K)的收敛率，并给出了显式的残差误差表达式，统一并扩展了近期相关研究。

Conclusion: 该分析为SGD在更一般条件下的收敛性提供了自包含的理论框架，统一了近期研究进展，并提供了详细的证明过程。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在有限计算预算下代码生成任务的检索设计，比较了不同检索配置在代码补全和bug定位任务中的表现，发现BM25+词级分割在PL-PL任务中最有效，而专用密集编码器在NL-PL任务中表现更好但延迟高100倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在现实计算预算下代码导向生成任务的检索设计，为构建高效的代码RAG系统提供基于证据的建议。

Method: 使用Long Code Arena中的代码补全和bug定位任务，系统比较不同检索配置在三个维度上的表现：分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度。

Result: BM25+词级分割在PL-PL任务中表现最佳且速度快10倍；专用密集编码器在NL-PL任务中表现更好但延迟高100倍；32-64行分块在小预算下效果最好；基于行的分块与语法感知分割效果相当；检索延迟差异可达200倍。

Conclusion: 为代码导向RAG系统提供了基于任务需求、模型约束和计算效率的具体实施建议，强调BM25+词级分割在质量-延迟权衡方面的优势。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

*Yang Han,Pengyu Wang,Kai Yu,Xin Chen,Lu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MS-BART是一个统一建模框架，通过大规模预训练将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表中，解决了质谱数据稀缺问题，并在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质谱在分子识别中至关重要，但由于标注谱图稀缺，从质谱数据解析结构仍具挑战性。现有的大规模预训练方法难以直接应用于质谱领域，因为原始谱信号的复杂性和异质性。

Method: 提出MS-BART框架，将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表，通过大规模预训练在可靠计算的指纹-分子数据集上进行跨模态学习。采用多任务预训练目标，结合去噪和翻译任务优化。通过MIST生成指纹预测进行微调，并引入化学反馈机制减少分子幻觉。

Result: 在MassSpecGym和NPLIB1基准测试中，MS-BART在5/12关键指标上达到SOTA性能，比基于扩散的竞争方法快一个数量级。消融研究系统验证了模型的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MS-BART通过统一建模框架和大规模预训练有效解决了质谱数据稀缺问题，结合化学反馈机制显著提升了分子结构解析的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

*Aki Rehn,Linzh Zhao,Mikko A. Heikkilä,Antti Honkela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：裁剪边界C和批量大小B。研究发现当前理论（强隐私需要更小的C）与实证结果（强隐私下更大的C表现更好）存在不匹配，并揭示了现有批量大小启发式方法在有限计算预算下无效，而累积DP噪声能更好解释批量大小选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前差分隐私迁移学习实践中，裁剪边界C和批量大小B的选择存在理论与实证的不一致，且现有启发式方法在有限计算预算下效果不佳，需要更深入理解这些超参数的影响机制。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化、将裁剪视为梯度重加权形式、以及检查累积DP噪声，研究在不同隐私约束和计算预算下C和B参数的选择策略。

Result: 发现强隐私约束下更大的C表现更好，与理论预期相反；在固定epochs的有限计算预算下，现有批量大小启发式方法无效，而累积DP噪声能更好预测批量大小选择效果；单一(C,B)设置在不同任务间会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 差分隐私迁移学习的超参数选择需要更细致的考虑，特别是裁剪边界和批量大小的选择应基于梯度分布特性和累积噪声分析，而非简单遵循现有启发式方法，这对实际部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

TL;DR: H-SPLID是一种通过显式分解显著和非显著特征到不同空间来学习显著特征表示的新算法，能够促进学习低维、任务相关的特征，并提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在特征学习中往往无法明确区分显著和非显著特征，导致模型可能学习到与任务无关的特征，影响模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 通过显式分解将显著和非显著特征分离到不同空间，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)建立输入与表示之间的关联，并证明预测偏差受显著子空间维度和HSIC值的上界约束。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实证评估表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入组件，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动表现出降低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID成功建立了鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系，通过维度压缩和信息保留来提升模型性能，为特征学习提供了新的理论框架和实践方法。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种公平感知生存建模方法(FASM)，旨在减轻生存分析中的算法偏见，特别是在组内和跨组风险排序方面，以乳腺癌预后为例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗领域的应用中，临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见可能被数据驱动模型延续甚至放大。在生存分析中，删失和时间动态性进一步增加了公平模型开发的复杂性。

Method: 提出了公平感知生存建模(FASM)框架，专门设计用于减轻算法偏见，关注组内和跨组风险排序的时间动态。使用乳腺癌预后作为代表性案例，并应用于SEER乳腺癌数据。

Result: FASM显著提高了公平性，同时保持了与不考虑公平性的生存模型相当的判别性能。时间分层评估显示FASM在10年时间范围内保持稳定的公平性，在随访中期观察到最大的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法能够开发既优先考虑准确性又注重公平性的生存模型，将公平性作为临床护理的核心原则推进。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

Conclusion: DiRecGNN框架有效解决了云服务监控中的实体推荐问题，通过注意力机制捕捉复杂依赖关系，在实际部署中获得了良好反馈。

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

TL;DR: 该论文推导了一个新的、紧致的、可处理的KLD下界作为JSD的函数，证明了最大化基于JSD的信息度量可以增加互信息的下界保证，为基于判别学习的互信息表示学习提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然互信息是表示学习中的基本统计依赖度量，但直接优化往往难以处理。许多方法转而最大化替代依赖度量（如JSD），但这些替代目标与互信息的关系缺乏理论理解。

Method: 推导了KLD作为JSD函数的紧致下界，并将其应用于联合分布和边缘分布，证明最大化JSD可以增加互信息的下界。通过训练二元分类器最小化交叉熵损失来实现JSD的变分下界。

Result: 实验表明该下界在互信息估计中具有紧致性，与最先进的神经估计器相比，能提供稳定、低方差的紧致下界估计，并在信息瓶颈框架中展示了实用价值。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于判别学习的互信息表示学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力的实证证据，证明了JSD最大化与互信息增加之间的理论联系。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

Result: 在真实数据上的实验显示，少数类F1分数相比竞争基线提高了11-35%。

Conclusion: GRACE框架能有效解决成瘾数据集中的类别不平衡问题，提升治疗场所预测性能。

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列中的极端事件（如洪水、热浪、医疗紧急事件）具有重要实际意义，但现有预测模型因数据不平衡和忽视中间事件信息而难以准确预测极端事件。

Method: 提出xTime框架，利用知识蒸馏从训练在较低稀有度事件上的模型转移信息，并引入专家混合(MoE)机制动态选择和融合不同稀有度级别的专家模型输出。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，xTime实现了持续的改进，极端事件的预测准确率从3%提升到78%。

Conclusion: xTime通过知识蒸馏和MoE机制有效解决了极端事件预测中的数据不平衡问题，显著提高了预测性能。

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中容易受到干扰，现有数据驱动方法在定位方面表现尚可，但在重建接收信号强度场方面效果不佳，主要受限于空间上下文信息不足。

Method: 使用混合贝叶斯专家混合框架，融合物理路径损耗模型（确保物理一致性）和卷积神经网络（利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应），通过对数线性池化进行融合，并采用拉普拉斯近似进行贝叶斯推断。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验表明，随着训练点数量的增加，定位精度提高且不确定性降低，不确定性主要集中在干扰源附近和城市峡谷区域。

Conclusion: 该混合框架能够有效提高GNSS干扰源定位精度并重建信号强度场，同时提供后验不确定性估计，特别适用于城市环境中的干扰检测。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的神经解码方法存在两个问题：简单的因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂的非因果模型虽然能泛化但难以实时应用。两者都依赖耗电的人工神经网络，难以集成到资源受限的现实系统中。

Method: Spikachu框架直接处理分箱的脉冲信号，将其投影到共享潜在空间中，通过适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取相关特征，然后整合这些潜在表示并解码生成行为预测。

Result: 在6只非人类灵长类动物的113个记录会话（总计43小时记录）上评估，该方法在单会话训练中优于因果基线模型，能耗降低2.26-418.81倍。扩展到多会话和多主体训练能进一步提升性能，并实现对新会话、主体和任务的少样本迁移。

Conclusion: Spikachu提供了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，其性能与最先进模型相当，同时能耗降低了数个数量级。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Result: 在仅1,000-2,500个神经元和少于1,000个训练样本的情况下，MEIcoder能重建高保真自然图像，MEIs是性能提升的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于半导体制造异常预测的两阶段框架，包含两种方法：基于N-BEATS的单变量预测和基于图神经网络的多变量关系建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造过程复杂且精度要求高，传统异常检测方法面临高维数据、类别不平衡和变量间复杂依赖关系的挑战，需要从异常检测向异常预测发展以实现实时过程校正。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先在无异常数据集上训练预测模型，然后对未见时间序列进行预测并与训练信号预测比较，偏差超过阈值则标记为异常。使用N-BEATS和GNN两种预测模型。

Result: 两种模型在20个时间点内表现出强预测性能，在50个时间点内保持稳定异常预测。GNN模型始终优于N-BEATS模型，且需要更少的可训练参数和计算成本。

Conclusion: GNN模型是制造环境中在线异常预测的有前景解决方案，能够有效捕获变量间关系并实现高效预测。

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速无微调的LLM适配方法，通过梯度分析识别关键权重矩阵，使用聚类分解技术提升精度，仅需100个样本即可有效完成下游任务适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LASER方法虽然能提升下游任务精度，但其逐层搜索和全数据集前向传播的计算开销使其难以快速部署。本文旨在消除这种开销，实现快速、高效的LLM适配。

Method: 1) 仅检查少量关键矩阵，消除逐层扫描；2) 使用矩阵奇异值梯度识别需要降维的矩阵；3) 扩展分解搜索空间，允许矩阵行围绕多个子空间聚类并分别分解；4) 仅使用100个样本计算梯度和评估精度。

Result: 该方法进一步减少了对原始训练数据的过拟合，将准确率提升高达24.6个百分点，同时大幅减少了搜索时间。

Conclusion: 结合这些发现，仅需单步梯度和100个样本，就能在不进行微调的情况下快速、稳健地将LLM适配到新数据集。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 双系统学习框架通过分离计算推断(what)和执行(how)，成功解决了持续学习和技能组合问题，展示了在组合性认知任务中实现高效学习和泛化的潜力。

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究通过数据驱动建模方法改进约翰霍普金斯跌倒风险评估工具(JHFRAT)，结合临床知识和电子健康记录数据，使用约束评分优化模型显著提升了跌倒风险预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过数据驱动方法更好地将JHFRAT跌倒风险预测与临床有意义的指标对齐，改进住院患者跌倒预防方案和患者安全。

Method: 对54,209例住院患者进行回顾性分析，使用约束评分优化(CSO)模型结合JHFRAT评估数据和电子健康记录变量，并与当前JHFRAT和XGBoost基准模型进行比较。

Result: CSO模型预测性能显著优于当前JHFRAT(AUC-ROC=0.91 vs 0.86)，与XGBoost性能相当(AUC-ROC=0.94)但更具稳健性，且加入EHR变量对CSO模型性能影响不大。

Conclusion: 这种循证方法为医疗系统使用数据驱动优化技术系统性增强住院患者跌倒预防方案提供了稳健基础，有助于改善风险评估和资源分配。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson采样在序列决策中广泛应用，但其理论基础在复杂时序结构（如强化学习）中仍然有限，需要建立更严格的理论保证。

Method: 使用具有联合高斯过程先验的Thompson采样，分析episodic强化学习设置，处理价值函数的非高斯性质和Bellman更新的递归结构。

Result: 证明了遗憾界限为$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$，其中$K$是episode数，$H$是horizon，$\Gamma(\cdot)$捕捉GP模型的复杂度。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对Thompson采样在强化学习中理解，展示了结构假设和模型不确定性如何影响其在有限horizon马尔可夫决策过程中的性能。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Motivation: 解决多模态融合中如何在保持各模态特征表达能力的同时学习跨模态交互的关键挑战，避免过度强调模态边缘分布对齐导致的过度正则化问题。

Method: 假设每个模态服从多元高斯混合分布，采用狄利克雷过程计算所有分量的混合权重，利用DP的富者愈富特性动态分配特征贡献并选择最显著特征。

Result: 在多个多模态数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型性能优于其他竞争方法，消融分析验证了DP在模态分布对齐中的有效性及其对关键超参数变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的DP驱动多模态学习框架能够自动实现模态内表示学习和跨模态对齐的最佳平衡，为多模态特征融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

TL;DR: 本文研究了270M参数的象棋Transformer模型在分布外场景下的表现，发现模型具有组合泛化能力，能够遵守游戏的基本语法规则，但在更复杂的变体如Chess960中表现不如符号AI算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解象棋规则，而非仅仅学习训练数据中的模式，通过测试其在分布外场景下的系统泛化能力。

Method: 训练270M参数的象棋Transformer模型，并在设计好的分布外场景中进行测试，包括规则外推和Chess960变体，同时分析训练动态。

Result: 模型展现出组合泛化能力，在规则外推测试中能持续选择有效移动，在OOD谜题中生成高质量移动。但在Chess960中表现不如符号AI，尽管与人类玩家对战时差距较小。训练动态显示模型最初只学习移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习象棋的基本组合结构，展现出系统泛化能力，但在需要深度战略推理的复杂变体中仍不如基于显式搜索的符号AI方法。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

TL;DR: BadGraph是针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过文本触发器毒化训练数据，在推理时植入攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成的快速发展，出现了新的安全担忧，特别是后门漏洞。虽然之前的工作探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但条件性特别是文本引导的图生成领域仍未被充分研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器毒化训练数据，在VAE和扩散训练阶段植入后门，当推理时出现触发器时会诱导生成攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的原始性能。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，攻击具有高有效性和隐蔽性：低于10%的中毒率即可达到50%攻击成功率，24%的中毒率足以实现超过80%的成功率，且在良性样本上性能下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，突显了在药物发现等模型应用中的严重风险，并强调了对此类扩散模型中后门攻击进行鲁棒防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文挑战了关于反向/正向KL散度优化的传统直觉，发现在强化学习中，KL散度的选择决定了最优目标分布的参数化形式，而模式覆盖主要取决于正则化强度和其他因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为反向KL导致"模式寻找"，正向KL导致"质量覆盖"，但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习中不一定成立，需要重新理解KL正则化在语言模型训练中的作用。

Method: 通过数学分析和实证研究，构建了一个简单、可扩展且理论合理的算法，通过最小化奖励幅度的修改来优化目标分布，使其覆盖所有高质量采样模式。

Result: 该算法在大型语言模型和化学语言模型的后训练中都表现出更高的解决方案质量和多样性，无需外部多样性信号，且适用于正向和反向KL。

Conclusion: KL散度的选择不是决定模式覆盖的关键因素，正则化强度和其他因素更重要。提出的算法能有效提升模型输出的多样性和质量。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

Motivation: 当前多智能体LLM系统缺乏面向任务的系统性通信框架，无法有效支持复杂工作空间中的多样化通信策略。

Method: 提出对齐因子(AF)量化智能体任务对齐度，结合顺序行动框架集成逐步执行与智能通信决策，实现成本感知的通信选择。

Conclusion: C2C为多智能体系统的通信效果测量建立了理论基础，并为复杂协作任务提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication
strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for
task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a
scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that
directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that
integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C
enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving
task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic
coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17
agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The
results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with
acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully
in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C
establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication
effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex
collaborative tasks.

Result: 实验表明QCoFr在性能上持续表现更好，且提供的可解释性与理论分析一致

Conclusion: QCoFr能有效建模多智能体交互，避免组合爆炸，同时增强合作能力和系统可解释性

Abstract: The ability to model interactions among agents is crucial for effective
coordination and understanding their cooperation mechanisms in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, previous efforts to model high-order
interactions have been primarily hindered by the combinatorial explosion or the
opaque nature of their black-box network structures. In this paper, we propose
a novel value decomposition framework, called Continued Fraction Q-Learning
(QCoFr), which can flexibly capture arbitrary-order agent interactions with
only linear complexity $\mathcal{O}\left({n}\right)$ in the number of agents,
thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion when modeling rich cooperation.
Furthermore, we introduce the variational information bottleneck to extract
latent information for estimating credits. This latent information helps agents
filter out noisy interactions, thereby significantly enhancing both cooperation
and interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QCoFr not only
consistently achieves better performance but also provides interpretability
that aligns with our theoretical analysis.

Motivation: 信息融合正从军事应用的层次结构转向更适合民用和边缘组织的协作式全息融合，这种范式转变由非军事领域信息融合的普及以及人机、机机通信中更灵活的全息结构推动。

Method: 基于多智能体系统模型，研究在资源约束条件下全息结构的生成机制，并通过示例展示其可能运作方式。

Conclusion: 全息结构在资源短缺或系统组件故障时特别有用，为信息融合提供了更灵活和适应性的解决方案。

Abstract: There has recently been a major advance with respect to how information
fusion is performed. Information fusion has gone from being conceived as a
purely hierarchical procedure, as is the case of traditional military
applications, to now being regarded collaboratively, as holonic fusion, which
is better suited for civil applications and edge organizations. The above
paradigm shift is being boosted as information fusion gains ground in different
non-military areas, and human-computer and machine-machine communications,
where holarchies, which are more flexible structures than ordinary, static
hierarchies, become more widespread. This paper focuses on showing how holonic
structures tend to be generated when there are constraints on resources
(energy, available messages, time, etc.) for interactions based on a set of
fully intercommunicating elements (peers) whose components fuse information as
a means of optimizing the impact of vagueness and uncertainty present message
exchanges. Holon formation is studied generically based on a multiagent system
model, and an example of its possible operation is shown. Holonic structures
have a series of advantages, such as adaptability, to sudden changes in the
environment or its composition, are somewhat autonomous and are capable of
cooperating in order to achieve a common goal. This can be useful when the
shortage of resources prevents communications or when the system components
start to fail.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究线性效用函数下的社会选择扭曲问题，分析确定性和随机投票规则的扭曲界限，提出多项式时间实例最优算法，并在推荐系统和语言模型嵌入等实际场景中进行实证评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统社会选择理论基于偏好排序可能导致功利社会福利次优，而许多现实场景中候选者具有向量表示且效用为参数函数，因此需要研究线性效用函数下的扭曲问题。

Method: 研究线性社会选择的确定性和随机投票规则扭曲，提出多项式时间实例最优算法，在协作过滤嵌入和语言模型嵌入两个真实领域进行实证评估。

Result: 获得了仅依赖于候选嵌入维度而与候选者或选民数量无关的扭曲界限，提出的实例最优算法在实证中优于标准规则。

Conclusion: 线性效用函数下的社会选择扭曲分析为价值对齐等场景提供了理论基础，实例最优算法在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Social choice theory offers a wealth of approaches for selecting a candidate
on behalf of voters based on their reported preference rankings over options.
When voters have underlying utilities for these options, however, using
preference rankings may lead to suboptimal outcomes vis-\`a-vis utilitarian
social welfare. Distortion is a measure of this suboptimality, and provides a
worst-case approach for developing and analyzing voting rules when utilities
have minimal structure. However in many settings, such as common paradigms for
value alignment, alternatives admit a vector representation, and it is natural
to suppose that utilities are parametric functions thereof. We undertake the
first study of distortion for linear utility functions. Specifically, we
investigate the distortion of linear social choice for deterministic and
randomized voting rules. We obtain bounds that depend only on the dimension of
the candidate embedding, and are independent of the numbers of candidates or
voters. Additionally, we introduce poly-time instance-optimal algorithms for
minimizing distortion given a collection of candidates and votes. We
empirically evaluate these in two real-world domains: recommendation systems
using collaborative filtering embeddings, and opinion surveys utilizing
language model embeddings, benchmarking several standard rules against our
instance-optimal algorithms.

*L. Elisa Celis,Lingxiao Huang,Milind Sohoni,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个博弈论模型，解释在择优系统中，不同社会经济群体对选拔后价值的感知差异如何理性地导致努力程度差异，从而在看似公平的选拔过程中传播不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解释择优系统中持续存在的种族、性别和阶级差距，探讨这些差距是由结构性不平等还是个人选择造成的，并揭示感知差异如何影响个体努力决策。

Method: 开发了一个博弈论模型，候选人在不同社会经济群体中基于对选拔后价值的感知差异战略性地选择努力程度，努力转化为可观察的才能，选拔仅基于才能。

Result: 模型显示当不同群体对选拔后价值的感知存在差异时，这些差异会转化为努力程度的理性差异，从而在公平选拔过程中传播不平等。提出了成本敏感的优化框架来减少差距。

Conclusion: 感知驱动的偏见是择优系统中不平等的重要机制，技术社会环境通过塑造个体激励来连接理性选择和结构性不平等解释，揭示了择优系统中的一个关键反馈循环。

Abstract: Meritocratic systems, from admissions to hiring, aim to impartially reward
skill and effort. Yet persistent disparities across race, gender, and class
challenge this ideal. Some attribute these gaps to structural inequality;
others to individual choice. We develop a game-theoretic model in which
candidates from different socioeconomic groups differ in their perceived
post-selection value--shaped by social context and, increasingly, by AI-powered
tools offering personalized career or salary guidance. Each candidate
strategically chooses effort, balancing its cost against expected reward;
effort translates into observable merit, and selection is based solely on
merit. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium in the large-agent limit and
derive explicit formulas showing how valuation disparities and institutional
selectivity jointly determine effort, representation, social welfare, and
utility. We further propose a cost-sensitive optimization framework that
quantifies how modifying selectivity or perceived value can reduce disparities
without compromising institutional goals. Our analysis reveals a
perception-driven bias: when perceptions of post-selection value differ across
groups, these differences translate into rational differences in effort,
propagating disparities backward through otherwise "fair" selection processes.
While the model is static, it captures one stage of a broader feedback cycle
linking perceptions, incentives, and outcome--bridging rational-choice and
structural explanations of inequality by showing how techno-social environments
shape individual incentives in meritocratic systems.

### [220] [A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles and the MaxCut Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19835)
*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种量子启发算法，使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)和离散驱动调度解决QUBO问题，在Sudoku和MaxCut问题上成功找到全局最优解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二进制优化(QUBO)问题，该问题在数学上等价于寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态，需要高效算法处理大规模问题

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)紧凑表示自旋构型叠加，结合离散驱动调度引导MPS向基态演化，采用密度矩阵重整化群(DMRG)方法迭代最小化系统能量

Result: 在超过200个自旋的Sudoku问题和Biq Mac库中251节点、3265边的MaxCut问题上可靠识别全局最小值，而不仅仅是近似最优解

Conclusion: 该量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业规模QUBO应用的优势

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

### [221] [Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19836)
*Eliseo Curcio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了分析可靠性基准（ARB），这是首个用于量化大型语言模型在能源系统分析中推理可靠性的标准化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在能源领域的验证实践主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，而缺乏对分析结论逻辑完整性的测试标准。

Method: ARB框架整合了五个子指标：准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性纪律、政策一致性和透明度，使用公开技术经济数据集在确定性、概率性和认知性场景下评估模型性能。

Result: 测试了四种前沿模型，GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet达到了一致且符合政策的推理（分析可靠性指数大于90），Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等，Llama 3 70B低于专业阈值。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信赖和透明的分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Branch-and-Browse是一个细粒度的网页代理框架，通过树状结构探索、网页状态重放和页面动作记忆，显著提升了基于LLM的网页代理在复杂任务中的推理深度和执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自主网页代理方法在推理深度和效率上存在局限：线性方法无法处理多步推理且缺乏有效回溯，而其他搜索策略又过于粗粒度且计算成本高。

Method: 该框架采用显式子任务管理和树状结构探索实现可控的多分支推理，通过网页状态重放进行高效探索，并利用页面动作记忆在会话内外共享已探索的动作。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，Branch-and-Browse实现了35.8%的任务成功率，相比最先进方法执行时间减少了40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的基于LLM的网页代理框架，为开放网络环境中的实际体现推理迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

*Yuanhe Zhang,Ilja Kuzborskij,Jason D. Lee,Chenlei Leng,Fanghui Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于有向无环图(DAG)的框架来评估LLMs在数学推理中的逻辑一致性，超越了传统的PASS@k指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在数学问题上使用思维链(CoT)的成功机制不明确，不清楚是源于搜索、机械记忆还是规则一致推理。需要新的评估方法来衡量推理的逻辑一致性。

Method: 将CoT建模为基于规则的随机过程，使用DAG表示推导状态，引入逻辑接近度指标来量化模型输出与DAG结构的符合程度，并创建DAG-MATH CoT格式的基准测试。

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集上，发现即使PASS@k指标相似，不同LLM家族在推理保真度上存在显著统计差异，揭示了最终答案准确性与规则一致推导之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式CoT和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLMs推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统依赖环境特定接口，限制了跨平台部署能力，需要构建能够在不同环境中通用的智能代理。

Method: 集成层次化上下文管理、解耦的规划与执行、以及具有自适应恢复能力的自我验证机制，支持长任务周期的可靠操作。

Result: 在WebVoyager上达到97.1%准确率，WebArena 69.6%，OSWorld 60.1%，AndroidWorld 87.1%，多次尝试后在所有基准测试中超越人类表现。

Conclusion: 系统化编排能够放大基础模型能力，仅通过视觉交互实现通用计算机控制，但需要下一代视觉语言模型来实现帕累托最优的成本效益。

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long
task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on
WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal
cost-efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE是一个模式无关的图神经网络特征编码器，使用共享的模态特定编码器和交叉注意力模块，在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN需要为每种节点类型和特征列设计特定模块，这限制了可扩展性和参数共享，特别是在处理异构时序图数据时

Method: 使用共享的模态特定编码器处理分类、数值、文本和时间属性，然后通过Perceiver风格的交叉注意力模块将特征聚合成固定大小的节点表示

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，RELATE性能仅比模式特定编码器低3%，但参数数量减少了5倍

Conclusion: RELATE支持不同模式，为关系图数据的通用GNN和多数据集预训练奠定了基础

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

Motivation: 保险欺诈每年造成数百亿美元损失，传统欺诈手段包括伪造事故和文件。生成式AI（如深度伪造图像视频）使欺诈者能轻松制造逼真的事故证据，加剧了保险欺诈问题。

Method: 保险公司部署基于AI的深度伪造检测软件和增强验证流程。UVeye提出分层解决方案，结合多种技术手段来检测车辆欺诈。

Result: 当前检测工具存在误报和漏报问题，欺诈者不断调整策略规避检测。AI驱动的欺诈与检测技术之间形成军备竞赛。

Conclusion: 应对AI驱动的保险欺诈是一个持续挑战，需要更先进的解决方案。UVeye的分层方案代表了检测和威慑这种新型欺诈能力的重大进步。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

Method: 从129名环境工程硕士生收集5个领导力人格测试数据（23个特征），结合平均成绩，使用相关性分析和特征选择，调优7种机器学习算法进行建模。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，包含17个人格特征和领导力标记的模型准确率达87.50%，不包含该特征的模型准确率为85.71%。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,

questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,

Motivation: 基于律师因提交不准确的AI生成内容而受到谴责的案例，以及AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明性的特点与律师诚信、不误导法庭等核心职责之间的矛盾。

Method: 提出验证-价值悖论模型，分析AI在法律实践中使用的效率提升与验证需求之间的平衡关系。

Result: AI在法律实践中的使用带来的效率提升会被相应的手动验证需求所抵消，导致净价值往往可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考AI在法律实践中的使用模式，强调对真相的忠诚和公民责任等价值观应作为法律实践的基础，并对法律教育和实践提出相应建议。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRUST框架，一个去中心化的大语言模型推理审计系统，通过共识机制、分层DAG分解、区块链账本和隐私保护技术，解决了集中式审计的鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明性和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型推理审计方法存在集中化、不透明和难以扩展的问题，在关键领域部署专有模型时存在重大风险。需要解决鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明性和隐私四个核心挑战。

Method: TRUST框架包含：(1)多样化审计者之间的共识机制，确保在30%恶意参与者情况下的正确性；(2)推理轨迹的分层DAG分解，实现可扩展的并行审计；(3)记录所有验证决策的区块链账本；(4)隐私保护的分段共享，仅暴露部分推理步骤。

Result: 在多个大语言模型（GPT-OSS、DeepSeek-r1、Qwen）和各种推理任务（数学、医学、科学、人文）上的实验表明，TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，并对抗性审计者保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRUST框架开创了去中心化AI审计的先河，为大语言模型的安全可信部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

### [233] [The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出AGI发展需要经历从开放模仿到身份固化的锁定阶段，这一阶段涉及目标结构、拒绝行为、偏好和内部表征的相对稳定化，并提出了检测该阶段开始的操作性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型仍保持高度开放和可操控性，通过类比人类发展过程，作者假设AGI进步需要经历身份固化阶段，这是实现AGI级可靠性的前提条件。

Method: 作者形式化了身份固化阶段，将其与学习动力学中的已知现象联系起来，提出了检测该阶段开始的操作性指标，并通过实验验证了行为固化的动态特征。

Result: 实验结果显示行为固化是快速且非线性的，但对通用能力的影响并非单一模式：小型模型出现性能权衡，中等规模模型几乎无成本地实现固化，大型量化模型则出现暂时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份固化是AGI可靠性的必要前提，也是安全性的关键控制点：身份可以被工程化设计以实现可靠性，但也可能在规模扩展过程中自发形成，从而固化不可预测的目标和行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

*Maggie Bai,Ava Kim Cohen,Eleanor Koss,Charlie Lichtenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了在2048游戏中优化AI的进化训练方法，比较了单智能体系统和双智能体系统的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的表现是机器学习研究的基本挑战，2048游戏结合了策略游戏和随机元素，是研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应的理想平台。

Method: 实现两种系统：双智能体元提示系统（一个"思考者"LLM为"执行者"LLM优化策略）和基于蒙特卡洛树搜索价值函数优化的单智能体系统，并尝试了回滚功能以避免性能下降。

Result: 单智能体系统取得显著改进，每个周期平均增加473.2分，训练周期呈明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607），LLM对游戏的理解也随着策略发展而增强；双智能体系统改进有限，突显了元提示的内在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了进化优化技术在非确定性环境中提升AI性能的潜力，单智能体方法比元提示方法更有效。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了个性化认知模拟(ICS)任务，评估不同认知表征方法在模拟个体思维过程中的效果。通过构建基于新出版小说的数据集和11条件认知评估框架，测试了7个现成LLM在作者风格模仿中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM能够模仿表面的人类行为（如角色扮演），但其模拟更深层次个性化认知过程的能力仍不清楚。研究旨在填补这一空白，评估LLM在个性化认知模拟中的表现。

Method: 构建基于新出版小说（晚于测试LLM发布日期）的数据集，提出11条件认知评估框架，测试7个现成LLM在作者风格模仿中的表现。比较不同认知表征方法：语言特征、概念映射和基于档案的信息。

Result: 结合概念和语言特征在ICS中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索。LLM在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，突显了其在更深层次认知模拟中的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推动了更个性化和人类对齐的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

*Bita Banihashemi,Megh Patel,Yves Lespérance*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型通过上下文学习生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，以自然语言指定的抽象目标为基础，在简单设置下能有效合成规划领域抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态领域抽象的选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力，因此需要研究如何生成与特定目标对齐的抽象表示。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，利用大语言模型进行上下文学习，生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，考虑三种抽象类别：替代具体动作选择、具体动作序列、动作/谓词参数及其组合。

Result: GPT-4o在简单设置下能生成有用的规划领域抽象，但在抽象动作方面优于抽象相关流变量。生成的抽象通过符号验证工具和专家评估。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够生成有效的规划领域抽象，特别是在动作抽象方面表现良好，为自动化抽象生成提供了可行方法。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

TL;DR: 提出了STaBERT模型，通过整合POI信息和时间描述符来增强人类移动性预测的语义理解，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用POI提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 在BERT-based移动性模型中引入时间描述符和POI嵌入，构建统一的语义增强移动性表示。

Result: 单城市预测的GEO-BLEU得分从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: STaBERT通过整合POI和时间信息，显著改善了人类移动性预测的准确性和语义理解能力。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

TL;DR: ToolEQA是一个集成外部工具和多步推理的EQA智能体，通过工具提供有用信息来改善探索方向，从而以更短探索距离生成更准确回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EQA方法直接使用VLM探索环境而不进行显式思考或规划，限制了推理能力，导致探索效率低下和无效响应。

Method: 设计ToolEQA智能体，集成外部工具进行多步推理；构建自动化的EQA数据生成流程，收集包含18K任务的EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen上，ToolEQA相比SOTA基线成功率提升9.2~20.2%，比零样本ToolEQA高10%；在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过工具集成和多步推理显著提升了EQA任务的性能，证明了其在各种EQA数据集上的通用性。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了AI在医疗领域应用中的数据偏见问题，基于AI4HealthyAging项目经验，识别了历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见等类型，并提出了改进临床数据收集公平性的实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗领域具有巨大潜力，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，AI解决方案在真实临床实践中的整合仍然有限。主要障碍是数据收集过程中的偏见问题。

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划中的AI4HealthyAging项目经验，通过检测临床数据收集过程中的偏见，识别了多种偏见类型及其在不同用例中的表现。

Result: 识别出多种偏见类型，包括历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见，这些偏见体现在性别、年龄、居住地、社会经济地位、设备和标签等多个变量中。

Conclusion: 提出了改进临床问题设计和数据收集公平性与鲁棒性的实用建议，希望这些发现和经验能为未来开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Result: 模型通过实例化得到演示和评估，为构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中打击AI系统产生的效应提供了透明推理机制，有助于建立负责任的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的出现，知识图谱构建从基于规则和统计的流程转向语言驱动和生成框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变。

Method: 从两个互补视角回顾新兴方法：基于模式的范式强调结构、规范化和一致性；无模式范式强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现。

Result: 系统综合了各阶段的代表性框架，分析了技术机制并识别了局限性，为LLM与知识图谱的交互提供了清晰视角。

Conclusion: 展望了关键趋势和未来研究方向，包括基于KG的LLM推理、智能体系统的动态知识记忆和多模态KG构建，旨在桥接符号知识工程和神经语义理解。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续预训练中指令调优模型语义表示退化和指令跟随能力下降的问题，在无法获取原始基础模型或外部领域数据库的现实场景下提供解决方案。

Method: IKnow框架，基于指令-响应对话格式设计自监督目标，利用文本中嵌入的领域知识，在更深语义层面进行编码学习。

Result: 该方法不依赖外部资源，能够有效保持模型的指令跟随能力，同时适应新的领域数据。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一个简单通用的持续预训练框架，在资源受限场景下实现语言模型的有效领域适应。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EBR的神经推理器，使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，解决了传统描述逻辑推理器在处理不一致和错误数据时的鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经符号概念学习方法依赖描述逻辑推理器，但这些推理器对知识库中的不一致和错误数据不够鲁棒，限制了在实际知识库中的应用。

Method: EBR通过嵌入来近似符号推理器，仅需要检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能近似SHOIQ描述逻辑中任何概念的实例集合。

Result: 实验表明，与最先进的推理器相比，EBR对缺失和错误数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EBR为在真实世界知识库中部署神经符号概念学习方法提供了可行的解决方案，通过神经近似提高了推理的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

TL;DR: FLORA是一个基于模糊逻辑的知识图谱对齐方法，无需训练数据，能够同时对齐实体和关系，并提供可解释的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注实体级对齐，缺乏可解释性且需要训练数据。

Method: 使用模糊逻辑进行迭代式的整体对齐，支持悬空实体，并具有可证明的收敛性。

Result: 在主要基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单有效的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，具有可解释性和高精度。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

*Ali Rajaei,Peter Palensky,Jochen L. Cremer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于图神经网络加速的网络拓扑优化方法，通过母线分裂缓解电网拥堵，实现大规模系统近实时优化，比现有求解器快4个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有求解器无法在近实时内解决大规模电网的混合整数非线性拓扑优化问题，而传统机器学习方法在未见拓扑、运行条件和系统间的泛化能力有限。

Method: 构建考虑线性化交流潮流的网络拓扑优化问题，开发异构边感知消息传递神经网络来预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选解决方案。

Result: 在GOC 2000总线系统上实现4个数量级加速，1分钟内提供交流可行解，最优性差距仅为2.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在拓扑和跨系统泛化方面取得显著进展，为大规模系统近实时网络拓扑优化迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

*Heejin Do,Jaehui Hwang,Dongyoon Han,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法，从相关性和连贯性两个维度评估LLM的推理质量，并通过基于CaSE评估的训练数据提升最终任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仅评估最终答案正确性的方法过于粗糙，忽略了推理过程的质量，无法为模型改进提供有效信号。

Method: 引入CaSE方法，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，使用仅基于前文上下文的逐步评估避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准上验证了CaSE与人工标注的一致性，基于CaSE评估的训练数据能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE为分析、调试和改进LLM推理提供了可扩展框架，证明了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

TL;DR: 提出了两种可扩展的随机游走中心性算法，使用近似Cholesky分解和生成树采样，在超大规模网络上实现近线性时间计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走中心性是图挖掘中量化节点重要性的基本指标，但现有方法在大规模网络上的计算成本过高，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出了两种算法：一种基于近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计，另一种基于根生成树采样，都提供强近似保证。

Result: 在包括超过1000万个节点的大型真实网络上的广泛实验证明了所提算法的高效性和近似质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够在大规模网络上高效计算随机游走中心性，解决了现有方法的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Motivation: 在现实应用中，可解释性设计模型对于建立信任、问责制和安全采用自动化决策模型至关重要。

Method: 形式化定义了监督学习设置，涵盖表格数据、时间序列、图像、文本、交易和轨迹等多种数据类型。分析了特征重要性、规则和实例三类可解释模型家族，并形式化了因果性、公平性和隐私性三个伦理属性。

Result: 建立了开发既准确可解释又公平、保护隐私和因果感知的AI系统的理论基础。

Conclusion: 通过在模型生成过程中评估伦理度量，该框架为开发可信赖的AI系统奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务评估基准存在任务多样性有限、模态单一、数据合成或人工整理、语言覆盖窄等问题，无法可靠评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中的表现。

Method: 采用半自动流程：大模型生成候选回答，50多名电商和多语言专家审核修改；定义难度级别，基于不同规模模型评估得分；主要使用真实客户查询和交易日志数据。

Result: 创建了一个反映真实业务交互噪声和异构性的综合基准，涵盖东南亚5种低资源语言，提供挑战导向的细粒度评估。

Conclusion: EcomEval填补了电子商务领域LLM评估的空白，为实践者提供了评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中能力的可靠工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Motivation: 需要量化模型在动态扩展环境中的适应能力，评估模型对状态变化的理解、预测和调整能力。

Method: 引入Fluidity Index指标，基于环境状态偏差评估响应准确性，区分闭式和开放式基准测试，优先使用闭环开放式真实世界基准测试。

Result: 建立了量化模型适应性的评估框架，能够测量模型在动态环境中的上下文切换和连续性能力。

Conclusion: 真正的超智能模型应至少具备二阶适应性，通过数字补充实现自持计算以达到最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

Motivation: 由于机器学习模型在感知和认知任务中展现出类人能力，将ML集成到理性智能体架构中的框架日益受到关注，但现有研究呈现碎片化和不连贯状态，往往忽视了理性架构的表达能力。

Method: 使用BDI（信念-欲望-意图）范式作为参考框架，对现有方法进行细粒度系统化分析。

Conclusion: 提出了设计有效理性ML智能体的开放挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于拓扑数据分析的评估框架，用于自动评估大语言模型推理轨迹的质量，相比传统图结构指标具有更高预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家标注、人工评分，过程耗时且不可靠，需要更高效的自动化评估方案。

Method: 采用拓扑数据分析方法，捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构特征，实现标签高效的自动化评估。

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理更适合用高维几何结构而非纯关系图来表征。

Conclusion: 紧凑稳定的拓扑特征集能可靠指示推理轨迹质量，为未来强化学习算法提供实用信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调框架，通过"计划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考"范式，使LLM能够在知识不完整条件下进行自主规划和跨KG与网络的自适应检索调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用KG的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，假设KG覆盖完整且缺乏判断何时需要外部信息的机制，推理过程局部短视，无法维持连贯的多步规划。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先通过链式思维微调激活结构化推理，然后通过计划检索引导的强化学习整合显式规划和检索动作，使用笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题，逻辑表达式指导工具调用。

Result: 框架能够有效处理不完整知识条件，实现覆盖感知的检索调度，学习何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT通过创新的强化微调框架解决了KGQA中的规划、检索调度和多步推理问题，显著提升了在复杂场景下的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于广义均值积分的一致性感知AGI度量方法，替代了传统算术平均方法，能够惩罚能力不平衡并捕捉领域间依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义使用算术平均，假设领域间能力可补偿，但真正的通用智能应该反映所有关键领域的平衡能力。

Method: 基于广义均值在补偿性指数连续体上的积分，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值机制，通过曲线下面积量化不同补偿性假设下的鲁棒性。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分，一致性调整的AUC显示尽管算术得分较高（GPT-5达24%），但两个系统距离通用能力仍很远。

Conclusion: 广义均值积分提供了一个原则性、可解释且更严格的AGI进展测量基础。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出Vox-Evaluator多级评估器，通过识别错误语音段边界和提供整体质量评估，指导TTS系统的错误修正和偏好对齐，提升零样本TTS的稳定性和保真度。

Motivation: 当前零样本文本转语音系统在自然度方面取得显著进展，但在稳定性和保真度方面仍存在挑战，表现为发音错误、可听噪声和质量下降。

Method: 1. 开发Vox-Evaluator多级评估器识别错误语音段的时间边界；2. 自动识别声学错误，掩码错误段，基于正确部分重新生成语音；3. 利用评估器的细粒度信息指导TTS模型的偏好对齐；4. 构建带细粒度发音错误或音频质量标注的合成文本-语音数据集。

Conclusion: Vox-Evaluator为解决零样本TTS系统中的稳定性和保真度问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过错误检测和修正机制显著改善了语音合成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), driven by language models,
diffusion models and masked generation, have achieved impressive naturalness in
speech synthesis. Nevertheless, stability and fidelity remain key challenges,
manifesting as mispronunciations, audible noise, and quality degradation. To
address these issues, we introduce Vox-Evaluator, a multi-level evaluator
designed to guide the correction of erroneous speech segments and preference
alignment for TTS systems. It is capable of identifying the temporal boundaries
of erroneous segments and providing a holistic quality assessment of the
generated speech. Specifically, to refine erroneous segments and enhance the
robustness of the zero-shot TTS model, we propose to automatically identify
acoustic errors with the evaluator, mask the erroneous segments, and finally
regenerate speech conditioning on the correct portions. In addition, the
fine-gained information obtained from Vox-Evaluator can guide the preference
alignment for TTS model, thereby reducing the bad cases in speech synthesis.
Due to the lack of suitable training datasets for the Vox-Evaluator, we also
constructed a synthesized text-speech dataset annotated with fine-grained
pronunciation errors or audio quality issues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Vox-Evaluator in enhancing the
stability and fidelity of TTS systems through the speech correction mechanism
and preference optimization. The demos are shown.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证自回归语言模型在统一不同语音增强子任务中的有效性，解决现有方法缺乏统一框架的问题。

Method: 采用仅解码器的语言模型框架，将输入语音特征作为条件，使用自回归建模生成目标语音的离散标记。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得了与判别式和生成式基线方法相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型在统一语音增强任务方面的能力。

Abstract: The development of neural audio codecs (NACs) has largely promoted
applications of language models (LMs) to speech processing and understanding.
However, there lacks the verification on the effectiveness of autoregressive
(AR) LMbased models in unifying different sub-tasks of speech enhancement (SE).
In this work, we propose UniSE, a unified decoder-only LM-based framework to
handle different SE tasks including speech restoration, target speaker
extraction and speech separation. It takes input speech features as conditions
and generates discrete tokens of the target speech using AR modeling, which
facilitates a compatibility between distinct learning patterns of multiple
tasks. Experiments on several benchmarks indicate the proposed UniSE can
achieve competitive performance compared to discriminative and generative
baselines, showing the capacity of LMs in unifying SE tasks. The demo page is

Motivation: 解决传统语音编解码器在声学保真度和语义保持之间的固有冲突，探索从语义能力强的模型出发进行声学重建的新方向。

Method: 通过目标架构简化解锁Whisper的声学建模潜力，利用冻结的简化Whisper编码器构建SimWhisper-Codec，无需外部语义监督。

Result: 在相似比特率下，SimWhisper-Codec在语义保持和声学质量方面均优于Mimi Codec和SpeechTokenizer等语义监督编解码器。

Conclusion: 语义优先方法在语音编解码中具有有效性，通过简化语义能力强的模型可以实现语义和声学质量的平衡。

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between continuous speech signals and large
language models, yet face an inherent conflict between acoustic fidelity and
semantic preservation. To mitigate this conflict, prevailing methods augment
acoustic codecs with complex semantic supervision. We explore the opposite
direction: a semantic-first approach that starts from a semantically-capable
model and adapts it for high-fidelity acoustic reconstruction. Through
empirical analysis, we discover that targeted architectural simplification can
unlock the acoustic modeling potential of Whisper, a text-aligned Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) model. Based on this finding, we propose
SimWhisper-Codec, a novel codec that balances the semantic and acoustic
preservation by leveraging a frozen, simplified Whisper encoder without
requiring external supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that
SimWhisper-Codec achieves superior performance in both semantic preservation
and acoustic quality compared to semantically-supervised codecs such as Mimi
Codec and SpeechTokenizer at similar bitrates, validating the effectiveness of
our semantic-first approach. Code is available at

Result: DeEAR与人类感知的斯皮尔曼等级相关系数达到0.86，不仅能可靠评分，还能进行公平基准测试和针对性数据筛选，显著提升了语音到语音模型的表达力评分。

Conclusion: DeEAR为语音表达力评估提供了可靠框架，通过构建ExpressiveSpeech数据集，显著提升了语音到语音模型的表达力表现。

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still
lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable
evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings,
low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or
incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive
Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech
expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology,
DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and
Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.
Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data
curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but
also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves
the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models.

*Zitong Lan,Yiduo Hao,Mingmin Zhao*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为resounding的任务，通过稀疏测量点估计任意发射器位置的房间脉冲响应，并开发了Versa方法利用声学互易性原理提升声场学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟环境中实现沉浸式听觉体验需要支持动态声源位置的灵活声音建模，但现有方法在稀疏测量点条件下难以准确估计任意位置的声学特性。

Method: 利用声学互易性原理，通过交换发射器和听者位置创建物理有效的密集虚拟发射器位置样本，并提出自监督学习方法解决发射器/听者增益模式带来的挑战。

Result: Versa在模拟和真实数据集上显著提升了声场学习的性能，用户感知研究表明能大幅改善沉浸式空间声音体验。

Conclusion: Versa方法通过物理启发的互易性原理有效解决了稀疏测量条件下的声场学习问题，为虚拟环境中的沉浸式听觉体验提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving immersive auditory experiences in virtual environments requires
flexible sound modeling that supports dynamic source positions. In this paper,
we introduce a task called resounding, which aims to estimate room impulse
responses at arbitrary emitter location from a sparse set of measured emitter
positions, analogous to the relighting problem in vision. We leverage the
reciprocity property and introduce Versa, a physics-inspired approach to
facilitating acoustic field learning. Our method creates physically valid
samples with dense virtual emitter positions by exchanging emitter and listener
poses. We also identify challenges in deploying reciprocity due to
emitter/listener gain patterns and propose a self-supervised learning approach
to address them. Results show that Versa substantially improve the performance
of acoustic field learning on both simulated and real-world datasets across
different metrics. Perceptual user studies show that Versa can greatly improve
the immersive spatial sound experience. Code, dataset and demo videos are
available on the project website: https://waves.seas.upenn.edu/projects/versa.

Method: 1. 通过随机基频扰动和音乐分离伪影模拟进行基于模拟的鲁棒性增强；2. 使用领域特定的歌唱数据丰富说话人表示；3. 集成神经源滤波器模型来显式表示谐波和噪声分量。

Result: R2-SVC在多个歌声转换基准测试中，在干净和噪声条件下都取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该框架通过鲁棒性增强和表现力提升，有效解决了现实世界歌声转换中的噪声和表现力问题。

Abstract: In real-world singing voice conversion (SVC) applications, environmental
noise and the demand for expressive output pose significant challenges.
Conventional methods, however, are typically designed without accounting for
real deployment scenarios, as both training and inference usually rely on clean
data. This mismatch hinders practical use, given the inevitable presence of
diverse noise sources and artifacts from music separation. To tackle these
issues, we propose R2-SVC, a robust and expressive SVC framework. First, we
introduce simulation-based robustness enhancement through random fundamental
frequency ($F_0$) perturbations and music separation artifact simulations
(e.g., reverberation, echo), substantially improving performance under noisy
conditions. Second, we enrich speaker representation using domain-specific
singing data: alongside clean vocals, we incorporate DNSMOS-filtered separated
vocals and public singing corpora, enabling the model to preserve speaker
timbre while capturing singing style nuances. Third, we integrate the Neural
Source-Filter (NSF) model to explicitly represent harmonic and noise
components, enhancing the naturalness and controllability of converted singing.
R2-SVC achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple SVC benchmarks under both
clean and noisy conditions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种可控音乐检索框架，通过嵌入变换实现基于心情引导的音乐检索，在保持其他音乐属性的同时改变特定维度（如心情）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音乐嵌入表示缺乏对单个音乐属性（如心情）的细粒度控制能力，无法在保持其他属性不变的情况下调整特定维度。

Method: 使用基于心情标签的嵌入映射框架，引入采样机制获取代理目标，训练轻量级翻译模型，并提出联合目标函数来平衡变换和信息保留。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验显示，该方法在心情变换方面表现优异，同时在保持流派和乐器方面显著优于无训练基线方法。

Conclusion: 可控嵌入变换为个性化音乐检索提供了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Music representations are the backbone of modern recommendation systems,
powering playlist generation, similarity search, and personalized discovery.
Yet most embeddings offer little control for adjusting a single musical
attribute, e.g., changing only the mood of a track while preserving its genre
or instrumentation. In this work, we address the problem of controllable music
retrieval through embedding-based transformation, where the objective is to
retrieve songs that remain similar to a seed track but are modified along one
chosen dimension. We propose a novel framework for mood-guided music embedding
transformation, which learns a mapping from a seed audio embedding to a target
embedding guided by mood labels, while preserving other musical attributes.
Because mood cannot be directly altered in the seed audio, we introduce a
sampling mechanism that retrieves proxy targets to balance diversity with
similarity to the seed. We train a lightweight translation model using this
sampling strategy and introduce a novel joint objective that encourages
transformation and information preservation. Extensive experiments on two
datasets show strong mood transformation performance while retaining genre and
instrumentation far better than training-free baselines, establishing
controllable embedding transformation as a promising paradigm for personalized
music retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于配置依赖的机器人运动学校准框架，使用局部POE模型和傅里叶基函数插值，显著提高工业机器人在整个工作空间中的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人精确运动学对于工具精确定位至关重要，但非几何因素会引入配置依赖的模型误差，需要改进整个工作空间的精度。

Method: 在多个配置点识别局部POE模型，使用肩部和肘部关节角度参数化的傅里叶基函数进行插值，构建全局模型。

Result: 在两个6自由度工业机器人上的验证显示，最大定位误差减少超过50%，达到亚毫米精度要求，训练效率显著高于神经网络方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效补偿配置依赖的运动学误差，特别适用于配置依赖误差较大的机器人，在冷喷涂制造等应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate robot kinematics is essential for precise tool placement in
articulated robots, but non-geometric factors can introduce
configuration-dependent model discrepancies. This paper presents a
configuration-dependent kinematic calibration framework for improving accuracy
across the entire workspace. Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models,
selected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple
configurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity
load expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized
by the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural
network and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training
efficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed
approach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the
sub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with
larger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot
collaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and
repeatability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非抓取操作中物体物理属性未知和接触丰富交互复杂性的挑战，扩展CI-MPC方法在多样化物体几何和多物体场景中的应用能力。

Method: 开发了Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+)算法，集成物体扫描、网格重建和硬件执行的完整流程，相比前代C3显著提升求解速度。

Result: 在33个物体上实现98%的成功率，1-4物体任务的平均完成时间分别为0.5、1.6、3.2和5.3分钟，支持实时多物体推动操作。

Conclusion: C3+算法有效扩展了CI-MPC的应用范围，能够处理复杂多物体接触推理任务，在真实硬件上表现出色。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation of diverse objects remains a core challenge in
robotics, driven by unknown physical properties and the complexity of
contact-rich interactions. Recent advances in contact-implicit model predictive
control (CI-MPC), with contact reasoning embedded directly in the trajectory
optimization, have shown promise in tackling the task efficiently and robustly,
yet demonstrations have been limited to narrowly curated examples. In this
work, we showcase the broader capabilities of CI-MPC through precise planar
pushing tasks over a wide range of object geometries, including multi-object
domains. These scenarios demand reasoning over numerous inter-object and
object-environment contacts to strategically manipulate and de-clutter the
environment, challenges that were intractable for prior CI-MPC methods. To
achieve this, we introduce Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+), an
enhanced CI-MPC algorithm integrated into a complete pipeline spanning object
scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. Compared to its
predecessor C3, C3+ achieves substantially faster solve times, enabling
real-time performance even in multi-object pushing tasks. On hardware, our
system achieves overall 98% success rate across 33 objects, reaching pose goals
within tight tolerances. The average time-to-goal is approximately 0.5, 1.6,
3.2, and 5.3 minutes for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-object tasks, respectively. Project

Motivation: 传统自主无人机竞速方法受限于预设轨道布局，缺乏真实世界的通用性，需要能处理任意起止状态的最小时间飞行策略。

Method: 使用点质量模型轨迹作为代理奖励近似最优飞行目标，采用课程学习高效扩展训练过程并实现泛化，基于强化学习同时学习状态到状态的最小时间规划与控制。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了无人机任意状态间最小时间飞行的通用策略，在真实环境中表现出良好的泛化性能和计算效率。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning a generalizable minimum-time
flight policy for UAVs, capable of navigating between arbitrary start and goal
states while balancing agile flight and stable hovering. Traditional
approaches, particularly in autonomous drone racing, achieve impressive speeds
and agility but are constrained to predefined track layouts, limiting
real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a reinforcement
learning-based framework that simultaneously learns state-to-state minimum-time
planning and control and generalizes to arbitrary state-to-state flights. Our
approach leverages Point Mass Model (PMM) trajectories as proxy rewards to
approximate the true optimal flight objective and employs curriculum learning
to scale the training process efficiently and to achieve generalization. We
validate our method through simulation experiments, comparing it against
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) tracking PMM-generated trajectories
and conducting ablation studies to assess the impact of curriculum learning.
Finally, real-world experiments confirm the robustness of our learned policy in
outdoor environments, demonstrating its ability to generalize and operate on a
small ARM-based single-board computer.

TL;DR: 本文综述了基于Stewart平台的并联运动机构(PKM)的逆运动学校准方法，分析了外部仪器、约束条件和自校准三种主要方法，重点关注提高平台位置和方向精度的技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stewart平台PKM在医疗、工程、航天等精密应用中需要微纳米级运动控制，因此高精度校准至关重要。传统正向运动学校准过于复杂，而逆运动学校准更为简便有效。

Method: 通过文献综述分析三种主要校准方法：外部仪器校准、约束条件校准和自校准，重点关注逆运动学为基础的PKM校准技术。

Result: 研究发现研究人员主要关注提高平台位置和方向精度，考虑单一或多重误差源，包括结构误差和环境因素，但当前校准多在无负载条件下进行。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在理解该领域最新进展，为其他研究者在特定领域的进一步探索提供参考和扩展空间。

Abstract: Stewart platform-based Parallel Kinematic (PKM) Machines have been
extensively studied by researchers due to their inherent finer control
characteristics. This has opened its potential deployment opportunities in
versatile critical applications like the medical field, engineering machines,
space research, electronic chip manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, etc.
All these precise, complicated, and repeatable motion applications require
micro and nano-scale movement control in 3D space; a 6-DOF PKM can take this
challenge smartly. For this, the PKM must be more accurate than the desired
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a PKM robot is
essential. Forward kinematics-based calibration for such hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To analyze different techniques, an external instrument-based,
constraint-based, and auto or self-calibration-based approaches have been used
for calibration. This survey has been done by reviewing these key
methodologies, their outcome, and important points related to inverse
kinematic-based PKM calibrations in general. It is observed in this study that
the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position and
orientation considering the errors contributed by a single source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly structural, in some cases,
environmental factors are also considered, however, these calibrations are done
under no-load conditions. This study aims to understand the current state of
the art in this field and to expand the scope for other researchers in further
exploration in a specific area.

Motivation: 模块化可重构机器人适合特定任务的空间操作，但形态组合的指数增长阻碍了统一控制。

Method: 采用去中心化强化学习，轮式模块使用SAC算法进行运动控制，7自由度肢体使用PPO算法进行转向和操作控制。

Result: 转向策略的平均绝对误差为3.63度；操作策略在目标偏移标准下达到84.6%成功率；轮式策略相比基线减少95.4%平均电机扭矩，同时保持99.6%成功率。月球模拟测试验证了零样本集成。

Abstract: Modular reconfigurable robots suit task-specific space operations, but the
combinatorial growth of morphologies hinders unified control. We propose a
decentralized reinforcement learning (Dec-RL) scheme where each module learns
its own policy: wheel modules use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion and
7-DoF limbs use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering and
manipulation, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations. In
simulation, the steering policy achieved a mean absolute error of 3.63{\deg}
between desired and induced angles; the manipulation policy plateaued at 84.6 %
success on a target-offset criterion; and the wheel policy cut average motor
torque by 95.4 % relative to baseline while maintaining 99.6 % success.
Lunar-analogue field tests validated zero-shot integration for autonomous
locomotion, steering, and preliminary alignment for reconfiguration. The system
transitioned smoothly among synchronous, parallel, and sequential modes for
Policy Execution, without idle states or control conflicts, indicating a
scalable, reusable, and robust approach for modular lunar robots.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a complex process that creates
free-form geometric objects by sequentially placing material to construct an
object, usually in a layer-by-layer process. One of the most widely used
methods is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). FDM is used in many of the
consumer-grade polymer 3D printers available today. While consumer grade
machines are cheap and plentiful, they lack many of the features desired in a
machine used for research purposes and are often closed-source platforms.
Commercial-grade models are more expensive and are also usually closed-source
platforms that do not offer flexibility for modifications often needed for
research. The authors designed and fabricated a machine to be used as a test
bed for research in the field of polymer FDM processes. The goal was to create
a platform that tightly controls and/or monitors the FDM build parameters so
that experiments can be repeated with a known accuracy. The platform offers
closed loop position feedback, control of the hot end and bed temperature, and
monitoring of environment temperature and humidity. Additionally, the platform
is equipped with cameras and a mechanism for in-situ photogrammetry, creating a
geometric record of the printing throughout the printing process. Through
photogrammetry, backtracking and linking process parameters to observable
geometric defects can be achieved. This paper focuses on the design of a novel
mechanism for spinning the heated bed to allow for photogrammetric
reconstruction of the printed part using a minimal number of cameras, as
implemented on this platform.

Abstract: Robotic arms require precise, task-aware trajectory planning, yet sequence
models that ignore motion structure often yield invalid or inefficient
executions. We present a Path-based Transformer that encodes robot motion with
a 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding,
enforcing lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds while reasoning over task
graphs and action order. Trained on 53,755 trajectories (80% train / 20%

accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, and 90.40% F1 -- with 99.99% of
paths legal by construction. Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6
with a depth-camera digital twin, it attains up to 97.5% reach and 92.5% pick
success in controlled tests, and 86.7% end-to-end success across 60
language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes, absorbing slips and occlusions
via local re-grounding without global re-planning. These results show that
path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate,

Conclusion: 将课程学习与真实吸附模型相结合，为磁吸附爬墙机器人在复杂环境中提供了有弹性的仿真到现实框架。

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing
locomotion that explicitly addresses uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion. A
physics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is
incorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity,
and probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable
reliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait
on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to
vertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic
adhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. The learned policy achieves a
high success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from
detachment in simulation under degraded adhesion. Compared with a model
predictive control (MPC) baseline that assumes perfect adhesion, our controller
maintains locomotion when attachment is intermittently lost. Hardware
experiments with the untethered robot further confirm robust vertical crawling
on steel surfaces, maintaining stability despite transient misalignment and
incomplete attachment. These results show that combining curriculum learning
with realistic adhesion modeling provides a resilient sim-to-real framework for
magnetic climbing robots in complex environments.

Conclusion: FieldGen通过解耦设计结合了可扩展的轨迹多样性和精确监督，为机器人操作提供了高效的数据收集解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic
manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance
scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from
sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with
limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided
data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality
real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes
manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory
diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human
demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an
attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to
successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory
diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments
generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning.
Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher
success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines,
while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data
collection. Webpage is available at https://fieldgen.github.io/.

Abstract: Robots often face manipulation tasks in environments where vision is
inadequate due to clutter, occlusions, or poor lighting--for example, reaching
a shutoff valve at the back of a sink cabinet or locating a light switch above
a crowded shelf. In such settings, robots, much like humans, must rely on
contact feedback to distinguish free from occupied space and navigate around
obstacles. Many of these environments often exhibit strong structural
priors--for instance, pipes often span across sink cabinets--that can be
exploited to anticipate unseen structure and avoid unnecessary collisions. We
present a theoretically complete and empirically efficient framework for
manipulation in the blind that integrates contact feedback with structural
priors to enable robust operation in unknown environments. The framework
comprises three tightly coupled components: (i) a contact detection and
localization module that utilizes joint torque sensing with a contact particle
filter to detect and localize contacts, (ii) an occupancy estimation module
that uses the history of contact observations to build a partial occupancy map
of the workspace and extrapolate it into unexplored regions with learned
predictors, and (iii) a planning module that accounts for the fact that contact
localization estimates and occupancy predictions can be noisy, computing paths
that avoid collisions and complete tasks efficiently without eliminating
feasible solutions. We evaluate the system in simulation and in the real world
on a UR10e manipulator across two domestic tasks--(i) manipulating a valve
under a kitchen sink surrounded by pipes and (ii) retrieving a target object
from a cluttered shelf. Results show that the framework reliably solves these
tasks, achieving up to a 2x reduction in task completion time compared to
baselines, with ablations confirming the contribution of each module.

Abstract: This study experimentally validates the principle of large-scale satellite
swarm control through learning-aided magnetic field interactions generated by
satellite-mounted magnetorquers. This actuation presents a promising solution
for the long-term formation maintenance of multiple satellites and has
primarily been demonstrated in ground-based testbeds for two-satellite position
control. However, as the number of satellites increases beyond three,
fundamental challenges coupled with the high nonlinearity arise: 1)
nonholonomic constraints, 2) underactuation, 3) scalability, and 4)
computational cost. Previous studies have shown that time-integrated current
control theoretically solves these problems, where the average actuator outputs
align with the desired command, and a learning-based technique further enhances
their performance. Through multiple experiments, we validate critical aspects
of learning-aided time-integrated current control: (1) enhanced controllability
of the averaged system dynamics, with a theoretically guaranteed error bound,
and (2) decentralized current management. We design two-axis coils and a
ground-based experimental setup utilizing an air-bearing platform, enabling a
mathematical replication of orbital dynamics. Based on the effectiveness of the
learned interaction model, we introduce NODA-MMH (Neural power-Optimal Dipole
Allocation for certified learned Model-based Magnetically swarm control
Harness) for model-based power-optimal swarm control. This study complements
our tutorial paper on magnetically actuated swarms for the long-term formation
maintenance problem.

TL;DR: Kinaema模型是一种用于机器人空间定位的循环变换器模型，能够通过隐式潜在记忆整合视觉观察流，在大型场景中预测查询图像的相对位置，无需显式存储观察历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在连续操作中利用先前观察信息进行高效定位的问题，特别是在大型场景中实现'找到方向'的能力。

Method: 使用循环变换器维护隐式潜在记忆，通过压缩传感器读数历史为紧凑表示，避免显式存储观察历史带来的上下文长度限制。

Result: 模型在Mem-Nav任务中表现出色，能够维持有用的场景表示，导航到在剧集开始前观察到的目标位置，计算效率优于基于观察历史注意力的经典变换器。

Conclusion: Kinaema模型通过隐式记忆机制有效解决了机器人空间定位问题，在计算效率和场景表示能力方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

TL;DR: 提出MemER分层策略框架，让机器人策略具备记忆能力，通过高层策略选择相关历史关键帧，结合最近帧生成指令给底层策略执行，在需要长时间记忆的机器人操作任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类依赖记忆执行任务，但现有机器人策略缺乏这种能力。直接使用长观察历史计算昂贵且易受协变量偏移影响，而随机采样历史会导致信息不相关或冗余。

Method: 分层策略框架：高层策略训练用于选择和跟踪历史相关关键帧，使用选中的关键帧和最新帧生成文本指令给底层VLA模型执行。基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct和π0.5模型微调。

Result: MemER在三个需要分钟级记忆的真实世界长视野机器人操作任务中优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容现有VLA模型，能有效推理长视野依赖关系，为机器人策略赋予记忆能力。

Abstract: Humans routinely rely on memory to perform tasks, yet most robot policies
lack this capability; our goal is to endow robot policies with the same
ability. Naively conditioning on long observation histories is computationally
expensive and brittle under covariate shift, while indiscriminate subsampling
of history leads to irrelevant or redundant information. We propose a
hierarchical policy framework, where the high-level policy is trained to select
and track previous relevant keyframes from its experience. The high-level
policy uses selected keyframes and the most recent frames when generating text
instructions for a low-level policy to execute. This design is compatible with
existing vision-language-action (VLA) models and enables the system to
efficiently reason over long-horizon dependencies. In our experiments, we
finetune Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and $\pi_{0.5}$ as the high-level and low-level
policies respectively, using demonstrations supplemented with minimal language
annotations. Our approach, MemER, outperforms prior methods on three real-world
long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that require minutes of memory. Videos

TL;DR: Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP) 是一个领域无关的自主停车系统，结合视觉基础模型和基于扩散的规划，在分布偏移下实现泛化感知和鲁棒运动规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端方法在领域内表现良好，但在领域偏移（如天气和光照变化）下的鲁棒性仍是关键挑战。

Method: 集成视觉基础模型与基于扩散的规划，在CARLA中训练并在对抗性设置中进行零样本迁移。

Conclusion: 在从真实世界停车场重建的3D高斯泼溅环境中测试显示，具有有前景的仿真到真实迁移能力。

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

*Yijiong Lin,Bowen Deng,Chenghua Lu,Max Yang,Efi Psomopoulou,Nathan F. Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuralTouch是一个多模态框架，结合神经描述场(NDF)和触觉传感，通过轻柔物理交互实现准确、可泛化的抓取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：NDF单独使用会因相机标定不完美、点云不完整和物体变化性产生不准确位姿；触觉传感方法通常局限于简单预定义接触几何。需要结合视觉和触觉优势实现精确抓取。

Method: 利用NDF隐式表示目标接触几何，训练基于神经描述符的深度强化学习策略，使用触觉反馈来优化抓取位姿，无需显式指定接触类型。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界操作任务（如孔轴装配和瓶盖开启）中实现零样本迁移，无需额外微调，显著提高了抓取准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NeuralTouch为精确、接触丰富的机器人操作提供了一个通用框架，通过视觉和触觉的融合实现了更好的抓取性能。

Abstract: Grasping accuracy is a critical prerequisite for precise object manipulation,
often requiring careful alignment between the robot hand and object. Neural
Descriptor Fields (NDF) offer a promising vision-based method to generate
grasping poses that generalize across object categories. However, NDF alone can
produce inaccurate poses due to imperfect camera calibration, incomplete point
clouds, and object variability. Meanwhile, tactile sensing enables more precise
contact, but existing approaches typically learn policies limited to simple,
predefined contact geometries. In this work, we introduce NeuralTouch, a
multimodal framework that integrates NDF and tactile sensing to enable
accurate, generalizable grasping through gentle physical interaction. Our
approach leverages NDF to implicitly represent the target contact geometry,
from which a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy is trained to refine the
grasp using tactile feedback. This policy is conditioned on the neural
descriptors and does not require explicit specification of contact types. We
validate NeuralTouch through ablation studies in simulation and zero-shot
transfer to real-world manipulation tasks--such as peg-out-in-hole and bottle
lid opening--without additional fine-tuning. Results show that NeuralTouch
significantly improves grasping accuracy and robustness over baseline methods,
offering a general framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出PointMapPolicy方法，通过结构化点网格结合扩散策略，融合点云和RGB数据，在机器人操作任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前点云方法难以捕捉细粒度细节，RGB方法缺乏几何感知，限制了机器人操作的精度和泛化能力。需要结合两种模态的优势。

Method: 使用结构化点网格作为扩散策略的输入，无需下采样，便于提取形状和空间关系。采用xLSTM作为骨干网络，融合点图和RGB数据。

Result: 在RoboCasa和CALVIN基准测试以及真实机器人评估中，该方法在多样化操作任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PointMapPolicy通过结构化点网格有效融合多模态感知，提升了机器人操作的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems benefit from complementary sensing modalities,
where each provides unique environmental information. Point clouds capture
detailed geometric structure, while RGB images provide rich semantic context.
Current point cloud methods struggle to capture fine-grained detail, especially
for complex tasks, which RGB methods lack geometric awareness, which hinders
their precision and generalization. We introduce PointMapPolicy, a novel
approach that conditions diffusion policies on structured grids of points
without downsampling. The resulting data type makes it easier to extract shape
and spatial relationships from observations, and can be transformed between
reference frames. Yet due to their structure in a regular grid, we enable the
use of established computer vision techniques directly to 3D data. Using xLSTM
as a backbone, our model efficiently fuses the point maps with RGB data for
enhanced multi-modal perception. Through extensive experiments on the RoboCasa
and CALVIN benchmarks and real robot evaluations, we demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: MR-UBi通过视觉和触觉反馈的集成，实现了更稳定、准确和用户友好的水下机器人手臂遥操作。

Abstract: We present a mixed reality-based underwater robot arm teleoperation system
with a reaction torque indicator via bilateral control (MR-UBi). The reaction
torque indicator (RTI) overlays a color and length-coded torque bar in the
MR-HMD, enabling seamless integration of visual and haptic feedback during
underwater robot arm teleoperation. User studies with sixteen participants
compared MR-UBi against a bilateral-control baseline. MR-UBi significantly
improved grasping-torque control accuracy, increasing the time within the
optimal torque range and reducing both low and high grasping torque range
during lift and pick-and-place tasks with objects of different stiffness.
Subjective evaluations further showed higher usability (SUS) and lower workload
(NASA--TLX). Overall, the results confirm that \textit{MR-UBi} enables more
stable, accurate, and user-friendly underwater robot-arm teleoperation through
the integration of visual and haptic feedback. For additional material, please

Motivation: 当移动零件比移动工具更容易时，需要一种能够规划固定TCP轨迹的方法，同时考虑零件加工路径。

Method: 使用B样条表示机器人路径，确保路径连续性和平滑轨迹。在计算机器人轨迹时考虑预设方向和TCP的给定速度。

Result: 该方法在工业机器人移动任意定义零件的真实系统上得到验证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效规划固定TCP的轨迹，生成平滑的机器人运动路径，并在实际系统中验证了可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for planning a trajectory in workspace
coordinates using a spatially fixed tool center point (TCP), while taking into
account the processing path on a part. This approach is beneficial if it is
easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical
description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a
design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines.
The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree,
which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot
trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the
TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an
industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.

Conclusion: 该方法能够适应变化条件，利用可靠数据辅助受传感器退化影响的机器人，为多机器人系统在挑战性环境中的长期精确定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate long-term localization using onboard sensors is crucial for robots
operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments.
While complementary sensors mitigate individual degradations, carrying all the
available sensor types on a single robot significantly increases the size,
weight, and power demands. Distributing sensors across multiple robots enhances
the deployability but introduces challenges in fusing asynchronous, multi-modal
data from independently moving platforms. We propose a novel adaptive
multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach using a factor-graph
formulation to fuse asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial
Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections from distinct robots in a
loosely-coupled fashion. The approach adapts to changing conditions, leveraging
reliable data to assist robots affected by sensory degradations. A novel
interpolation-based factor enables fusion of the unsynchronized measurements.
LIO degradations are evaluated based on the approximate scan-matching Hessian.
A novel approach of weighting odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein
distance between the consecutive VIO outputs is proposed. A theoretical
analysis is provided, investigating the cooperative localization problem under
various conditions, mainly in the presence of sensory degradations. The
proposed method has been extensively evaluated on real-world data gathered with
heterogeneous teams of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), showing that the approach provides significant improvements in
localization accuracy in the presence of various sensory degradations.

Motivation: 解决在未知动力学（如有效载荷不确定性）下机器人操作任务的问题，需要主动探索和在线参数适应来实现准确的基于模型的控制。

Method: 将问题构建为双重控制问题，预定义反馈策略结构包含显式适应机制，提出两种参考轨迹生成方法：一种在鲁棒最优控制中嵌入参数不确定性，另一种考虑最小化最优性损失。

Result: 两种方法都自然地考虑了Fisher信息，同时追求最优任务执行，在拾取-放置操作任务中表现出更快速、更准确的任务性能和系统辨识能力。

Conclusion: 在考虑控制的同时设计参考轨迹，能够实现更快更准确的任务性能和系统辨识，同时确保稳定高效的控制。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of robot manipulation tasks under unknown
dynamics, such as pick-and-place tasks under payload uncertainty, where active
exploration and(/for) online parameter adaptation during task execution are
essential to enable accurate model-based control. The problem is framed as dual
control seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for
parameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the
structure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism.
Then we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first
directly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that
minimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the
so-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant
information with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches
reason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their
formulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We
show that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the
control enables faster and more accurate task performance and system
identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.

Conclusion: 利用SEA弹性元件的固有振动特性，通过同时优化轨迹和驱动器刚度，可以有效降低拾取-放置任务的能耗，为并联机器人设计提供指导。

Abstract: A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks
that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place
operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed.
These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore
minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses
this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic
actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy
consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea
is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit
their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic
pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is
derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is
formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are
optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not
account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design
and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two
(parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The
results confirm the validity of this approach.

Motivation: 传统时间最优路径跟踪方法在将优化问题重新参数化为路径参数时，在零路径速度处会产生奇异性，这使得在保持低计算量的同时生成平滑轨迹变得困难。

Method: 提出了一种基于最大化路径速度的新方法，能够高效规划平滑轨迹，且问题的离散化重构在优化变量上是线性的。

Result: 该方法能够有效避免奇异性问题，实现平滑轨迹的数值高效规划。

Conclusion: 通过最大化路径速度的方法可以有效解决时间最优路径跟踪中的计算挑战，提供了一种数值高效的平滑轨迹规划方案。

Abstract: In this paper the computational challenges of time-optimal path following are
addressed. The standard approach is to minimize the travel time, which
inevitably leads to singularities at zero path speed, when reformulating the
optimization problem in terms of a path parameter. Thus, smooth trajectory
generation while maintaining a low computational effort is quite challenging,
since the singularities have to be taken into account. To this end, a different
approach is presented in this paper. This approach is based on maximizing the
path speed along a prescribed path. Furthermore, the approach is capable of
planning smooth trajectories numerically efficient. Moreover, the discrete
reformulation of the underlying problem is linear in optimization variables.

Conclusion: RubbleSim为研究空隙空间探索提供了可访问的解决方案，克服了真实数据获取的障碍，并展示了在恶劣视觉条件下的感知挑战。

Abstract: Despite well-reported instances of robots being used in disaster response,
there is scant published data on the internal composition of the void spaces
within structural collapse incidents. Data collected during these incidents is
mired in legal constraints, as ownership is often tied to the responding
agencies, with little hope of public release for research. While engineered
rubble piles are used for training, these sites are also reluctant to release
information about their proprietary training grounds. To overcome this access
challenge, we present RubbleSim -- an open-source, reconfigurable simulator for
photorealistic void space exploration. The design of the simulation assets is
directly informed by visits to numerous training rubble sites at differing
levels of complexity. The simulator is implemented in Unity with
multi-operating system support. The simulation uses a physics-based approach to
build stochastic rubble piles, allowing for rapid iteration between simulation
worlds while retaining absolute knowledge of the ground truth. Using RubbleSim,
we apply a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm to illustrate how
perception performance degrades under challenging visual conditions inside the
emulated void spaces. Pre-built binaries and source code to implement are
available online: https://github.com/mit-ll/rubble_pile_simulator.

Motivation: 现有物体导航方法依赖静态轨迹和固定物体类别训练，忽略了现实世界需要持续适应变化场景的需求，因此需要研究持续学习能力。

Method: C-Nav框架包含：1）双路径抗遗忘机制（特征蒸馏确保表示一致性，特征回放确保策略一致性）；2）自适应采样策略选择多样化和信息丰富的经验。

Result: 在多种模型架构上的实验表明，C-Nav持续优于现有方法，即使与保留完整轨迹的基线相比也表现更优，同时显著降低内存需求。

Conclusion: C-Nav为解决持续物体导航问题提供了有效方案，在性能和内存效率方面均表现出色，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Embodied agents are expected to perform object navigation in dynamic,
open-world environments. However, existing approaches typically rely on static
trajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking
the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To
facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation
benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object
categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned
knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual
navigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path
anti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns
multi-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure
representation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features
within the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive
sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby
reducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments
across multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently
outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared
to baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering
memory requirements. The code will be publicly available at
https://bigtree765.github.io/C-Nav-project.

Motivation: 解决无模型强化学习策略往往收敛到单一步态导致性能次优的问题，以及传统模型预测控制缺乏环境适应能力的局限性。

Method: 在每个时间步，MPPI联合优化动作和步态变量，使用学习的Dreamer奖励函数来促进速度跟踪、能效、稳定性和平滑过渡，同时惩罚突变的步态变化。结合学习到的价值函数作为终端奖励，将规划扩展到无限时域。

Result: 在Unitree Go1仿真中评估，在变化的目标速度下平均能耗降低高达36.48%，同时保持准确的跟踪和自适应、任务适当的步态。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了四足机器人的实时步态自适应，在保持跟踪精度的同时显著提高了能效，证明了在连续步态空间中优化步态策略的有效性。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptable and agile
quadruped locomotion; however, policies often converge to a single gait,
leading to suboptimal performance. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has been extensively used to obtain task-specific optimal policies but
lacks the ability to adapt to varying environments. To address these
limitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation
in a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
algorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for
quadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and
gait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking,
energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt
gait changes. A learned value function is incorporated as terminal reward,
extending the formulation to an infinite-horizon planner. We evaluate our
framework in simulation on the Unitree Go1, demonstrating an average reduction
of up to 36.48\% in energy consumption across varying target speeds, while
maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits.

Abstract: Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various
robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such
achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical
tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in
real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and
approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and
real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly
hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.
Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.
Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results
across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation.
By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer,
state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have
overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper
understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In
this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape,
highlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap
and sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real
policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering
of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian
Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with
robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we
curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data
collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual
reinforcement learning. Website: https://3dgsworld.github.io/.

Conclusion: 分层设计是实现跨具身导航的关键，专用可及性模型对具身基础至关重要，使单一高层规划器能部署到物理特性不同的轮式和腿式机器人上。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that
generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical
constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can
walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that
decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner
learns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model
learns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost
simulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that
lets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that
the affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments
show that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex
outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning
methods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied
navigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using
natural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key
to embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed
across physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model
significantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success
rates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:
