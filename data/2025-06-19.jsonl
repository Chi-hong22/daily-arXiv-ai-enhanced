Its\nexistence remains elusive -- even for four agents with additive utility\nfunctions, it is unknown whether an EFX allocation always exists.\nUnsurprisingly, restricted settings to delineate tractable and intractable\ncases have been explored. Christadolou, Fiat et al.[EC'23] introduced the\nnotion of EFX-orientation, where the agents form the vertices of a graph and\nthe items correspond to edges, and an agent values only the items that are\nincident to it. The goal is to allocate items to one of the adjacent agents\nwhile satisfying the EFX condition.\n  Building on the work of Zeng and Mehta'24, which established a sharp\ncomplexity threshold based on the structure of the underlying graph --\npolynomial-time solvability for bipartite graphs and NP-hardness for graphs\nwith chromatic number at least three -- we further explore the algorithmic\nlandscape of EFX-orientation using parameterized graph algorithms.\n  Specifically, we show that bipartiteness is a surprisingly stringent\ncondition for tractability: EFX orientation is NP-complete even when the\nvaluations are symmetric, binary and the graph is at most two edge-removals\naway from being bipartite. Moreover, introducing a single non-binary value\nmakes the problem NP-hard even when the graph is only one edge removal away\nfrom being bipartite. We further perform a parameterized analysis to examine\nstructures of the underlying graph that enable tractability. In particular, we\nshow that the problem is solvable in linear time on graphs whose treewidth is\nbounded by a constant and that the complexity of an instance is closely tied to\nthe sizes of acyclic connected components on its one-valued edges."}

While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary\noptimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft\nconstraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce\nfeasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the\npowerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by\nadding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This\nscheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to\nlow-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel\ntempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and\neliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a\nrepresentative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT\nachieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as\nO(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of\nmagnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas.

While this assumption is harmless to make in some\nsituations, it can be inefficient or even infeasible in others. In this paper,\nwe consider assigning multi-robot tasks to multitasking robots. The key\ncontribution is a novel task allocation framework that incorporates the\nconsideration of physical constraints introduced by multitasking. This is in\ncontrast to the existing work where such constraints are largely ignored. After\nformulating the problem, we propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, which\nallows us to leverage existing solvers for a solution. A more efficient greedy\nheuristic is then introduced. For evaluation, we first compare our methods with\na modern baseline that is efficient for single-tasking robots to validate the\nbenefits of multitasking in synthetic domains. Then, using a site-clearing\nscenario in simulation, we further illustrate the complex task interaction\nconsidered by the multitasking robots in our approach to demonstrate its\nperformance.

A conventional approach to mitigate\nthis issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single\nlane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of\nmulti-deep storage systems.\n  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to\naddress the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous\nitem configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the\nobjective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's\ntopology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both\nitem attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep\nwarehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network\narchitecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer\nmodel. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into\nembeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these\nembeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong\ngeneralization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage\nsystems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including\ncomparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nneural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in\noptimizing retrieval tardiness."}

To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a\ndata-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1)\nautomated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic\nselection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3)\nevaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean\nopinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance.\nFurthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a\nclosed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data\ncleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model.

Our work addresses these\nchallenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally\nadvance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.\nFirst, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the\nintegration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves\nthe stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization\nobjective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to\naddress the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which\nseverely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly\nintroduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and\nunlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated\nself-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to\nsynergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the\niterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that\nMonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular\nbenchmark.

In particular, we design a\nfirst-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number\nof counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a\nresult, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that\nallows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.\nAs an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the\ndirectional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal\nlinear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our\ntheoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments."}

However, conventional annotation methods heavily\nrely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing\nnon-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these\nchallenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that\nautomates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic\nannotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural\nnetworks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and\nincorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail\nenvironments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach\nover traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator\nlabeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.\nRemarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video\nannotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of\ndetected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process\nfor the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can\nsignificantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection\nenables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,\nproving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey\nanalysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring."}

How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these\nselected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the\nquality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.\nRemarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our\nmethod achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy.

To address this limitation, we introduce\nSupervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that\ntreats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups\ntokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM\nusing a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard\ncross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging\ntoken groups and guides the model to better handle different group\ndistributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a\ntheoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its\nefficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping\nstrategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform\nbaseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold\nacross various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the\neffectiveness of our method."}

Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,\nVQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached\nfeatures, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual\ninputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally\n``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer."}

To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated.

However,\nthe data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased\nand noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects\nmodel performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.\nTo tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label\nCorrection (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while\npreserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines\nthree key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization\nthrough Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity\nincentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed\napproach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance\nand fairness metrics compared to the baseline."}

Two\ncritical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training\ninstability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the\ngradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially\nin the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse\noccurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A\ncloser examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a\nmismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to\nunrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during\ncompression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these\ntwo distributions, achieving near 100\\% codebook utilization and significantly\nreducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

However, in complex environments,\nthe number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical\nproperties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a\nsingle global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system\nidentification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant\naspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation\nof energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility\nfor any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,\nparticularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model\nPredictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it\ncontext-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system\nidentification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed\ncontrol. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the\nfact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our\nmethod on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our\nmethod reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%\nimprovement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter."}

The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven\nto be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical\nimaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag\npotential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD\ndetection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works\nsuggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,\nwe propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages\nneuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster\nneuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form\nrepresentative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify\na new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.\nAdditionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the\nbias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable\nOOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning\narchitectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and\nGastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection\nmethods."}

Unlike traditional\nAI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the\nchallenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We\nempirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the\nMetropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference\nmechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention\nnaming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,\nalways-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that\nhuman-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization\naccuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared\nsign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the\nMH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical\nevidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based\ninteraction.

We introduce \\textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based\nReward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency\nand output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a\nmargin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to\nidentify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second\nstage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or\nexhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded\nevaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence\ncontinuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions\nthat are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and\nexplanatory, while achieving over 4$\\times$ speedup compared to existing\nvalue-guided methods.
